       "'The Nature of Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia Goals. To understand the nature of panic attacks, panic disorder, and agoraphobia. To learn about factors that cause panic disorder. To learn about this program for overcoming panic and agoraphobia. To determine whether or not this program is right for you Do You Have Panic Disorder or Agoraphobia? Do you have rushes of fear that make you think that you are sick, dying, or losing your mind? When these panicky feelings happen, does it feel as if your heart is going to burst out of your chest or as if you cannot get enough air? Or maybe you feel dizzy, faint, trembly, sweaty, short of breath, or just scared to death. Do the feelings sometimes come from out of the blue, when you least expect them? Are you worried about when these feelings will happen again? Do these feelings interfere with your normal daily routine or prevent you from doing things that you would normally do? If these descriptions apply to you, then you may be suffering from panic disorder and agoraphobia. The rushes of fear are called panic attacks. Usually, panic attacks are accompanied by general anxiety about the possibility of another attack. Together, the panic attacks and general anxiety are called panic disorder. Agoraphobia refers to anxiety about, or avoidance of, situations where panic attacks or other physical symptoms are expected to occur. These terms are described in more detail later. Here are some examples of how panic disorder and agoraphobia can affect people\\'s lives. 1 Chapter 1 Case Studies Steve. Steve was a -year-old sales manager who suffered from attacks of dizziness, blurred vision, and heart palpitations. The first panic attack occurred at work, in the presence of his coworkers, and began with feelings of weakness, nausea, and dizziness. Steve asked a colleague to call a doctor because he was afraid that he was having a heart attack since his father had recently died of one. In addition to this personal loss, Steve was dealing with a lot of stress at work. Several months before the first panic attack, there were times when Steve had been nervous and his writing had become shaky; but apart from that, he had never experienced anything like this before. After a thorough physical examination, his doctor told him that it was stress and anxiety. Nevertheless, the panics continued, mostly at work, and in trapped situations. Sometimes they were unexpected orout of the blue, particularly the ones that woke him out of deep sleep. Steve felt tense and anxious most of the time because he worried about having another panic attack. Since his third panic attack, Steve had begun to avoid being alone whenever possible. He also avoided places and situations, such as stores, shopping malls, crowds, theaters, and waiting in lines, where he feared being trapped and embarrassed if he panicked. Wherever he went, Steve carried a Bible, as well as chewing gum and cigarettes, because glancing at the Bible, chewing gum, or smoking cigarettes made him feel more comfortable and better able to cope. In addition, Steve took medication with him wherever he went to help deal with his panic attacks.. Lisa. Lisa was a -year-old woman who had repeated attacks of dizziness, breathlessness, chest pain, blurred vision, a lump in her throat, and feelings of unreality. She was afraid that these feelings meant that something was wrong with her brain, such as a tumor, or that she was losing control of her mind. The problem began about five years before. While at a party, Lisa smoked some marijuana, and within a short while, she began to feel very unreal and dizzy. Never having had these feelings before, Lisa thought that she was going insane or that the drug had damaged her brain. She asked a friend 2 to take her to the emergency room. The physicians did some tests and reassured Lisa that her symptoms were due to anxiety. Lisa never touched marijuana or other recreational drugs after that. In fact, she became nervous about any chemical substances, even ones prescribed for allergies and sinus infections. The panic attacks waxed and waned over the years. At one point, she had no attacks for three months. However, she continued to worry about having another panic attack almost all of the time. She felt uneasy in situations where it would be difficult to get help if another panic attack occurred, such as in unfamiliar places or when she was alone, but she did not actually avoid many places. Her method of coping with panic was to get as involved as she could in other things so as to keep her mind off panic.. Judy. Judy was a -year-old, married woman who was unemployed because of her panic attacks. Judy quit her job as a paralegal several years ago because it had become increasingly difficult for her to leave her house. Judy\\'s panic attacks involved strong chest pains and feelings of pressure on her chest, numbness in her left arm, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations. Each time she panicked, Judy was terrified that she was dying of a heart attack. In addition, Judy frequently woke up out of deep sleep with similar feelings, particularly pressure on her chest, shortness of breath, and sweating. Judy lived with her extended family, which was of Chinese descent and believed that the nighttime events represented demons descending on her. Her grandmother convinced Judy that she would die if she did not wake up in time. Consequently, Judy became very afraid to go to sleep. She would spend many hours pacing the floors when everyone else was asleep. Instead, she napped throughout the day, when other people were around. Her life had become very restricted to the house, with occasional outings to stores and doctors as long as a family member or friend accompanied her. Judy had seen many doctors and cardiologists, and she had undergone several cardiovascular stress tests and a halter recording to measure her heart over extended periods of time. Nothing was detected, and yet Judy remained convinced that she would have a heart attack or that she would die in her sleep.. 3 Diagnosis and Definition of Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia The mental health classification system used in the United States and many other countries, referred to as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR; APA, ), identifies the problem addressed in this workbook as panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. The key features of panic disorder are: (?) one or more episodes of abrupt, intense fear or discomfort (i.e., a panic attack); and (?) persistent anxiety or worry about the recurrence of panic attacks, their consequences, or life changes as a result of the attacks. Panic attacks refer to an abrupt rush of intense fear or discomfort accompanied by a number of physical and cognitive symptoms, which are listed below. Occasional panic attacks are common. However, not everyone who experiences occasional panic attacks develops panic disorder. Details about the frequency of panic attacks and panic disorder in the general population are described in a later section. Panic Attack Symptoms. Shortness of breath or smothering sensations. Heart palpitations or a racing or pounding heart. Chest pain or discomfort. Trembling or shaking. Feelings of choking. Sweating. Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint. Hot or cold flashes. Nausea or abdominal distress. Feelings of unreality or detachment. Numbness or tingling. Fears of dying. Fears of going insane or losing control 4 Panic attacks occur as a part of many different anxiety problems. However, in other anxiety problems, panic attacks usually are not what the person is most worried about. In panic disorder, the panic attacks become the major source of concern and worry. Continuing with the technical definition of panic disorder, at least one of the panic attacks must be unexpected or occur for no real reason. In other words, the panic seems to occur fromout of the blue. A good example of an unexpected panic attack is an attack that occurs when relaxing or when deeply asleep. For some people, panic attacks continue to occur unexpectedly, and for other people, the panic attacks eventually become tied to specific situations. Another feature of panic disorder is avoiding, hesitating about, or feeling very nervous in situations where panic attacks or other physical symptoms (such as diarrhea) are expected to occur. Typically, these situations are ones where you may not be able to escape or find help. A common example is a crowded shopping mall, where it might be hard to find the exit and difficult to get through all the people if one has to leave suddenly because of a panic attack. A list of typical agoraphobia situations is provided in the list below. Avoiding situations because of fear when no real danger exists is called a phobia. Avoiding situations from which escape might be difficult or where help may be unavailable in the event of a panic attack or other physical symptoms is called agoraphobia. This is fitting because the agora was the ancient Greek marketplacethe original shopping mall. However, as can be seen from the list below, places and situations avoided by people with agoraphobia are not limited to malls. Typical Agoraphobia Situations. Driving. Traveling by subway, bus, or taxi. Flying. Waiting in lines. Crowds. Stores. Restaurants 5. Theaters. Long distances from home. Unfamiliar areas. Hairdressing salon or barbershop. Long walks. Wide, open spaces. Closed-in spaces (e.g., basements). Boats. Being at home alone. Auditoriums. Elevators. Escalators In most cases, agoraphobia develops after panic attacks, resulting in panic disorder with agoraphobia. However, some people never develop agoraphobia; they have panic disorder without agoraphobia. Occasionally, agoraphobia is present without panic attacks, in which case the official term is agoraphobia without history of panic disorder. In this case, the person may experience one, two, or three symptoms from the list of panic attack symptoms but never has had four or more symptoms at one time (which is the technical requirement for a full-blown panic attack). Nevertheless, one or two symptoms can be as distressing as four or more symptoms. For example, lightheadedness is sometimes the only symptom experienced, but anxiety about feeling lightheaded can be as severe and disabling as the anxiety about having a full-blown panic attack. Putting it another way, the person who has lightheadedness only may end up becoming as agoraphobic as the person who has lightheadedness plus many other panic attack symptoms. Another example of agoraphobia without panic disorder is when abdominal distress is the primary symptom, resulting in hesitation about entering situations where restrooms are not easily accessible. Abdominal distress may be part of irritable bowel syndrome, which involves a chronic disturbance in bowel habits and includes nausea, stomach cramping, constipation, or 6 diarrhea. These types of symptoms are not due to a medical condition and are often intensified by stress, such as the stress of an agoraphobia situation. Agoraphobia without history of panic disorder also refers to avoidance of situations because of other bodily symptoms that are not on the list of panic attack symptoms, such as visual disturbances. A list of these symptoms is shown here. Other Physical Symptoms That Might Lead to Agoraphobia. Headaches. Tunnel vision or sensitivity to light. Muscle spasms. Urinary retention problems. Weakness. Fatigue. Diarrhea. Sensations of falling The overriding notion is that agoraphobia comes from being anxious about uncomfortable physical symptoms in certain situations. These situations are ones in which it seems difficult to cope with the uncomfortable feelings because of the feelings of being trapped or of there being no way of getting help. It is possible to be anxious about and avoid these types of situations for reasons unrelated to uncomfortable physical symptoms. For example, many people refuse to fly because of concerns about crashing or being hijacked. Or, difficulty driving can be based on concerns about being hit by other drivers. Similarly, avoidance of being alone or of leaving one\\'s safety zone can be related to concerns of being attacked, mugged, or other external dangers. This workbook is not written with these kinds of fears in mind. Instead, this workbook is for fear and avoidance behavior due to uncomfortable physical symptoms and panic attacks. 7 Medical Problems Certain medical problems can cause panic attacks, and controlling them eliminates panic attacks. These medical problems include hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland) and pheochromocytoma (a tumor on the adrenal gland, which is very rare). Other medical problems include extreme use of amphetamines (such as benzedrine, which is sometimes prescribed for asthma or weight loss) or caffeine ( or more cups of coffee per day). However, these medical problems are different from panic disorder. In panic disorder, the panic attacks are not caused by medical problems. (We recommend that those who feel that they are suffering from panic attacks undergo a full physical exam to decide whether the panic attacks are caused by these types of medical problems or whether they are part of panic disorder.) There are other medical problems that cause panic-like symptoms, but controlling these medical problems does not eliminate panic attacks. These include hypoglycemia (low blood sugar), mitral valve prolapse (flutter of the heart), asthma, allergies, and gastrointestinal problems (such as irritable bowel syndrome). It is possible to have one of these medical problems as well as panic disorder. For example, low blood-sugar levels may cause weakness and shakiness and thus lead to panic, but correction of blood-sugar levels through diet does not necessarily stop all panic attacks. In other words, these types of medical problems may be a complicating factor that exists alongside panic disorder, but removing these medical problems does not always remove panic disorder. If you have not had medical tests in the past year, it may be wise to undergo a full medical examination to check for possible physical causes of panic-like symptoms and to identify other physical conditions that might contribute to panic and anxiety. These factors can then be taken into account during the treatment program. How Common Are Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia? Panic attacks and agoraphobia are very common. The most recent large-scale surveys of the adult population of the United States show that from ? to ?% of individuals experience panic disorder and/or agoraphobia at some time in their lives. This means that somewhere between  and  million people in the United States alone suffer from panic disorder and/or agoraphobia. 8 One out of every  people suffers from panic disorder and/or agoraphobia at some time in his or her life. In addition, many people have occasional panic attacks that do not develop into panic disorder. For example, over % of the population has had a panic attack during the past year, usually in response to a stressful situation, such as an examination or a car accident. Moreover, a significant number of people experience occasional panic attacks fromout of the blue or for no real reasonestimates range from ? to % in the last year. Panic attacks and agoraphobia occur in all kinds of people, across all social and educational levels, professions, and types of persons. They are also present across different races and cultures, although panics may be described and understood differently according to specific cultural beliefs. Recognition of panic disorder in other cultures has led to the translation of this workbook into several other languages, including Chinese, Spanish, Korean, and Arabic. Unhelpful Ways of Coping With Panic Attacks We already mentioned a common way of coping with panic attacks: avoiding situations where they might occur (i.e., agoraphobia). Although avoidance of situations decreases anxiety in the short term, in the long term it contributes to anxiety. The same is true for several others ways of coping with panic attacks, including distractions, superstitious objects and safety signals, and alcohol. Avoidance In addition to avoidance of situations from which escape is difficult or help is not easily available (i.e., agoraphobia), avoidance extends to avoiding activities and other things. For example, consider the following behaviors.. Do you avoid drinking coffee?. Do you avoid medication of any kind, even if prescribed by your doctor?. Do you avoid exercise or physical exertion?. Do you avoid becoming very angry? 9. Do you avoid sexual relations?. Do you avoid watching horror movies, medical documentaries, or very sad movies?. Do you avoid being outside in very hot or very cold conditions?. Do you avoid being away from medical help?. Do you avoid being rushed? Usually, these activities are avoided because they produce symptoms that are similar to panic attack symptoms. Again, while avoidance helps relieve anxiety and panic in the short term, it contributes to anxiety in the long term. Distraction Many people attempt toget through anxious situations by distracting themselves. There is no limit to the methods used for distraction. For example, if you feel yourself becoming anxious or panicky, do you:. Play loud music?. Carry around something to read?. Pinch yourself ?. Snap an elastic band on your wrist?. Place cold, wet towels on your face?. Tell somebody who is with you to talk about something anything?. Keep as busy as possible?. Keep the television on as you go to sleep?. Imagine yourself somewhere else?. Play counting games? Chances are that these types of distractions have helped you get through a panic attack in the past and may well help you in the future. However, they can become a crutch. For example, if you forget your reading material or your elastic band, you may have to go home to get it. Also, in the long run, these strategies are not very helpful. Distraction is like placing tape around 10 a broken table leg without fixing the break. We will discuss this further in chapter ?. Superstitious Objects and Safety Signals Superstitious objects or people are specific items or persons that make one feel safe. (They are also called safety signals.) Examples include other people, food, or empty or full medication bottles. If these objects or people were not around, you would probably feel more anxious. The reality is these superstitious objects do not actuallysave you because there is really nothing to be saved from. Other superstitious objects are listed below. Superstitious Objects and Safety Signals. Food or drink. Smelling salts. Paper bags. Religious symbols. Flashlights. Money. Cameras. Bags or purses. Reading material. Cigarettes. Pets. Portable phones As with distractions, these objects become a crutch and can contribute to anxiety in the long run. Alcohol Perhaps you use a far more dangerous coping strategyalcohol. We now know that many men (moreso than women) drink to get through situations where they might have a panic attack. In fact, from one third to one 11 half of people with alcohol problems began the long road to alcohol addiction byself-medicating anxiety or panic. Using alcohol to cope with your panics and anxiety is extremely dangerous. This is because while alcohol works for a little while, you are likely to become dependent on the alcohol and require more and more of it. As you drink more and more, the anxiety-reducing properties of alcohol become less and less. Instead, anxiety and depression tend to increase. If you drink to control your anxiety, make every effort to stop as soon as possible, and ask your doctor or mental health professional for help. How Does This Program Help You Cope With Panic and Agoraphobia? Instead of relying on avoidance, distractions, superstitious objects, alcohol, or other unhelpful methods, this program is designed to educate you and to teach constructive ways of coping. This program focuses on ways of coping with panic, anxiety about panic, and avoidance of panic. The kind of treatment that is described in this program is called cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT differs from traditional psychotherapies in several important ways. Unlike traditional psychotherapies, CBT teaches skills to manage anxiety and panic. Specifically, you will be taught ways of slowing your breathing, ways of changing the way you think, and ways of facing the things that make you anxious so that they no longer bother you. For each set of skills, we begin with educational information and then outline exercises to be practiced. Then, we build on the previous practice by developing new skills. Finally, the skills are used to cope with panic and anxiety. Unlike traditional psychotherapies, you will be given homework assignments. Thus, CBT is much like attending class and continuing to learn on your own by further study between classes. In many ways, it is the selfstudy program that is the most essential to your success. Unlike traditional psychotherapies, we do not emphasize your childhood memories and experiences (unless they are directly related to your panic attacks, as might occur if witnessing someone die of a heart attack when you were a child led you to fear that you will also die of a heart attack). Instead, CBT emphasizes interruption of the factors that currently contribute to 12 your panic disorder and agoraphobia. As you will see, it is this method that has proven to be highly effective. A good beginning to CBT is education about what causes panic attacks. What Causes Panic, Anxiety, and Agoraphobia? The question of what causes panic, anxiety, and agoraphobia is very difficult, and we do not know all of the answers just yet. We will discuss the subject in more detail in chapter ?, but it is important to say several things here about the causes of panic and anxiety. Biological Factors First, the research does not suggest that panic attacks are due to a biological disease. Of course, there are the relatively rare examples mentioned above where a medical condition does cause symptoms that resemble a panic attack, such as hyperthyroidism or a tumor on the adrenal gland. However, common panic attacks do not seem to be due to biological dysfunction. Many people ask whether panic attacks are due to a chemical imbalance. Neurochemicals are substances in the central nervous system, including the brain, which are involved in sending nerve impulses. Neurochemicals that may influence panic and anxiety include noradrenalin and serotonin. While these types of substances may be present in greater amounts in the midst of anxiety and panic, there is no evidence to suggest that a neurochemical imbalance is the original or main cause of panic and anxiety. Some recent evidence usingbrain scan procedures called Positron Emission Topography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown that certain parts of the brain seem to be particularly active in anxious patients. However, it is not at all clear whether these findings are the effect of anxiety or the cause of anxiety. On the other hand, certain biological factors that may be inherited or passed on through genes may lead some people to be more likely to panic. Many believe that what is inherited are overly sensitive parts of the nervous system which lead to a tendency to experience all negative emotions, including anger, sadness, guilt, and shame, as well as anxiety and panic. However, inheriting vulnerabilities to experience negative emotions does 13 not guarantee that you will experience panic attacks or panic disorder. In other words, panic is not inherited in the same way that, say, eye color is inherited. If you inherit the genetic structure for blue eyes, then you will have blue eyes. You do not, however, inherit panic disorder in this way. People probably inherit a tendency (or a vulnerability) to panic disorder something that increases the chances of developing panic disorder but does not guarantee it. Furthermore, even with a vulnerability to panic, it is possible to think and act in ways that prevent panic attacks from recurring (which is exactly what we teach in this program). Biological factors (whatever they may be) probably help explain why panic disorder tends to run in families. In other words, if one family member has panic disorder, then another person in the same family is more likely to have panic disorder than are others in the general population. That is, whereas ??% of the U.S. population has panic disorder and/or agoraphobia,% of first-degree relatives (parents, siblings, children) of someone with panic disorder themselves develop panic disorder. Psychological Factors Psychological factors are important also. People who experience panic attacks tend to have certain beliefs that lead them to be especially afraid of physical symptoms, such as racing heart, shortness of breath, dizziness, and so on. The beliefs are that physical symptoms are harmful, either mentally, physically, or socially. Examples of such beliefs include thoughts that a racing heart could mean heart disease, that lightheadedness could mean that you are about to pass out, that a growling stomach could mean you will lose control of your bowels, that strong emotions mean that you are out of control, or that a sense of unreality means that you are losing control of your mind or going insane. The sources of these beliefs are not fully known, but personal experiences with health and illness may be one important contributor. For example, parents who are overprotective about their child\\'s physical health may contribute to a general overconcern about physical well-being in the child that gradually develops into beliefs that physical symptoms are harmful. Or, the sudden and unexpected loss of close family members to physical problems, such as heart attacks or stroke, may increase the likelihood that someone 14 believes that their own physical symptoms are harmful. Another example is to observe another family member suffer through a prolonged, serious illness. However, beliefs are not the sole cause of panic attacks. As with the biological factors described previously, beliefs that physical symptoms are harmful probably increase the likelihood of panic attacks and panic disorder but do not guarantee them. Furthermore, this type of psychological vulnerability can be offset by learning to think and act in different ways. Most likely, the vulnerability to panic is based on a complex interaction between psychological and biological factors. What we do know is that a panic attack is a surge of fear that by itself is a normal bodily response. What makes it abnormal is that it occurs at the wrong time; that is, when there is no real reason to be afraid. Again, the response itself is normal and natural, and it would be the same kind of reaction you would have if you were to face a real danger (such as being attacked by a person with a gun). In addition, it is normal and natural to become anxious about having another panic attack and to avoid places where you think that panic attacks are likely to occur, if you believe that panic attacks are harmful to you. What About Stress? For most people, their first panic attack happened when they were under a lot of stress. In addition to negative stressful events, such as job loss, stress can be positive as well, such as moving to a new home, having a baby, or getting married. This probably explains why panic attacks are more likely to begin in the s, since that is when we tend to take on new responsibilities, such as leaving home and starting new careers and relationships. During stressful periods, everyone is more tense, and even little things become harder to manage. Stress can increase overall levels of physical tension and can lower your confidence in your ability to cope with life. Additionally, having to deal with many negative life stresses can cause us to think of the world as a threatening or dangerous place. For all these reasons, a situation that may normally be very manageable becomes much more stressful when it occurs in the context of other ongoing stress. Think of a woman who has recently lost her job and whose marriage is breaking up. Within that background of stress, it may be much more difficult for her to 15 deal with traffic delays than if there were no background stress. So, as a result, stress increases the chances of panic attacks. However, stress alone is not an adequate explanation. Some people do not panic even though they are under a lot of stress. Instead, they have other reactions to stress, such as headaches, high blood pressure, or ulcers. It seems that stressful events increase the likelihood of panic attacks in people who are vulnerable or susceptible to panic. These vulnerabilities include the biological and psychological factors already described. Furthermore, stress is rarely the reason why panic attacks persist. For example, although panic attacks may have begun during a time of a lot of marital problems, they are likely to continue even after the marital problems have been resolved. This is because panic attacks and anxiety tend to take on a negative, self-maintaining cycle of their own. This set of maintenance cycles is described in detail in chapter ?. Is This Program Right for You? The following list will help you to determine whether you can benefit from this program. Consider if you have experienced any of the following.. Episodes of abrupt and extreme discomfort or fear (i.e., panic). At least some of the panic attacks include physical symptoms and fears, such as:. Shortness of breath or smothering. Heart palpitations or racing or pounding heart. Chest pain or discomfort. Trembling or shaking. Feelings of choking. Sweating. Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded or faint. Chills or hot flushes. Nausea or abdominal distress. Feelings of unreality or detachment. Numbness or tingling 16. Fears of dying. Fears of going insane or losing control. At least one panic attack was unexpected or came from out of the blue. Persistent anxiety or worry about panic attacks, their consequences, or life changes as a result of the attacks. Avoidance of different situations (such as driving, being alone, crowded areas, unfamiliar areas) or activities (such as exercise) in which you expect to panic. The panic attacks are not the direct result of physical conditions or diseases As already mentioned, panic attacks can be a part of all types of anxiety problems, such as social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), generalized anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and specific phobias. Panic attacks may also occur in mood disorders, such as depression. The distinguishing feature of panic disorder is that the panic attacks themselves become the main source of anxiety and concern. If you experience panic attacks but are not anxious about having panic attacks, and instead, you are worried about other things, then consult with your mental health professional to learn if a different treatment is more appropriate. You fit this program if your main concern is the panic attacks themselves and, of course, if the panic attacks are not the direct result of physical conditions or diseases. Are You Receiving Other Psychological Treatments? This program may be appropriate for you even if you have had contact with other mental health professionals in the past for panic and anxiety. We have used this program time and time again with people who have been through many different forms of treatment. However, some consideration must be given to other treatment that is ongoing with your participation in this program. We recommend that this program not be combined with other psychotherapy that specifically addresses your panic and anxiety. The reason for this is that messages from different treatments for the same problem can become mixed and confusing. We find it much more effective to do only one therapy for panic disorder at a time. On the other hand, if you 17 are receiving ongoing general therapy or therapy focused on a different problem area (such as marital problems), then there is no reason why you cannot participate in this program as well. If you are involved in another psychotherapy that specifically addresses your panic attacks and anxiety, we recommend that you pursue that treatment until you are sure that either it is effective (in which case, no more treatment is needed) or that it is ineffective (in which case, our program can be tried). As you will soon see, our program has been shown to be very effective for many people, but that does not mean that other psychotherapies should not be given a fair trial. Different forms of therapy are more or less effective for different people. You must make this decision if you are involved in another treatment for panic disorder and agoraphobia. To aid this decision, the National Institute for Mental Health published an official statement in  in which it was recommended that decisions about whether psychological treatments for panic disorder are beneficial or not should be made after about six weeks, when the beginnings of improvements should be evident. Furthermore, they recommended against continuing for years in psychotherapy for panic disorder when there is no evidence for improvement. Are You Taking Medications? This program will be appropriate even if you use medications to control your anxiety and panic, assuming that despite the medication, you continue to be anxious about panic attacks. We say this because medications are not always fully effective. For some people, medications are only mildly to moderately effective or not effective at all. For others, medications are effective initially, but then relapse occurs when the medication is stopped. Fortunately, medication treatments can be successfully combined with this program, and we discuss ways of achieving this in chapter . In addition, this program has been found to be helpful for persons who want to stop their medications. For those who have an interest in stopping their medications, we make some suggestions in chapter  that can be combined with direct medical supervision of the withdrawal process. It is definitely not wise to stop taking medication on your own. 18 Brief Description of the Program In this program, you will learn how to manage your panic attacks, anxiety about panic, and avoidance of panic and agoraphobia situations. The program is divided into  chapters, and several of the chapters have a number of different sections. In each chapter, you will learn specific skills. An outline of the content of each chapter is presented below. The skills build upon each other, so that in each new chapter or each new section, you will use skills that you have learned previously. The program is obviously structured, but there is room for individual tailoring. A self-assessment section at the end of each chapter or each section lets you test whether you have understood the information. If you have not, go back over the material again. This is important, because each new step is based on the previous steps. If you have understood the material presented in the chapter or chapter section, then continue to the next. In addition, homework exercises are outlined at the end of each chapter or section. Their importance cannot be emphasized enough, as the success of the program is based largely on your completing them. The pacing is somewhat up to you, but we recommend the following general pace. The first phase, called the Basics, takes one week, in which you are to read chapters ?? and the first section of chapter . These chapters provide all the necessary background information for you to begin learning specific strategies and will also get you going in terms of recording your panic and anxiety. After at least a full week of recording, you begin the Coping Skills phase that is devoted to developing your hierarchy of agoraphobia situations (chapter ?) and learning regulatory breathing (chapter ?) and thinking skills (chapter ?). The Coping Skills phase should take about three weeks. Then, the subsequent six weeks or so should be devoted to the Exposure phase, which involves repeated practice in facing agoraphobia situations (chapters ? and ?) and facing frightening physical symptoms (chapter ). The amount of time in the Exposure phase is very much dependent on the number of agoraphobia situations and the number of symptoms which cause you to feel anxious. Considerations about how to stop medication (chapter , section ?) and strategies to maintain your progress in the long term (chapter ) are covered in the last phase, Planning for the Future.

That person can provide additional information, advice, and guidance as you learn the various skills and conduct the different exercises. Furthermore, your doctor or mental health professional can help to tailor the program to your own needs. For the period of time that you give to this program, it must become a priority. Just as up until this time, fear has been your major focus, achieving mastery of your anxiety and panic should now be your major focus. What Benefits Will You Receive From This Program? What should you expect to get out of this program? This information is important in your decision to participate in our program. Research that we have conducted over the last  years shows this treatment to be very successful. The percentage of people who report that they are free of panic at the completion of a program similar to this one is%. This rate of success has been replicated by other researchers around the world who have tested treatments similar to this one. What is even more exciting is that these results seem to persist over long periods of timeup to  months after treatment, which is the longest period we have examined. One of the reasons for this long-term benefit is that the treatment is essentially a learning program. When something is learned, it becomes a natural part of your reactions and therefore is carried with you even after the formal program 22 has been completed. You may have ups and downs, but by completing this program, you will be able to handle the downs much more effectively and return to normal functioning more easily. On the basis of results obtained as early as , the National Institute of Mental Health came out with an official statement recognizing that the treatments of choice for panic disorder are either this type of program (CBT) and/or medication therapy. Obviously, there is never a guarantee that this treatment will be the one for you or that you may never panic again, but from the success rates, it would seem that this program is worth trying. These numbers refer to the success with which panic attacks are controlled. Remember that many people who panic develop agoraphobia as well. Treatment programs focused on agoraphobia per se produce significant improvements in% of our patients. Again, this rate of improvement is maintainedand, in fact, improvement usually continuesup to two years after treatment completion. (Again, this is the longest duration that we have evaluated.) What Is the Cost? Knowing how effective these programs are, the question for you becomes,What is the cost? Mainly, the cost is time and effort over the next weeks. One (and perhaps the only) factor known to predict the effectiveness of this program is the amount of practice that is conducted. The more you put in, the more you will get out of the program. It is not the severity of your panic and avoidance, how long you have been panicking, or how old you are that predicts success; rather, it is your motivation to learn to change. Do you have the motivation at this time to give it your best shot? One point to keep in mind is that you are probably putting out as much energy and effort into trying to manage your life with panic and anxiety as you would by going through this program. But the big plus from this program is that the energy and effort result in positive changes. If you really do not have the motivation right now, then it is better to wait, because you will be defeating yourself by beginning a program like this halfheartedly. Finally, even if your fear and anxiety diminish quickly as you proceed through the program, we recommend that you finish the program. It will 23 prove more effective in the long run to complete the entire program, in the same way that it is more effective to complete a prescription of an antibiotic even if bacterial symptoms clear up early on.

T F 25  ~ If ..\\' W.~ .r!~ Learning to Record Panic andAnxiety t\\' t; l i\\' Goals To learn the importance of record-keeping To learn ways to record panic, anxiety, and other moods Record-Keeping This chapter presents the importance and method of record-keeping. For the rest of the time that you are involved with this program, you are asked to keep ongoing records of your panic and anxiety, among other things. Record-keeping is necessary to the success of this program. Why Take the Time to Record? I Know I Am Anxious! There are many reasons why it is important to keep records of your anxiety on a regular, ongoing basis. First, panic attacks, particularly those that seem to occur for no real reason, make people feel as if they are out of control and victims of their own anxiety. Learning to be an observer as opposed to a victim of your own anxiety is a first step toward gaining control. Through record-keeping, you will learn to observe when, where, and under what circumstances your panic and anxiety occur. You will learn whether your panic attacks occur when you are alone or with others, after a stressful day at work or on weekends, in the middle of the day or at the end of the day; whether your panic attacks are brought on by feelings of excitement from watching a sports event on television, feeling overheated by a crowded shopping area, feeling suffocation from a steamy shower, thinking about horrible things that could happen, or by relaxing and having nothing else to do but dwell on your fears. Again, gaining an 27 understanding of the factors that cause your panic and anxiety to escalate will lead you to feel more in control and like less of a victim. Second, you will learn to understand the way in which you experience panic and anxiety, in terms of what you think, what you feel, and what you do. This is vety important, because this program is designed specifically to change anxious thinking, anxious feelings, and anxious behaviors. They cannot be changed without knowing exactly what they are. Third, ongoing record-keeping provides much more accurate information than you get by just asking yourself, \"How have I been feeling lately?\" If you were asked to describe the last week, you may judge it to have been \"very bad\" when, in fact, there may have been several times when you felt relatively calm. When anxiety is on your mind so much, it is easy to forget about the times when you were not anxious. As you can probably see, thinking about the previous week as \"very bad\" and overlooking relatively \"okay\" times during the week are likely to make you feel worse and more anxious. In fact, such negative judgments about how you have been doing in general may contribute to ongoing anxiety. By keeping ongoing records, you will not only feel more in control but also feel less anxious by being forced to recognize that your mood state fluctuates and that there are times when you feel less anxious than other times. Finally, recording helps you to evaluate progress. For this reason, we recommend that you continuously record throughout the entire program. Continuous recording will let you appreciate the gains you make and will help to prevent occasional panic attacks from overshadowing the progress you have made. Let us review all of the benefits of ongoing recording, as well as the reasons why it is crucial to this program: to help you feel more in control, by being able to identify when and where panic attacks are more likely to happen; identify the specific ways in which you experience anxiety; your physical feelings, your thoughts, and your behaviors; to be able to judge your level of anxiety and panic more accurately; to evaluate the success of your attempts to change. 28 What Is Objective Recording? Sometimes, people are concerned that by continually recording their panic and anxiety, they will be reminded of how anxious they feel, which in turn will make them feel even more anxious. To address this concern, it is important to distinguish between two ways of recording: subjective recording and objective recording. Subjective recording means recording \"how bad you feel,\" how terrible the panic attacks are, how much they interfere with your life, or how you cannot control them. Examples include statements such as \"I don\\'t feel well, I could panic today; what if I get so dizzy that I have to go home?\" Or, \"I am really anxious. I wish these feelings would go away. What if they get worse?\" This type of subjective recording tends to increase anxiety. Subjective recording is likely to be something that you already do and, at the same time, may be something that you try to avoid because it worsens your overall anxiety. Objective recording, which is the technique that you will be learning in this chapter, means recording the features of panic and anxiety in a concrete and nonjudgmental way. You will learn to record things such as the number or intensity of symptoms, the triggers of your panic, your thoughts, and your behavioral responses to panic. At first, it may be difficult to switch from subjective to objective recording, and as you start to use the records, you may indeed notice an increase in your anxiety because you are focusing on your feelings in the old, subjective way. However, with practice, most people are able to shift to the objective mode. To help you do this, we have developed very specific forms on which very specific objective information is to be recorded. These will be described soon. What Do I Record? Panic Atlacks You will record your panic attacks using the Panic Attack Record shown here. You may photocopy the form from this book or download multiple copies from the Treatments ThatW0rkTM website (http://www.oup.com/ 29 100 Panic Attacks -=-.../1 O-r,,-,-.-,-~- o 10 20 30 40 50 60 Time (Minutes) 100 I Panic Attacks ..e..... t tI) O-r-,-,-,,-,.,-o 10 20 30 40 50 60 Time (Minutes) 100 r-__ ~Anxiety Panic Arrack O-t,,,-.-;r-.-o 10 20 30 40 50 60 Time (Minutes) Figure 2.1. Progression of Panic and Anxiety Over Time us/trw). Use this form whenever you experience a panic attack or a sudden rush of fear. Remember, panic is different from anxiety. Panic attacks are sudden rushes of fear, and they can happen when you are fully relaxed or when you are already anxious. Panic attacks peak quickly and then decrease within 10-30 minutes, although you may continue to feel some of the symptoms and to feel generally anxious for quite a while afterward. This is called residual anxiety. You may even panic again in the midst of the residual anxiety. (See Figure 2.1.) 30 In contrast, anxiety builds more slowly. At times, anxiety may be very intense and severe, as it would be before a surgery or while waiting for the results of a test. Anxiety is best described as worrying about something in the future, even if the future is only an hour away. Panic, on the other hand, is a rush of fear with thoughts of immediate catastrophe (e.g., \"I am dying\"). Do not wait until the end of the day to complete the Panic Attack Record, as you will lose the value of recording. Complete it as soon as possible after you panic. Of course, some circumstances, such as driving or talking in a meeting, make it hard to fill out the Panic Attack Record, but complete it as soon as possible. On the Panic Attack Record, write down the date and the time that the panic attack began, and also note the triggers that seemed to bring on the panic attack. Triggers could include a stressful situation, an anxious thought, or an uncomfortable physical symptom. Even if you do not know what brought on your panic attack, list the thing that you noticed just before you panicked. You will also record whether the panic was unexpected or \"out of the blue,\" as well as the maximum level of fear you experienced during the panic attack. Use a 1O-point scale, where 0 = no fear, 5 = moderate fear, and 10 = extreme fear. You should also record each symptom that was present to at least a mild degree, your thoughts about what might happen, and your behaviors or what you did in response to the panic. Examples of Panic Attack Records completed by Jill are shown here. Jill is 29 years old, married, and has one child. She began to panic one year ago, when her child was a few months old. Since then, she has been afraid to stay home alone with her baby and often spends the day at her mother\\'s place, while her husband is at work. From Jill\\'s first record, it can be seen that this panic occurred at 5:20 p.m. on February r6. She panicked while she was alone at home, waiting for her husband to return from work. She noted that the panic was brought on because she was home alone and felt short of breath. It was an expected panic; Jill was not surprised that she panicked because being home alone is a stressful situation for her. Her maximum fear rating was an 8, which is strong. Symptoms included racing heart, difficulty breathing, sweating, trembling and shaking, feelings of unreality, and a fear of losing control or going insane. Her thoughts were that she would lose control or go insane, and her behavioral response was to call her mother. 31 Panic Attack Record Date: Time began: Triggers: Expected: Unexpected: Maximum Fear ?- ? - ? - ? - None Mild Moderate Strong Extreme Check all symptoms present to at least a mild degree: Chest pain or discomfort Sweating Heart racing/palpitations/pounding Nausea/upset stomach Shortness of breath Dizzy/unsteady/lightheaded/faint Shaking/trembling Chills/hot flushes Numbness/tingling Feelings of unreality Feelings of choking Fear of dying Fear of losing control/going insane Thoughts: Behaviors: Panic Attack Record Date: Z(1b(fXJ Time began: ~=-+\\'~ _ Triggers: \\'-\"=\",,,-~\",,,-=.2!C~~2L:~.J-_~C\".\\'J~ m __~ - _ Expected: _-\\'X\\'-\\'__ Unexpected: _ _ m .._ Maximum Fear 0- I 2 3 u_ 4 u 5u 6 -7 8- 9 10 None Mild Moderate Strong Extreme Check all symptoms present to at least a mild degree: Chest pain or discomfort Sweating Heart racing/palpitations/pounding Nausea/upset stomach Shortness of breath Dizzy/unsteady/lightheaded/faint Shakingltrembling Chills/hot flushes Numbnessltingling Feelings of unreality Feelings of choking Fear of dying Fear of losing control/going insane m~ Thoughts: ..I ...~\"\"!>f<!!\\'Jfr\\'\\\\::!..~\\'\\'\\'\\'f.-!...J:.Y:.!l.!~~~.\\'...\\'.\\'\\'\\'c.... .mm - mm.

Jill\\'s Panic Attack Record (2) 34 Anxiety and Other Moods As shown in her second record, Jill\\'s panic attack happened at 3:00 a.m. on February 19. This panic woke her out of sleep. In fact, the racing of her heart seemed to wake her out of sleep, so she listed racing heart as the trigger. The attack was unexpected. It took her by surprise. Her maximum fear was 7. Her symptoms included racing heart, breathing symptoms, sweating, shaking, and fears of dying. Her thoughts were that she would die, and her behavior was to wake her husband. You can keep a record of your general feelings throughout the day as well, by completing a Daily Mood Record at the end ofeach day. You may photocopy the form from this book or download multiple copies at the Treatments ThatWork website (http://www.oup.com/uslttw). Use a IO-point scale to rate your daily levels of anxiety, depression (i.e., how sad, down, or lacking in energy you are), and how much you worry about having a panic attack (i.e., how much is panic on your mind, how concerned are you with the possibility of panicking). For all ratings, 0 = none, 5 moderate, and 10 = extreme anxiety, depression, and worry about panic. These ratings are based on how you felt on average during the day. In other words, considering the whole day, and combining all ups and downs throughout the day together, what was your average amount of anxiety, depression, and worry about panic? Jill\\'s Daily Mood Record shows that over the course of the week, her patterns of anxiety, depression, and worry about panic changed. On February 16 and 17, Jill was quite worried about having a panic attack; these were the first twO days after a weekend spent with her husband. Notice how she was also generally more anxious and depressed on those days compared to other days. In contrast, on February 21 and 22 (the weekend), she felt less anxious, less depressed, and less worried about panicking because her husband was with her the whole time. Over the course of several weeks, trends often become evident. One example is the way in which moods fluctuate in relation to the frequency of panic attacks. It will be important to learn this information to make your treatment as effective as possible. 35 Daily Mood Record for Jill Rate each column at the end of the day, using a number from the o-IO-point scale below.

Of course, you may also record your progress in other areas as well, such as worry about panic or level ofdepressed mood. This Progress Record will allow you to see how you are doing and to put things into perspective. It is helpful to keep this in a visible place, such as your bathroom mirror or on the refrigerator. You may photocopy the form from this book or download multiple copies at the Treatments ThatWorkTM website (http://www.oup.com/uslttw). 36 Summary We cannot emphasize enough the importance of recording. It must be done daily to get the full benefit from this program. While at first you may have to push yourself to record, it will become easier and even rewarding as time goes on. It helps to give yourself feedback, and it is also beneficial for your mental health professional if you provide this kind of information. These records will be invaluable during the rest of the program, so it is definitely worth the effort. 37 Rate each column at the end of the day, using a number from the ?-point scale below. ?- ? - ? - ? - None Mild Moderate Strong Extreme Average Average Average Worry Date Anxiety Depression About Panic Daily Mood Record Homework ?

Anxiety is the reaction that we all have whenever we think something bad or threatening could happen. This could include physical threats, such as the possibility of illness, accident, or death; social threats, such as the possibility of embarrassment, rejection, or ridicule; or mental threats, such as the possibility of going insane, losing control, or losing one\\'s mental faculties. The threats could be large (such as the possibility of losing one\\'s life) or small (such as the possibility of being late for an appointment). Anxiety is our way of preparing to meet the challenge posed by these threats. It helps to gear us up and protect us from whatever is threatening. Anxiety is not bad in and of itself, and it can be a productive, driving force. Years of research have shown that having some anxiety enhances performance. That is, you do better at what you are doing, whether in the classroom or on the job, when anxiety is present up to a certain level. Imagine absolutely no anxiety about a job interview-you would be less motivated to put your best foot forward to meet the challenge of getting the job. However, anxiety can vary in severity, from mild uneasiness to extreme dis41 Good Difficult Tasks ~ Poor Low Moderate High Level ofArousal Figure 3.1. Yerkes-Dodson Law tress. At the extreme end, anxiety can interfere with what you are doing. Imagine extreme anxiety in a job interview which leads to poor concentration and stammering. The notion that some anxiety is helpful for learning and performance, whereas too much anxiety can interfere with learning and performance, is shown above in the standard diagram of the YerkesDodson Law. Anxiety can vary in frequency, from occasional episodes to seemingly constant unease. When anxiety is very frequent, it can interfere with daily life. The goals of this program are to decrease the likelihood of becoming anxious unnecessarily and to decrease the intensity of anxiety so that you can function normally. The goal, however, is not to remove anxiety altogether. How does this discussion relate to panic disorder? In the case of panic disorder, anxiety is experienced because of the \"threat\" of panic. As described in more detail in the next chapter, panic is regarded as threatening because of beliefs that panic could cause you to die, lose control, or go insane. As you will see, these beliefs are incorrect. Anxiety about the threat of panicking is unnecessary because panic attacks actually are not harmful. The Parts to Anxiety and Panic There are three major parts to panic and anxiety: physical symptoms, thoughts, and behaviors. The physical part involves the symptoms of rapid heartbeat, difficulty breathing, nervous stomach, diarrhea, sweating, shak42 ing, headaches, stomachaches, a lump in the throat, frequent urination, fatigue, restlessness, visual disturbances, a sense of pressure in the head, and many more. The physical symptoms can be acute, lasting a short period of time (as in panic attacks), or can be prolonged, lasting hours or days (as in general anxiety). Also, the acute physical symptoms can shift from one panic attack to the next. On one occasion, you may notice strong symptoms of shortness of breath, while on another occasion you may instead notice a racing and pounding heart. The thoughts are beliefs, or things that we say to ourselves, or images of impending doom or of something terrible that is about to happen. We refer to these as negative thoughts. Most often, thoughts during panic attacks are about immediate physical catastrophes (such as fainting, dying, heart attack, brain tumor), social catastrophes (such as ridicule or jeering), or mental catastrophes (such as going insane or losing control). Thoughts during anxiety are about bad things that could happen in the fUture, such as job loss or the worst panic attack ever. The behaviors are things we do, such as pacing up and down, fidgeting, or escaping from or avoiding places where anxiety and panic are expected to occur. An example of escaping is to leave a shopping mall as soon as feelings of anxiety or panic develop. An example of avoiding is to not enter a shopping mall at all because of concerns about panicking once inside. Other behaviors include looking for exits or ways out of situations, relying on objects that make you feel better (these are the superstitious objects we described in chapter I), or seeking help (such as at medical centers). These three parts often differ from times when you are anxious to times when you panic. Thoughts during anxiety usually have to do with the future (e.g., \"My boss could give me a negative evaluation at the end of the year,\" or, \"It would be horrible if 1 panicked at the party tomorrow\"), whereas thoughts during panic attacks are usually about the immediate situation (e.g., \"I am going to faint right now,\" or, \"I must be crazy\"). Also, anxious behaviors include avoiding situations or extra cautiousness (such as mapping out directions fully in advance), whereas behaviors during panic have more to do with escaping or finding help. Finally, physical symptoms during anxiety usually are long lasting and involve muscle tension, restlessness, and fatigue; whereas panic attack symptoms are more abrupt and tend to decrease more quickly than the physical symptoms of anxiety, and include heart palpitations, shortness of breath, and other symptoms listed in the table in chapter 1. 43 Your Own Physical Symptoms. Behaviors, and Thoughts Think about your own thoughts, symptoms, and behaviors when you are in the midst of a panic attack, and consider your own thoughts, symptoms, and behaviors when you are generally anxious (such as when you are worrying about having a panic attack in the future). Remember Jill? During her panic attacks, her most common symptoms were a racing heart, shortness of breath, and feelings of unreality and numbness; her most common thoughts were that she would lose control or go insane; and her most common behaviors were to leave wherever she was and find either her husband or her mother. In contrast, when she worried about panic attacks in the future, her thoughts varied based on whatever she was worrying about; her most common symptoms were an upset stomach, muscle tension, and fatigue; and her most common behaviors consisted of biting her nails and seeking reassurance from her husband that everything would be okay. On the Pans of Panic and the Parts of Anxiety forms provided on pages 45 and 46, record what you typically think, what you physically feel, and what you do when you panic and when you feel anxious. You may photocopy these forms from the book or download multiple copies at the Treatments ThatWork website (http://www.oup.com/us/ttw). The Panic Cycle Physical symptoms, thoughts, and behaviors contribute to each other in what is called a negative cycle. In other words, they tend to snowball offeach other. For example, negative thoughts can directly increase physical symptoms. If we tell ourselves that something dangerous is about to occur (e.g., \"I am about to have a heart attack\"), then physical tension will increase because our bodies pump out more adrenalin and operate at faster rates whenever we face danger. In turn, a physical symptom, such as a racing heart, may lead to more negative thoughts. This is particularly likely if you believe that normal symptoms of tension are dangerous (e.g., \"The fact that my heart rate has not slowed down must surely mean that something is terribly wrong\"), Behaviors of fidgeting, pacing, and escaping a situation can increase levels of physical tension as well because of the physical effort they involve.  _ - 44 Parts of Panic Physical Symptoms ?. ?. ?.

Physical symptoms Negative thoughts of racing heart of heart attack Escape from situation to find medical help Figure 3.2. The Panic Cycle More specifically, the thought that a racing heart is a sign of heart disease is frightening and will produce more raciness of the heart. In turn, the continued raciness may lead to stronger beliefs that something is terribly wrong with the heart. It may also lead to attempts to get medical help. Such negative thoughts and behaviors may again prolong the racing of the heart. In other words, negative thoughts lead to fear, and fear leads to more physical symptoms and escape behaviors that snowball into more negative thoughts, and so on. The end result is intense fear or panic, as is shown in Figure 3.2. This is called a panic cycle. Another example is to think that shortness of breath means that you are about to suffocate. That thought will cause more physical tension and more symptoms of shortness of breath, as well as attempts to breath more deeply, which in turn may contribute to shortness of breath (for reasons described later), and so on. In contrast, thinking that a racing heart is harmless and not reason for concern will interrupt this negative cycle, with the end result that panic does not occur. This is shown in Figure 3.3. Similarly, realizing that shortness of breath is not a sign of impending suffocation will offset the chances of a panic attack. Think about a recent panic attack and the physical symptoms, negative thoughts and behaviors, and the ways in which they contributed to each other. What was the first thing that happened? Was it a physical symptom or a thought? What happened next? Did your physical symptoms increase, and what did that lead you to think? How did you behave? How did your reactions influence your physical symptoms? An example of this kind of step-by-step analysis is provided in the next section. ....... __..~- 47 l Physical symptoms r Thoughts that of racing heart l \"It is harmless\" I Continue with usual activities ~!

My reaction was to hold onto the chair [behavior}. I thought something was wrong [negative thought}. I thought it couldget worse and worse and that I wouldftint and collapse [negative thought}. By then, I wasfeeling very nervous. As the dizziness got worse and worse [physical symptom}, I became really concerned, because it was diffirentfom any other experience I had ever had I was convinced that this was \"it\"-that I was going to collapse and that nobody wouldfind me [negative thought}.

Use the Step-by-Step Panic Analysis of Panic Attack form (on page 50) to understand one of your own recent panic attacks. You may photocopy the form from this book or download multiple copies from the Treatments ThatWork website (http://www.oup.com/us/ttw). By understanding these cycles (from negative thoughts, to physical symptoms, to behaviors, to more negative thoughts and more physical symptoms, and so on), you will develop a good awareness ofwhat causes panic attacks. These records will also help you to understand that the way to interrupt these cycles is to change the way you think about and respond to physical symptoms. Agoraphobia Cycle If you are anxious about physical symptoms, it is likely that you are especially watchful for those symptoms as you enter a situation from which escape is not easy or in which help is not available. For example, you might be particularly attentive to dizziness as you drive on an unfamiliar road. If you become afraid of the symptom in that situation, then it is understandable how you might feel panicky or that you would attempt to find an exit. However, by escaping the situation, you may feel even more anxiety the next time you attempt to enter that situation, and you may feel even less likely to enter the situation in the future. That is, the fear has been reinforced because you did not learn that it was safe to continue in the situation, despite the physical symptoms. This sequence of events is shown in Figure 3.4. Interrupting Panic and Agoraphobia Cycles This program teaches you ways of interrupting the panic and agoraphobia cycles. It consists of strategies to help you think differently about and to behave differently toward physical symptoms. It teaches you how to no longer be panicked by physical symptoms and to no longer avoid physical symptoms or the situations in which they are expected to occur. 49 Step-by-Step Analysis of Panic Attack Where were you and what was going on when the panic attack first started? What happened first? A physical symptom, negative thought, or a behavior? What happened next? How did you react to the first physical symptom or negative thought? Did you notice more physical symptoms, more negative thoughts, or did you do something, such as seek help, lie down, or exit wherever you were? What happened next? Did the physical symptoms get worse, did you become even more scared about negative things happening? What was next? How did it end? Anxiety about facing a \"trapped/unsafe\" situation t Increased attention to physical symptoms on entering the situation t Mistaken belief that the physical symptoms ~ are harmful or unmanageable II ~ Tension and attention intensifY symptoms that, in turn, intensifY fear t Attempt~~or actual escape from the Situation); t Increased anxiety and avoidance of the situation in the future Figure 3.4. The Agoraphobia Cycle You will be taught two coping skills. The first strategy is breathing skills. Breathing skills are designed to regulate breathing and interrupt the panic and agoraphobia cycles by providing a tool for you to continue in whatever activity you are engaging and face your fear rather than avoid it. The second coping skill is directed at your negative thoughts. Once you are able to discover exactly what negative thoughts you have, you will learn to treat them as guesses rather than facts. You will develop alternative ways of thinking that are more based on evidence than conjecture. You will use these two coping skills to help deal with the situations that you have been avoiding because of anticipation of panic attacks (i.e, agoraphobia). You will learn to be less afraid of these situations and to realize that they are harmless. In addition, you will use the coping skills to deal directly 51 with physical symptoms that make you anxious, such as shortness of breath, dizziness, or palpitations. You will learn to be less afraid of those symptoms and to realize that they are harmless. You will learn how to deal directly with the physical symptoms when they occur in agoraphobia situations. Everything you learn in this treatment must be put into practice over and over again until it becomes part of your natural method of responding.

T F -_ ~ 52 Panic Attacks Are Not Harmful Goals To learn about the causes of the physical symptoms of panic To learn that the physical symptoms of panic are not harmful To understand why panic attacks seem to come from \"out of the blue\" Physical Symptoms of Panic and Survival of the Fittest Because negative thoughts contribute to panic, and because the negative thoughts often have to do with believing that the physical symptoms are harmful, it is important to have an accurate understanding of the physical symptoms of panic. This information will help you realize that the physical symptoms of panic are not harmful. Scientifically, immediate or short-term fear (i.e., a panic attack) is named the fightl\\'ight response. The effects of this response are aimed toward either fighting with or fleeing from danger. The number-one purpose of panic is to protect us from danger. When our ancestors lived in caves, it was vital that when faced with danger, an automatic response would take over, causing them to take immediate action (attack or run). Even in today\\'s hectic world, this is a necessary mechanism. Just imagine if you were crossing a street when suddenly a car sped toward you blasting its horn. If you experienced absolutely no fear, you would be killed. What actually happens is that your fight-flight response takes over, and you run out of the way. The purpose of panic is to protect us, not to harm us. It is our survival mechanism, and it involves the following physical changes in our bodies. Nervous and Chemical Effects When danger is detected, the brain sends messages to a section of your nerves called the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system has two subsections, or branches, called the sympathetic nervous system and 53 the parasympathetic nervous system. These two branches of the nervous system are directly involved in controlling your body\\'s energy levels and its preparation for action. The sympathetic nervous system is the fight-flight system, which releases energy and gets the body ready for action (fighting or fleeing).The parasympathetic nervous system is the restoring system, which returns the body to a normal state. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system is believed to cause most panic attack symptoms. The sympathetic nervous system tends to be an all-or-none system. When it is activated, all of its parts respond. This may explain why most panic attacks involve many physical symptoms and not just one or two. In addition, the sympathetic nervous system responds immediately, as soon as danger is close at hand (e.g., think of the rush that you experience when you think another car on the freeway is about to hit you). That is why the physical symptoms of panic attacks can occur almost instantaneously, within seconds. The sympathetic nervous system releases two chemicals, adrenalin and noradrenalin, from the adrenal glands on the kidneys. These chemicals are used as messengers by the sympathetic nervous system to continue activity so that once activity begins, it often continues and increases for some time. However, the sympathetic nervous system activity is stopped in two ways. First, the chemical messengers adrenalin and noradrenalin are eventually destroyed by other chemicals in the body. Second, the parasympathetic nervous system (which generally has opposing effects to the sympathetic nervous system) becomes activated and restores a relaxed feeling. Eventually, the body will \"have enough\" of the fight-flight response, and the parasympathetic nervous system will restore a relaxed feeling. In other words, panic can neither continue forever nor spiral to ever-increasing and damaging levels. The parasympathetic nervous system stops the sympathetic nervous system from getting \"carried away.\" Adrenalin and noradrenalin take some time to be fully destroyed. Even after your sympathetic nervous system has stopped responding, you are likely to feel \"keyed up\" or \"on edge\" for some time because the chemicals are still Roating around in your system. This is perfectly natural and harmless. In fact, there is a purpose to this-in the wild, danger often has a habit of returning. So, it is useful for us to remain in a \"keyed-up\" state so that we can quickly reactivate the fight-flight response if danger returns. 54 Cardiovascular Effects Each physical effect of the fight-flight system is intended to prepare you to fight or flee-that is, to protect you. The fight-flight system affects our hearts, blood flow, breathing, sweating, pupils, muscles, and digestive system, as well as other parts of our body. Activity in the sympathetic nervous system increases heart rate and the strength of the heartbeat. This is vital to preparation for action (to fight or flee) because it speeds up the blood flow, improving delivery of oxygen to the tissues and removal of waste products from the tissues. The muscle tissues need oxygen as a source of energy for fighting or fleeing. This is why a racing or pounding heart is typically experienced during periods of high . . anXiety or pamc. Also, there is a change in the blood flow. Basically, blood is taken away from the places where it is not needed (by a tightening of the blood vessels) and is directed toward the places where it is needed more (by an expansion of the blood vessels). For example, blood is taken away from the skin, fingers, and toes. This is useful because, thinking back to our ancestral cave days, the extremities are the most likely place to be attacked and injured. Having less blood flow there means that we are less likely to bleed to death. As a result, the skin looks pale and feels cold, especially around the hands and feet. Instead, the blood goes to the large muscles, such as the thighs, heart, and biceps, which need the oxygen for fighting or fleeing. The big muscles are most important for running or fighting. Together, these physical changes cause the heart to race or pound and the skin to feel pale and cold, especially around the toes and fingers, sometimes causing feelings of weakness in the hands and feet. You might feel cold even though it is a warm day. These are normal physical feelings under conditions of being afraid or anxious. It is a sign that the body is preparing to take action. Sometimes, people report feeling hot instead of cold. Hot feelings are more likely to occur during the abrupt rush of panic, as soon as the sympathetic nervous system is activated and before the blood flow is redirected. The cold chills that go along with the redirection of the blood flow are more likely to occur with slow-building or longer-lasting anxiety. 55 Respiration Effects Sweat-Gland Effects Other Physical Effects Another effect is for breathing to become faster and deeper, because the body needs more oxygen to be able to fight or flee. Sometimes, breathing can become unbalanced and cause harmless but unpleasant symptoms such as breathlessness, choking or smothering feelings, and pain or tightness in the chest. Also, the blood supply to the head may be decreased. While this is only a small amount and is not at all dangerous, it produces unpleasant (but harmless) symptoms, including dizziness, blurred vision, confusion, feelings of unreality (or, feeling as if you are in a dream state), and hot flushes. These physical symptoms might be uncomfortable but are not at all harmful and are not a sign that something is seriously wrong with you. The fight-flight response increases sweating. Sweating cools the body to prevent it from overheating and allows you to continue fighting or fleeing from danger without collapsing from heat. In addition, excessive sweating makes the skin slippery, so that it is more difficult for a predator to grasp. Perspiration is a common symptom of anxiety and panic. Also, the pupils (the center of the eyes) widen to let in more light. This helps us to scan the environment for whatever is dangerous. Remember, panic and anxiety are reactions to the perception of threat, and if a threat or danger is expected to occur, then it makes sense for us to be on guard and looking for it by increasing our field of vision. At the same time, the change in the pupils may cause symptoms such as blurred vision, spots in front of the eyes, or sensitivity to bright lights. Another physical effect is a decrease in salivation, resulting in a dry mouth. In fact, the whole digestive system is decreased, so that energy that is required for food digestion can be redirected to the muscles that are needed to fight or flee. This often causes nausea, heavy feelings in the stomach, and sometimes diarrhea as material that could \"weigh us down\" while attempting to fight or flee is evacuated from the body. 56 Also, many of the muscle groups tense up in preparation for fight or flight, and this results in feelings of tension. This tension can sometimes cause aches and pains, as well as trembling and shaking. Another interesting effect is the release of natural analgesics (i.e., painkillers) from the brain, so that we are less likely to feel pain when we are afraid. The purpose of this is to enable you to continue fighting or fleeing from danger even if you have been injured. Connected with this is the release of coagulants and lymphocytes into the blood which helps to seal wounds and repair tissue damage. In addition, there is a contraction of the spleen, so that more red blood cells are released to carry more oxygen around the blood, and there is a release of stored sugar from the liver, so that the muscles have more sugar available as a source of energy. Finally, because the fight-flight response produces a general activation of the whole body, and because this takes a lot of energy, people generally feel tired, drained, and \"washed out\" afterward. In summary, the physical changes that underlie the physical symptoms of panic and anxiety are protective in that they are designed to help us escape from or fight off danger. The symptoms are real, but they are not harmful. Interestingly, physical symptoms are sometimes felt in the absence of actual physical changes. For example, sometimes people feel as if the heart is racing when, in fact, it is beating at a normal pace. Or, sometimes people feel hot, even though their skin temperature has not changed. This occurs because an intense and anxious focus on physical feelings can create the perception of a physical disturbance even when none really exists. However, intense panic attacks are almost always based on real physical changes. These are summarized in Table 4-1. How Do Physical Symptoms Influence What We Think and Do? When the sympathetic nervous system is activated into an emergency fight-flight response, there are certain natural effects on our behaviors and our thoughts. (Remember, anxiety and panic are made up of physical symptoms, thoughts, and behaviors.) 57 Table 4.1.

The Behavior of Fight-Flight Response The emergency fight-flight response prepares the body to either attack or run. It is no surprise that the overwhelming urge to escape is associated with panic. Sometimes, escape is not possible, such as when you are in church in the middle of the pew or at an important meeting. At these times, the urge to escape may become stronger or be shown through such behaviors as foot tapping, pacing, or snapping at people. The Thoughts of Fight-Flight The number-one effect of the emergency fight-flight response on our thinking is to alert us to the possibility of danger. One of the major effects is an immediate shift in attention to search for a potential threat-we stop attending to ongoing chores and scan our surroundings for danger. 58 If There Is Nothing to Be Afraid of, Why Panic? It is understandable to have the fight-flight response if we are attacked, trapped in an elevator, or experiencing any other major stress. But why does the fight-flight response occur where there is nothing to be frightened of, when there is no obvious danger? Remember, a panic attack is a normal bodily response to fear. What makes it abnormal is when it occurs at the wrong time, when there is no real danger. It appears that people with panic attacks are frightened of the physical symptoms of fear. Panic attacks represent \"anxiety about fear.\" A panic attack follows a typical sequence. First, unexpected physical symptoms are experienced. (They are unexpected because they cannot be explained by any real danger at that moment.) Second, those physical symptoms provoke anxiety and fear. Reasons for Unexpected Physical Symptoms Why do you have the physical symptoms in the first place? There are many possible reasons for this. One is stress, including stress from work pressures, rushing to appointments, relationships, and so forth, which leads to an increase in the production of adrenalin and other stress-related chemicals. This is your body\\'s way of staying alert and prepared to deal with the stress. However, these stress effects will cause physical symptoms. A second reason is being anxious about having another panic attack. Anxious anticipation of anything contributes to higher levels of physical tension and more physical symptoms of stress. Also, anxiety causes us to focus our attention on whatever it is that we are anxious about. For example, anticipating social rejection leads to an intense focus on facial expressions as we look for signs of rejection. In the case of anxiety about panic, this means that attention becomes focused on physical symptoms. You may find yourself scanning your body for unusual physical symptoms and detecting symptoms that you might not have otherwise noticed. Anxiety about having panic attacks causes more symptoms of panic and more attention to those symptoms. Consequently, anxiety about panic causes more of the very things (i.e., the physical symptoms) that the person with panic disorder is afraid of and, therefore, more panic attacks. 59 A third reason is that normal physical symptoms happen to everyone, because our bodies are constantly changing: heart rate, skin temperature, and blood flow fluctuate greatly throughout the typical 24-hour day. Effects of Being Afraid of Physical Symptoms As discussed earlier, the emergency fight-flight response causes the brain to search for danger. Sometimes, an obvious threat cannot be found, as is usually the case for panic attacks that seem to occur for no reason. However, most of us cannot accept having no explanation. When an explanation cannot be found, the search may be turned inward. In other words, \"if there is nothing to explain my feelings of panic and anxiety, then there must be something wrong with me.\" Then, the brain invents an explanation, such as: \"I must be dying, losing control, or going insane.\" As we have seen, nothing could be further from the truth, since the purpose of the fightflight response is to protect and not to harm us. These types of negative thoughts about the physical symptoms of panic only contribute in a negative cycle to more negative thoughts, physical symptoms, and behaviors of panic. This was described in chapter 3 as the panic cycle. The negative thoughts intensify the fight-flight response because the body reacts with an impulse to fight or flee when danger (in this case, the possibilities of dying, losing control, or going insane) arises. This is true even if the danger is based on a perception of what could happen-it does not have to be a real danger. As long as we think that we are in danger, our bodies will react accordingly. As a result, the very thing that is feared (i.e., the physical symptom) is intensified. That is, a physical symptom is experienced, the physical symptom is feared (because it is judged to be dangerous), and as a result, the physical symptom intensifies. This lasts until the cycle is ended by either physical compensations, which slow everything down (i.e., parasympathetic activation), or by realizing that you no longer need to be afraid of the physical symptom. In summary, physical symptoms are feared because of beliefs that they are signs of impending death, insanity, loss of control, embarrassment, and so on. In turn, these beliefs generate fear, more physical symptoms, and a snowball of anxiety and panic. 60 What About Panic Attacks That Come From \"Out of the Blue\"? After a number of times of being afraid of physical symptoms, the fear of physical symptoms can occur \"automatically.\" The \"auromatic\" quality is typical of much of what we learn. Think of when you first learned to ride a bike or to drive a car. Initially, it took a lot of concentration and selfinstruction abour what to do each step of the way. Gradually, it became automatic, so that you could ride and drive without consciously thinking about what you were doing. And yet, your automatic thoughts are still guiding the behavior of how to drive. The same thing happens with the negative thoughts associated with panic and anxiety. Over time, they can become automatic, so that you are not aware of what you are thinking; and yet, those thoughts still influence your feelings and behaviors. Because you are not aware of your thoughts, it might feel like panic and anxiety comes from \"out of the blue\"-you just feel afraid, and you do not know why. Another automatic process is called interoceptive conditioning. This means learning to be afraid of physical symptoms because of prior negative experiences in association with those symptoms. For example, imagine that you were violently ill every time you noticed a muscle spasm in your leg. Pretty soon, you would learn to be afraid of muscle spasms in your leg in anticipation of being violently ill. The same thing happens with panic; but in this case, the muscle spasm is a physical symptom that happens during panic (such as a racing heart), and the violent illness is the terror caused by beliefs that you might die, lose control, or go insane. Once the possibility of death or some other catastrophe is linked to a racing heart, changes in heart rate can cause automatic fear since the fear is conditioned. Consequently, even minor changes in heart rate that are normal, and did not bother you before you experienced panic, can cause you to become afraid. In fact, the physical change may be so subtle that you are not fully aware of it, and yet it still causes you to be afraid. This is another reason why panic attacks sometimes feel as if they come from out of the blue-they are actually being triggered by subtle physical changes ofwhich you are not consciously aware but to which your body has become conditioned to react. When judgments about the physical symptoms being dangerous occur automatically (or, without conscious awareness), or when the fear is conditioned to physical symptoms of even the slightest intensity so that you are not aware of what you are responding to, then panic attacks seem to occur 61 from nowhere. Also, remember that our fight-flight emergency response systems are designed in such a way as to respond instantaneously. Without such a capacity for instantaneous response, we would not be able to survive, because dangers can sometimes come at us very quickly. The consequence in terms of panic attacks is that automatic beliefs and conditioning can happen so quickly that the end result-the panic attack-seems as if it happened without time for thought or reaction. However, in reality, our fear is always triggered by something. That is, the physical symptoms, or the negative thoughts about physical symptoms, are always present, even if not immediately obvious. This is even true for panic attacks that occur from a relaxed state and for panic attacks that wake you up out of deep sleep (i.e., nocturnalpanic attacks). During relaxation, physical feelings are often different from normal, sometimes resulting in feelings of floating or being in a trance. If you are afraid of physical feelings that are different from normal, then the physical feelings you have during relaxation could trigger a panic attack. Nocturnal panic attacks are experienced by about one half of the people who suffer from panic disorder. About 25% have repeated panic attacks out of sleep. You might ask, \"How can nocturnal panic attacks be triggered by physical feelings\"? First, it is normal to have changes in physical rhythms during sleep. For example, heart rates and breathing rates increase and decrease at different times throughout the night. Second, we have the capacity to respond to meaningful events throughout our sleep. Think of the mother of a newborn child who wakes in response to the slightest sound from her baby while sleeping through other, louder sounds. Another example would be soldiers in combat who have the capacity to sleep through the sound of allied planes but wake to the sound of enemy planes. Thus, if physical changes are meaningful (in other words, if they are frightening), it is understandable that physical changes that normally happen throughout sleep could cause someone to wake out of sleep in a panic attack, in the same way that panic attacks happen during the day. This is especially likely to happen if the physical changes happen at a time throughout sleep when it is easier to be woken. For example, it is very hard to be woken out of deep sleep and out of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, but it is easier to be woken out of Stages 2 and 3 of sleep. Thus, a simplified model of panic attacks looks like the depiction in Figure 4.1. 62 Physical symptoms Anxiety about symptoms due to stress, due to interoceptive anxiety about panic, normal physical conditioning and negative mistaken beliefs changes that the physical symptoms are dangerous 1 (M~re symptoms ) .~ Panic Figure 4.1. A Simplified Model of Panic Attacks In summary, panic is based on the fight-flight response, in which the primary purpose is to activate the organism and protect it from harm. Everyone is capable of this response when confronted with danger, whether that danger is real or imagined. Associated with this response are a number of physical symptoms, behaviors, and thoughts. When physical symptoms occur in the absence of an obvious explanation, people often misinterpret the normal emergency symptoms as indicating a serious physical or mental problem. In this case, the physical symptoms themselves can become threatening and can trigger the fight-flight response again. Typical Mistaken Beliefs About Panic Symptoms As noted, when physical symptoms occur without an obvious explanation, we tend to search inwardly for an explanation; and in so doing, sometimes the normal symptoms of fear are misunderstood as a serious physical or mental problem. Such mistaken beliefs can result in a vicious \"fear of fear\" cycle. Common myths and mistaken beliefs about the physical symptoms of fear include sensations ofgoing insane, losing control, suffering nervous collapse, suffering a heart attack, and fainting. Let us now evaluate each of these. 63 Going Insane Losing Control Many people believe that the physical symptoms of fear or panic mean they are going insane. They are most likely referring to the severe mental disorder known as schizophrenia. Let us look at schizophrenia to see how likely this is. Schizophrenia is a major disorder characterized by such severe symptoms as disjointed thoughts and speech (such as rapid shifting from one topic to the next), sometimes extending to speech that does not make any sense; delusions or strange beliefs; and hallucinations. An example of a strange belief might be the perception of receiving of messages from outer space, and an example of a hallucination might be hearing a conversation when there is no one around. Schizophrenia generally begins very gradually and not suddenly, such as during a panic attack. Also, because this illness runs in families and has a strong genetic base, only a certain proportion of people can become schizophrenic, and in other people, no amount of stress will cause the disorder. In addition, people who become schizophrenic usually show some mild symptoms for most of their lives (such as unusual thoughts). If this has not been noticed yet in you, then the chances are that you will not become schizophrenic. This is especially true if you are over 25 years of age, because schizophrenia generally first appears in the late teens to early 2OS. Finally, if you have been through interviews with a psychologist or psychiatrist, then you can be fairly certain that they would have told you if you have schizophrenia. Some people believe they are going to \"lose control\" when they panic. They usually mean that they will become totally paralyzed and not able to move or that they will not know what they are doing and will run around wildly, hurting people, yelling out obscenities, and generally embarrassing themselves. Or, they may not know what to expect but may just experience an overwhelming feeling of being out of control. Even though panic attacks can make you feel somewhat confUsed and unreal, you are still able to think and function. In fact, you are probably able to think faster, and you are actually physically stronger, and your reflexes are quicker. The same kind of thing happens when people are in real emergencies64 Nervous Collapse Heart Attacks think of mothers and fathers who accomplish amazing things (such as lifting extremely heavy objects) and overcome their own intense fears in order to save their children. Sometimes, the strong urge to escape is misunderstood as losing control. For example, a patient at our clinic was driving to a job interview when she panicked, changed direction, and headed for her husband\\'s office instead. She believed that this was a loss of control. On the contrary, she was in complete control since she was doing whatever she thought was necessary to get to safety. Given her fears (she thought she was going to die), getting to her husband was a natural thing for her to do. Most people would do the same if they believed that they were about to die. So, the behavior was controlled. The problem was her mistaken belief that she was dying. Many people believe that their nerves might become exhausted and that they may thus collapse. However, this is not at all likely. As discussed earlier, panic is based on activity in the sympathetic nervous system which is then counteracted by the parasympathetic nervous system. The parasympathetic nervous system is, in a sense, a safeguard to protect against the possibility that the sympathetic nervous system may become \"worn out.\" Nerves are not like electrical wires, and anxiety cannot wear out, damage, or use up nerves, although continuous anxiety may make you more sensitive to negative events. Many people misunderstand the symptoms of panic as signs of a heart attack. This is probably because they lack knowledge about heart attacks. Let us look at the facts of heart disease and see how this differs from panic attacks. The major symptoms of heart disease are breathlessness and chest pain, as well as occasional palpitations and fainting. The symptoms in heart disease are generally directly related to effort. That is, the harder you exercise, the worse the symptoms, and the less you exercise, the better the symptoms. The symptoms usually go away fairly quickly with rest. This is very different from the symptoms of panic attacks, which often occur at rest and seem to have a mind of their own. Certainly, panic symptoms can 65 happen and even intensifY during exercise. However, this is different from the symptoms of a heart attack, because panic symptoms occur equally often at rest. Of most importance is the fact that heart disease will almost always produce major electrical changes in the heart which can be detected by an electrocardiogram (EKG) recording. In panic attacks, the only change that shows up on an EKG is an increase in heart rate. In and of itself, increased heart rate is not at all dangerous, unless it reaches extremely high rates, such as over 200 beats per minute, for prolonged periods, which far exceed the rates that occur during panic attacks. A typical heart rate during a strong panic attack is around 120-130 beats per minute. Vigorous physical exercise increases heart rate to around 150-180 beats per minute, depending on your age and fitness level. The usual heart rate when resting is anywhere from 60 to 85 beats per minute. Thus, if you have had an EKG and the doctor has given you the all clear, you can safely assume that heart disease is not the reason for your panic attacks and that panic attacks will not lead to heart disease. Fainting Fear of fainting is common in people with panic disorder, but actual fainting is very rare. The fear of fainting is usually based on the mistaken belief that symptoms such as dizziness and lightheadedness mean that one is about to faint. In fact, the state of panic is incompatible with fainting. The physical tension (sympathetic nervous system activation) of panic attacks is the direct opposite of what happens during fainting. Fainting is most likely to happen to people who have low blood pressure or who respond to stress with major reductions in blood pressure. Other common myths or mistaken beliefs about panic symptoms include the ideas that they may lead to an aneurysm, an epileptic attack, or to death from shock. Where 00 Mistaken Beliefs Come From? Information given to you from other people about the dangers of physical symptoms can be a very powerful agent for developing mistaken beliefs. For example, we have come across a dictionary definition of panic (in a reputable medical guide) as a state that can lead into psychotic depression. 66 Homework Self-Assessment That is misinformation, as there is no evidence to suggest that panic leads to psychosis. However, for someone without a background in psychological research, that kind of information could easily provide the basis for a fear of becoming psychotic during panic attacks. If someone is afraid of becoming psychotic, then it is understandable that the experience of panic is terrifYing, leading to anxiety about the next panic attack. Observing others be afraid of physical symptoms is another way in which one may develop mistaken beliefs. For example, children who observe their mother or father show excessive concern over health issues are probably more likely to develop mistaken beliefs about their own bodily symptoms. Finally, traumatic events that you have personally experienced may contribute to mistaken beliefs that physical symptoms are harmful. For example, surgeries (especially ones that did not go smoothly in the recovery phase), dangerous allergic reactions to drugs, or serious physical illnesses may contribute to tendencies to view physical feelings with caution. ~ Continue to record your anxiety and panic for one week, using the Panic Attack Records and Daily Mood Record. ~ Read chapter II, section I, over the course of the week. ~ Continue on to chapter 5 once you have completed at least one week of recording your panic attacks and moods and have read chapters 2-4 and chapter II, section 1.

T F 68 Establishing lOur Hierarchy of Agoraphobia Situations Goals Review information from recording panic attacks and moods Develop a hierarchy of agoraphobia situations Develop lists of superstitious objects, safety signals, distractions, and safety behaviors Review of Panic Attack and Mood Records Did you complete a mood record every day and record panic attacks as they occurred over the last week? If not, brainstorm ways of improving your ability to record. Ongoing recording of panic and anxiety is essential to this program. Remember that learning to interrupt your panic and anxiety depends on a complete and accurate description. It is impossible to change without knowing exactly what it is that has to change. In addition, accurate recording becomes more important as you progress through the next few chapters. So, developing good recording habits now will help you complete the rest of the program. To help you remember to complete the records, place the Daily Mood Record in a visible place, such as on the refrigerator, bathroom mirror, or next to your bed. Also, carry your Panic Attack Records with you wherever you go. If you have not done any recording, we strongly recommend that you use the following week to record your panic attacks and anxiety before continuing with the program. If you have kept records over the last week, fill in the data for the first week on the Progress Record: the number of panic attacks for the week, your average daily anxiety rating for the week, and whatever else you decide to chart. Also, look for any patterns from the week\\'s worth of panic attack records. For instance, do the panic attacks typically occur when you are 69 alone or when you are with someone else? Do they occur at a particular time of the day, such as in the evening? Do they occur more often during stressful portions of the day, such as when getting the kids ready for school? Are the symptoms the same each time, or do they vary depending on where the panic occurs? In addition, look for relationships between the Panic Attack Record and the Daily Mood Record. For instance, does panic occur more often when you are feeling generally more anxious or depressed? Does your anxious worry about panic increase after a panic or before a panic? Looking for patterns moves one closer to understanding that panic is a reaction to something. Despite how it feels, panic is not an \"out of the blue,\" automatic response. Reminder of the Role of Avoidance It is natural to avoid things that cause anxiety. Anxiety prepares us to avoid things so that we stay out of the way of danger and harm. However, too much anxiety leads to too much avoidance. Although avoidance provides relief from anxiety in the short term, it also causes you to continually feel anxiety in the long term. The longer we avoid the situations that worry or scare us, the scarier or more worrisome they become. Anxiety clJoo- Avoidance -J... Anxiety Avoidance prevents corrective learning (i.e., learning something new). Avoidance behavior is usually connected with overly negative thoughts. For example, if you think you will faint if you drive on the freeway, it makes sense that you would avoid driving on freeways. However, such avoidance prevents you from realizing that your negative thoughts about fainting are wrong. Approaching rather than avoiding situations or experiences is critical to overcoming fear and anxiety. But first, we will identifY the specific situations that you avoid and develop skills to help you to approach those situations. Establishing a Hierarchy of Agoraphobia Situations Look at the list of agoraphobia situations on page 72. Put a check next to the situations you currently avoid or are anxious about. It may be that there is something you regularly avoid that is not on the list. Put this under 70 \"other\" at the end. Input as many \"others\" as is necessary. Now use the situations you have checkmarked to create yout own hierarchy of up to ro items. The list should include mildly anxiety-provoking (i.e., rated at around 3 on a scale of0 to ro), as well as very anxiety-provoking (i.e., rated at 9 or ro) situations. These will be the situations that you will face over and over again. You may have only one or two situations, or you may have many more than ro situations that cause you anxiety. Conditions Here are some of the conditions to keep in mind which may influence the level of anxiety which you have in each agoraphobia situation. It is very important to include the conditions that make you feel more anxious. For example, if you always feel more anxious when you are alone, it will be essential to include items in your hierarchy in which you are facing situations alone. Distance From Home For example, freeway driving may be divided into a number of different tasks, depending on your distance from home (ro minutes from home versus one hour from home). These could be different items on your hierarchy, and it will be important to include further distances from home on your hierarchy if you typically get more anxious the further you are from home. Proximity to an Exit or Ease of Escape For example, the task of going to movie theaters may be more or less anxiety provoking, depending on how far into the middle of the row you are seated during the movie. Sitting in the middle of the row may be a lot more anxiety provoking than sitting on the aisle, if it is important to you to be able to get out of wherever you are. Similarly, freeway driving may be easier or more difficult depending on the distances between exit and entrance ramps. If this is the case, make sure that you eventually face situations where exits or escape are very difficult, even though you may start with situations from which there is an easy exit. 71 Typical Agoraphobia Situations Check those that apply Situations You Avoid or Are Anxious About Driving Traveling by subway, bus, taxi Flying Waiting in lines Crowds Stores Restaurants Theaters Long distances from home Unfamiliar areas Hairdressers Long walks Wide-open spaces Closed-in spaces (e.g., basements) Boats At home alone Auditoriums Elevators Escalators Other 72 Summary Time of Day For example, grocery shopping may be easier or more difficult, depending on whether the shopping is done in the morning, afternoon, or evening. For example, sometimes people are more anxious in the afternoons or evenings because they feel more tired and less able to cope with panic. Number of People Whether the situation is crowded or not may influence your level of anxiety. So, shopping during peak hours or driving at peak hours of traffic may be different from shopping or driving when conditions are much less crowded. If this is important to you, include items on your hierarchy that include crowded times. Accompanied or Alone Of course, the presence of friends or family often makes a big difference. Relying on certain other people is one form of reliance on a safety signal (as described in chapter 1). If you feel less anxious when you have certain people with you, you may begin facing your fear of agoraphobia situations with their aid, but it will be very important for you to eventually face the same situations without those people. So, your hierarchy should include facing situations without the help of others if being alone makes you more anxlOus. In the end, you will practice facing the situations listed on your hierarchy repeatedly, without long intervals between each practice, and in such a way that you derive information that proves your worries to be wrong. Therefore, the conditions have to be the right conditions. For example, if you worry about fainting only when you are shopping alone and not when you are shopping with a friend or family member, then it will be best to deliberately practice shopping alone. The goal is to provide direct experience that shows that your worries are unrealistic. So, now list your particular situations, including the conditions that make you most anxious. Then, rate each situation from 0 to 10, where 0 = no anxietyl 73 Agoraphobia Hierarchy Anxiety and/or Situation Avoidance (0-10) 5 -, B 10 Figure 5.1.i Example of Completed Agoraphobia Hierarchyi do not avoid and 10 = extreme fear/always avoid; ideally, you should have a range of anxiety/avoidance ratings from 3-10. The anxiety/avoidance ratings should be made in terms of how you would feel right now if you were asked to face this particular situation. If you end up with a lot of items that are below 3 or a lot of items that are above 8, use the list of conditions above to generate a broader distribution of situations. An example of a completed hierarchy is shown here. A blank hierarchy is also provided. Unhelpful Ways of Coping Now it is time for you to identify your own unhelpful ways of coping. Eventually, it will be essential to eliminate all of these ways of coping because they are all unhelpful in the long term. 74 Agoraphobia Hierarchy Anxiety and/or Situation Avoidance (0-10) _~ m~__~~ _ _ __ _- . _ __.._Superstitious Objects and Safety Signals As we had already discussed, superstitious objects and safety signals are objects or people on whom you depend as if they are necessary for your survival. They provide a \"sense of safety.\" Even though they seem to make life easier, in the end, safety signals strengthen fear and avoidance because they reinforce the mistaken idea that panic attacks are harmful. When you understand that there is no real danger, then the need for safety signals is removed. In other words, safety signals do not actually prevent danger because, in reality, there is no danger. However, realizing this comes with experience. In the meantime, it is necessary to know your safety signals. We have already discussed the roles played by other people. Additional superstitious objects and safety signals include telephones, sunglasses, purses, money (to call for help), paper bags (to breathe into), therapists\\' phone numbers, relaxation tapes, lucky charms, empty or full medication bottles, antacids, food, and familiar landmarks when travelling. To help you identifY your own safety signals, ask yourself what you never leave home without. 75 Or, to put it another way, consider the things that make you feel more anxious if they are not with you. List these in the space provided on page 77. This list of superstitious objects and safery signals will be incorporated into your hierarchy in one of two ways. One way is to face each item on your agoraphobia hierarchy first with and then without your safety signals. For example, you might drive two exits on the freeway first with a portable telephone, and then drive the same distance without the telephone. The second way is to eliminate safery signals from the beginning, facing the items on your hierarchy and always doing so without safery signals. The choice between these two approaches is up to you. In fact, for some hierarchy items, you can do it the first way; and for other items on your hierarchy, you can go the second way. Of most importance is that, eventually, you face the agoraphobia situations without your safery signals. Safety Behaviors and Distractions Some sryles of behaving may reduce anxiery in the short term but are unhelpful in the long term because they interfere with learning mastery. In particular, we are referring to examples of \"holding on for dear life,\" as if the situation that is being faced really is dangerous. Examples include remaining close to structures (such as buildings or rails) to provide a sense of physical support. This is particularly true for persons who fear falling. Remaining close to structures, however, strengthens the mistaken belief that collapsing is likely when \"our in the open.\" Another example is to keep a tight grip on the steering wheel for fear of losing control. In actualiry, it would be quite safe to lessen your grip to a more relaxed level. Other examples of safery behaviors include: placing the parking brake on at traffic lights to keep yourself from losing control of the car and inadvertently driving through a red light; driving very slowly on the freeway; or driving only in the right-hand-side, slow lane and close to exit ramps. Looking for exits is another safery behavior. For example, you might find yourself searching for exit signs when out at a large nightclub or looking back repeatedly to check on the visibiliry of the exit sign when shopping inside a mall. Again, the search for an exit is based on the mistaken belief of some danger happening if the situation was inescapable. Exit signs can also function as a safery signal. 76 Superstitious Objects and Safely Signals __ __ m_~__ __~ _...._-_..... m __m__.__~_-__-_.... ~._...__....._- -_....__....______ m .m__ . . _______m. ~ ____ -__-_ __ _- ~~ _.__....__....-_...__._._... _ _.... _-_..- _....~_..... _ - ~- 77 As mentioned earlier, distraction is another band-aid method that contributes to anxiety in the long term. You must eventually face your agoraphobia situations without the aid of distraction. Distraction can be obvious or subtle-but in all cases, it is a way of avoiding the situation. A very common distraction technique is to look away from the object of fear. For example, while you may face heights by ascending to the tenth floor of a building, you may be avoiding them at the same time by refusing to look out of the window or over the edge of the balcony. Similarly, you may face your fear of elevators by using them; but at the same time, you keep YOut eyes closed during the entire ride. More subtle methods of distraction include using imagination to pretend to be somewhere else or playing number games or word games until you are out of the tunnel, or after the bridge has been crossed, and so on. Other more dangerous and rare methods of distraction include self-inflicting pain or driving cars at high speeds under the assumption that the fright or pain will overwhelm and wipe out the panic. Ofcourse, in the end, the latter methods of distraction are much more dangerous than a panic attack. The best results come from an objective focus on one\\'s reactions to a given situation and on the situation itself Objective self-focus is exemplified by the following type of self-statement: \\'\\'I\\'m in the elevator, I can feel it moving, I can see the doors and the ceiling and the floor, I feel my heart beating, and my anxiety is moderate.\" Objective self-focus differs from subjective self-awareness, which is exemplified by a statement such as: \"I feel terrible, I will collapse, I can\\'t make it, I have to get out of here.\" Subjective focus is probably the style that you naturally engage in since it is part of being anxious and afraid. Most often, attempts to keep distracted alternate with brief but negative moments of subjective self-focus. For example, using counting games or imagery to keep yourself distracted is likely to be interspersed with momentary body-monitoring or questioning how bad you are feeling at a given moment. This combination of distraction and subjective self-focus is likely to contribute to continued anxiety. Your goal is to replace that style with an objective focus that enables you to be fully aware of what is going on. A goal of this program is to help you eliminate all of your safety behaviors and distractions. List your typical safety behaviors and distractions in the space provided on page 79. 78 Safety Behaviors and Distractions _ _ __._ __. _....._-.~ _ ____ m ___ m __ 79 Recognizing your superstitious objects, safety signals, safety behaviors, and distractions is not necessarily an easy task; indeed, we all get into habits of doing things in certain ways without being fully aware of what we are doing. One solution is to ask someone who knows you very well what kinds of things they have observed you do. For example, a husband, wife, sibling, parent, or friend may be aware of subtleties of your behavior of which you are not fully aware.

T F 80 Breathing Skills Goals To understand how breathing patterns contribute to panic and anxiety To learn diaphragmatic breathing To learn slow breathing To apply breathing skills as a coping skill We recommend that the information in this chapter be completed over a period of three weeks. Use the table in the introduction to know when to do each section of this chapter in relation to the chapters that follow. SECTION 1 Education and Diaphragmatic Breathing Am I Breathing Too Much or Not Enough? Many people overbreathewhen they panic-in other words, they breathe too quickly. In fact, 50-60% of people who panic show signs of overbreathing. This is also called hyperventilation. Technically, ro overbreathe or to hyperventilate means to breathe in more oxygen than is needed by the body. Overbreathing is involved in panic attacks in two ways. First, overbreathing may produce an initial physical feeling that frightens you and leads to a panic attack. Second, fear and panic may cause you to overbreathe. The symptoms of overbreathing include dizziness, lightheadedness, shorrness of breath, blurred vision, cold sweats, hot flashes and cold chills, feeling faint, a rapid heart rate, tightness or pain around the chest, slurred speech. Although symptoms of overbreathing can be very intense, they are not dangerous. 81 Let us consider whether overbreathing is an important part of your panics. To do so, answer the following questions. 1. In general, do you often feel short of breath, as if you are not getting enough air? 2. Do you sometimes feel as if you are suffocating? 3. Do you sometimes experience chest pains or pressure around your chest, including symptoms of tingling, prickling, and numbness? 4. Do you yawn or sigh a lot or take in big gulps of air? 5. When you are frightened, do you hold your breath or breathe quickly and shallowly? If you answered yes to any of those questions, then overbreathing may play at least some part in your panic and anxiety. Of course, ifyou are like many people, you may not be aware of your breathing patterns. Another way of knowing whether overbreathing is relevant to your panic and anxiety is to conduct the following overbreathing exercise. (Caution: Do not do this exercise if you have epilepsy, seizures, or cardiopulmonary diseases.) Sit in a comfortable chair, and breathe very fast and very deep, as if you are blowing up a balloon. It is important to take the air right down into your lungs and to exhale very forcefully. Continue for as long as you can, for up to two minutes. When you have finished the exercise, close your eyes and breathe slowly, pausing at the end of each breath. Continue the slow breathing for a few minutes, until the physical symptoms have passed. Now, think about what you experienced. Check off the symptoms from one of your Panic Attack Records. Did you experience symptoms similar to your panic attack symptoms? You may not have been as afraid as is typically the case because you had an obvious explanation for the symptoms (i.e., you deliberately caused the feelings by overbreathing). Nevertheless, were the physical symptoms similar to the symptoms you experience during naturally occurring panic attacks? If your answer is yes, then overbreathing probably contributes to panic attacks. If not, then overbreathing may not contribute to your panics. Either way, however, learning ways of regulating breathing can be a useful tool for helping you to deal directly with the physical symptoms and situations that you fear and avoid. 82 Education About Breathing Normal Breathing Anxiety and Overbreathing This brief explanation of the mechanics of breathing and the symptoms of overbreathing will help correct the mistaken belief that the symptoms of overbreathing are harmful. The body needs oxygen in order to survive. Whenever a person inhales, oxygen is taken into the lungs, where it is picked up by the hemoglobin (the \"oxygen-sticky\" chemical in the blood). The hemoglobin carries the oxygen around the body, where it is released for use by the body\\'s cells. The cells use the oxygen in their energy reactions. After using the oxygen, carbon dioxide is released back into the blood, where it is transported to the lungs and, eventually, exhaled. The balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide is important, and it is maintained chiefly through an appropriate rate and depth of breathing. Obviously, breathing \"too much\" will have the effect of increasing levels of oxygen (in the blood only) and decreasing levels of carbon dioxide, while breathing too little will have the effect of decreasing levels of oxygen and increasing levels of carbon dioxide. The appropriate rate of breathing, at rest, is usually around 10-14 breaths per minute. Hyperventilation is defined as a rate and depth of breathing which is too much for the body\\'s needs at a particular point in time. Naturally, if the need for oxygen and the production of carbon dioxide both increase (such as during exercise), breathing should increase appropriately. Alternately, if the need for oxygen and the production of carbon dioxide both decrease (such as during relaxation), breathing should decrease appropriately. Anxiety and fear cause us to increase our breathing because the muscles need more oxygen in order to fight or to flee from danger. If the extra amount of oxygen is not used up at the rate at which it is inhaled (as would be the case if there is no actual running or fighting going on), then the state of hyperventilation, or overbreathing, results. The most important effect of hyperventilation is to produce a proportionate drop in carbon dioxide (meaning that the amount of carbon dioxide is 83 low in proportion to the amount of oxygen). Our nervous and chemical systems are much more sensitive to levels of carbon dioxide than to levels of oxygen in the blood. A proportionate drop in carbon dioxide in turn produces a drop in the acid content of the blood, leading to what is known as alkaline blood It is these two effects-a proportionate decrease in the blood\\'s level of carbon dioxide and an increase in blood alkalinity-which are responsible for most of the physical changes that occur during hyperventilation. One of the most important changes produced by hyperventilation is a constriction or narrowing of certain blood vessels around the body. In particular, the blood going to the brain is slightly decreased. Together with this tightening of blood vessels, the hemoglobin increases its \"stickiness\" for oxygen. Not only does less blood reach certain areas of the body, but also, the oxygen carried by this blood is less likely to be released into the tissues. Although overbreathing means that we are taking in more oxygen than necessary, less oxygen actually gets to certain areas of the brain and body. This causes two groups of symptoms. First are symptoms produced by the slight reduction in oxygen to certain parts of the brain, including dizziness, lightheadedness, confusion, breathlessness, blurred vision, and feelings of unreality. Second are symptoms produced by the slight reduction in oxygen to certain parts of the body, including an increase in heartbeat (in order to pump more blood around); numbness and tingling in the extremities; cold, clammy hands; and, sometimes, stiffness of the muscles. It is important to remember that the reductions in oxygen are slight and totally harmless. Also, hyperventilating can produce a feeling of breathlessness, sometimes extending to feelings of choking or smothering, so that it actually feels as if there is not enough air. Hyperventilation also causes other effects. First, the act of overbreathing is hard physical work. It can make you feel hot, flushed, and sweaty, and after prolonged periods, it will often cause tiredness and exhaustion. Also, people who overbreathe often breathe from their chest rather than their diaphragm (the muscle beneath the rib cage). When chest muscles are used predominantly, they become tired and tender from overuse. This sometimes causes chest tightness or even severe chest pains. Finally, many people who overbreathe have a habit of sighing or yawning. Unfortunately, these contribute to the problem because yawning and sighing cause large quantities of carbon dioxide to be dumped out of the system very quickly, lowering the proportionate amount of carbon dioxide in the blood. 84 Breathe in more oxygen than is needed ~ Proportion of carbon dioxide drops rl Blood vessels tconstrict - - ~ Blood becomes Hemoglobin becomes more alkaline i- \"oxygen sticky\" r Less oxygen reaches the tissues Dizziness, lightheadedness, confusion, blurred vision, breathlessness, sense of unreality Faster and harder heart beats; numbness and tingling; cold, clammy hands; stiff muscles; sense of insufficient air Fatigue, chest tenderness, sighing, and yawning Figure 6.1. Physical Changes Caused by Overbreathing Hyperventilation is not always obvious, especially with mild overbreathing for a long period of time. In this case, there can be a large proportionate drop in carbon dioxide. Due to compensation in the body, the blood-acidity level returns to normal. Thus, symptoms are not present all of the time. However, because carbon dioxide levels remain low, the body loses its ability to cope with changes in breathing. Even a slight change in breathing (e.g., through a yawn or by climbing a set of stairs) can be enough to suddenly cause the symptoms to appear. This may explain the sudden nature of many panic attacks-a small change in breathing in someone who 85 has a general tendency to overbreathe, even if only mildly, causes acute hyperventilation. Probably the most important point to be made about hyperventilation is that it is not dangerous. Breathing Skills: Diaphragm Breathing Next is a specific exercise to teach the skill of diaphragmatic breathing. The purpose of this exercise is to learn a method of regulating breathing that will help you to deal directly with the physical symptoms and situations that currently make you anxious. This breathing skill is not designed to control or prevent feelings of fear and anxiety; rather, it is intended to help you face feelings of fear and anxiety and the situations in which they arise. exercise involves a breathing component, in which you learn to slow your breathing and to breathe using your diaphragm muscle more than the chest muscles, and a meditation component. Meditation means to focus your attention on the exercise of breathing. As with all skills, learning to meditate requires practice. The following exercise should be practiced at least twice a day, for at least 10 minutes each time. At first, the exercise may be hard, but it will get easier the more that you do it. Step One The first step is to concentrate on taking breaths right down to your stomach (or, more accurately, to your diaphragm muscles). There should be an expansion (increase) of the stomach every time you breathe in, or inhale. The stomach is sucked back in every time you breathe out, or exhale. If you are having trouble taking the air down to your stomach, place one hand on your chest and the other hand on your stomach with the little finger about one inch above the belly button. As you breathe in and out, only the hand on your stomach should move. If you are correctly doing the exercise, there should not be much movement from the hand on your chest. If you are 86 Step Two Step Three normally a chest breather, this may feel artificial and cause feelings of breathlessness. That is a natural response-just remember that you are getting enough oxygen and that the feelings of breathlessness will decrease the more that you practice. The second step is to breathe in normal amounts of air. Do not take in too much air, as it should not be a big breath. At this stage, breathe at your normal rate-do not try to slow down your breathing. We will work on slowing your breathing later. Also, keep your breathing smooth. Do not gulp in a big breath and then let it out all at once. When you breathe out, think of the air as oozing and escaping from your nose or mouth rather than being suddenly blown out. It does not matter whether you breathe through your nose or your mouth, as long as you breathe smoothly. The third step involves meditation. You will count every time that you breathe in and think the word \"relax\" as you breathe out. That is, when you breathe in, think \"one\" to yourself; and as you breathe out, think the word \"relax.\" Think \"two\" on your next breath in, and think \"relax\" on the breath out. Think \"three\" on your next breath in, and think \"relax\" on the breath out. Continue this until you count to around \"10,\" and then go back to \"one.\" Focus only on your breathing and the words. This can be very difficult, and you may never be able to do it perfectly. You may not past the first number without other thoughts coming into your mind. This is natural. When this happens, do not get angry or up. Simply allow the thoughts to pass through your mind, and then bring your attention back to the breathing, the numbers, and the words. 87 Homework Practice twice a day (or more, if you want to), about 10 minutes each time, in relaxing situations, such as a quiet place at home where you will not be disturbed. This new way of breathing may feel strange at first and cause feelings of breathlessness. That is natura1. Just remember that you are getting enough air and that it will get easier the more you practice. For now, do not use this new type of calm breathing at times of anxiety because trying to use a strategy that is only partially developed can be more frustrating and anxiety producing than not trying it at all. It would be like teaching scuba divers a way of dealing with underwater emergencies one time and then expecting them to use the skill successfully in an actual underwater emergency. Instead, scuba divers must practice the emergency procedure on land over and over again before using it underwater. So, for now, the breathing exercises should only be done in a quiet, comfortable environment. Once you have become skilled in the basic exercise of calm breathing, then we will apply it as a coping skill for anxiety. After each practice, record your levels of concentration on the breathing and counting and the success with which you are able to use your diaphragm muscle by using the Breathing Skills Record. You may photocopy this form from the book or download multiple copies at the Treatments ThatWork website (http://www.oup.com/us/ttw). Each form should last one week. This will provide feedback for you and your doctor or mental health professional. Remember that even if you cannot successfully learn this breathing skill, you are not in danger. This skill is helpful for the regulation of breathing, but it is not necessary. ~ Continue recording your panic attacks and your daily mood using the Panic Attack Record and the Daily Mood Record. At the end of each week, add the number of panic attacks and your daily average anxiety to your Progress Record. 88 Breathing Skills Record Rate your concentration on breathing and counting during the exercise and your success with relying mostly on your diaphragm for breathing, on ?-point scales (where ? = none and  = excellent), after each practice (twice per day). ?- ? - ? - ? - None Mild Moderate Strong Excellent Concentration on Date Practice Breathing and Counting Success With Breathing ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ~ Practice the diaphragm-breathing exercise twice a day, for 10 minutes each time, for seven days.

The goals of breathing skills are to help you deal directly with the physical symptoms and situations that make you anXIOUS. T F SECTION 2 Review and Slowed Breathing Review of Breathing Skills Practice Did you feel as if you were getting the air down toward your abdomen, as you would if you were mostly using your diaphragm muscle? Are you getting symptoms of anxiety when you practice? If so, this is probably due to 90 breathing a little fast or becoming anxious about your breathing as you pay attention to it. Keep practicing, and the anxiety will diminish. Are you having trouble concentrating on the counting? Practice will help your concentration. Simply redirect your attention back to the breath and the words (i.e., the numbers and the word \"relax\") each time you notice your mind wandering. Breathing Skills: Slowed Breathing This exercise is designed to slow your breathing rate by matching your breathing to your counting. Practice two times per day, for 10 minutes each time, for seven days, in a comfortable, quiet location. Count the number, and then inhale; think the word \"relax,\" and then exhale. In other words, put a little pause between each time you inhale and each time you exhale. Breathe at a rate of around 10 breaths per minute. This means to count (one second), inhale (two seconds), think the word \"relax\" (one second), and then exhale (two seconds). Every breath will take a total of six seconds from when you count to when you finish exhaling, which means 10 total breaths per minute. This does not have to be perfectly timed, but aim for something close to 10 breaths per minute. You may continue to practice with one hand on your stomach and one hand on your chest in order to encourage deep (i.e., diaphragm) breathing. The main goals are to slow down your breathing while maintaining a smooth and fluid flow of air and to use the diaphragm more than the chest. Remember to think of the air as oozing and escaping from your nose or mouth rather than being suddenly blown out, and remember to take a normal-size breath rather than a big breath. 91 Homework ~ Continue recording your panic attacks and daily mood using the Panic Attack Record and the Daily Mood Record.

T F 92 SECTION 3 Breathing Skills Coping Application Now that you are able to breathe at a slower rate, it is time to practice in different places, not just in relaxing places. Do the breathing exercise when you are at work, watching television, or out socially. Do as many minipractices as you can during the day. That is, instead of a full IO minutes, practice for a minute or two wherever you are, sitting at a traffic light, listening to someone else talk to you over the telephone, or while you are in the shower. Also, now it is time to apply breathing skills as a technique for helping you to face anxiety and situations that bother you. In other words, as you feel anxious symptoms building, begin to concentrate on slow, smooth diaphragmatic breathing. Count on your inhalations, and think the word \"relax\" on the exhalations. Continue by counting I-IO and then IO back down to I, slowing the breathing rate to about three seconds on the inhalation and three seconds on the exhalation. Remember, the goal is not to eliminate anxiety but rather to regulate your breathing, interrupt the panic cycle, and help you to go ahead and face the things that are making you feel anxious. Breathing skills are intended to move you forward, so that you can face and overcome your fears rather than hide from them. Use the breathing skills to help you \"breath through\" fear and anxiety. Also, remember that even if you do not control the symptoms of breathlessness, you are not in danger. This is very important. To believe that you must slow your breathing to prevent yourself from losing control, having a heart attack, or experiencing some other catastrophe adds unnecessary anxiety to the breathing exercise. Remember, hyperventilation is not dangerous. You may discontinue the two daily, IO-minute practices of breathing skills at this point, especially if you are easily able to breathe slowly from your diaphragm muscle. However, it does not hurt to continue the two daily practices, alongside the frequent mini-practices, especially if it remains difficult at times to achieve slow and diaphragmatic breathing. 93 Homework ~ Continue recording your panic attacks and daily mood using the Panic Attack Record and Daily Mood Record. At the end of the week, add the number of panic attacks and daily average anxiety to your Progress Record. Practice breathing skills in different, distracting environments, whenever possible. Apply breathing skills to help you continue in whatever activity or situation makes you anxious. ~ Continue with section 4 after you have completed one week of practicing breathing skills in different environments and with moments of anxiety.

When I become anxious, it is important to leave the situation that I am currently facing and practice slow breathing, so that I can calm myself down and then go home. T F 3. Breathing skills are intended to help me face situations and things that make me anxious. T F 94 SECTION 4 Review Review of Breathing Through Anxiety and Panic Did you use your breathing skills when you felt anxious as a way of helping you to continue whatever you were doing? What was the effect? Were you able to pick up on early signals of physical discomfort, or was it not until you found yourself gasping for breath that you tried the breathing exercise? If this was the case, become more aware of early signs that can prompt you to engage the breathing skills. Did you try the breathing exercise with a sense of desperation, to escape or prevent at all costs the symptoms of anxiety? If so, remember that the purpose of the breathing skills is not to prevent fear and anxiety but rather to enable you to do whatever you have to do, and continue moving forward, even though you may be anxious or panicky. If you are using breathing control with desperation (e.g., \"If I don\\'t slow down my breathing, I may die\"), you will only add fuel to the fire and, therefore, increase your panic and anxiety. Remember, even if you never learn to slow your breathing or to breath from your diaphragm muscles, you will survive. The goal is to use the breathing skills to help you face whatever is making you anxious; eventually, the anxiety will decrease.

Use the table in the introduction to know when to do each section of this chapter in relation to the chapters to follow. In earlier chapters, we discussed the importance of thoughts and, in particular, how negative thoughts can contribute to the snowballing cycles of anxiety and panic. In this chapter, you will build skills for changing your mistaken beliefs and negative thoughts. Thoughts Influence Emotions Imagine a friend walking toward you. Instead of smiling and saying \"Hello,\" this person walks straight past you without even acknowledging you. What might you think about this? If you think that the person is angry or upset with you, then you might feel anxious or depressed. If you think that the person is stressed out by something else and did not even notice you, then you might feel very little emotion or, perhaps, even feel compassion for them. Of course, this is relevant to panic disorder in that the ways in which you think about physical symptoms will influence how you feel about physical symptoms. Below is an example of different ways of thinking about the physical symptom of pain in your chest and about the emotional 97 Table 7.1. Examples of the Influence of Thoughts About Physical Symptoms on Emotions Event + Thoughts About the Event = Emotion Pain in chest Sign of heart attack Panic Pain in chest Sign of indigestion No panic Pain in chest Sign of muscle strain No panic Pain in chest Sign of cancer Panic Pain in chest Sign of tension and stress No panic effect, which is similar to the panic cycle that we described in chapters 3 and 4. The same is true for different ways of thinking about agoraphobia situations, as shown below. Emotions Influence Thoughts In addition, negative emotions cause more negative thoughts: feeling afraid increases the likelihood of having negative thoughts. This is because the number-one effect of the fight-flight system is to alert us to the possibility Table 7.2. Examples of the Influence of Thoughts About Agoraphobia Situations on Emotions Event + Thoughts About the Event = Emotion Elevator is old Elevator will get stuck; I Panic/Anxiety and slow will be trapped, panic, and make fool of myself Elevator is old Elevator is unlikely to get No Panic! and slowi stuck; and even if it Anxiety does get stuck, I will be able to handle it Stomach cramps Embarrassed to leave; Panic!Anxiety during a meeting will not get to bathroom in time Stomach cramps No big deal if I leave; No panic/ during meeting I can always make it to Anxiety bathroom 98 Emotions and Thoughts Cycle Table 7.3. Examples of the Influence of Emotions on Thoughts Thoughts About Emotion + Event = the Event Already anxious about walking away from home Relaxed about walking away from home Pain in chest Pain in chest More likely to think of heart attack, cannot make it home More likely to think of indigestion or muscle strain of danger. However, sometimes an obvious threat cannot be found. It is very difficult for us to accept not having an explanation for feelings of panic. (We talked about this in chapters 3 and 4.) When people cannot find an obvious explanation for their feelings, they turn their search on themselves. In other words, \"If nothing out there is making me feel afraid, then there must be something wrong with me.\" In this case, the brain invents an explanation, such as \"I must be dying, losing control, or going insane.\" As you can see from the information provided in chapters 3 and 4, nothing could be farther from the truth. The purpose of the fight-flight system is to protect the organism, not to harm it-it is our survival mechanism. The effect of being anxious on the ways in which we think is shown above. The fact that anxiety produces more negative thoughts helps explain why, when feeling calm, many recognize that their panic attacks will not cause them harm; but when in the midst of panic, the same people are convinced that their panic attacks are harmfuL So, panic and anxiety produce negative thoughts, and negative thoughts produce panic and anxiety. In the end, a cycle of negative thoughts and panic and anxiety develops. For all these reasons, learning to change the thoughts that contribute to anxiety and panic is very important. 99 Discovering Your Own Negative Thoughts At this point, you might think, \"I don\\'t tell myself anything when I panic, it just comes out of the blue.\" There is a dimension of awareness to our thinking. That is, sometimes we are fully aware of our thoughts; and at other times, our thoughts are so automatic that we do not even know what we are thinking. As an example of the latter, think of driving a car. There are many, many thoughts that go on as you pull out from a parking place (e.g., put my foot on the accelerator, put my foot on the brake, turn the wheel this way, look over my shoulder, pull out slowly, and so on). However, you probably are not aware of those thoughts. Thoughts are more likely to become automatic the more often we think them. So, for example, if you have believed for a long time that panic attacks cause heart disease, then that thought may occur without you being aware that that is what you are thinking-the thinking becomes automatic. Nevertheless, by careful selfobservation, we can usually dig up our automatic thoughts. Go to each item on your Hierarchy of Agoraphobia Situations and to each panic attack that you have recorded over the last week. For each agoraphobia situation, ask yourself, \"What will happen if I am forced to enter and remain in that situation?\" For each panic attack, ask yourself, \"What did I think could happen?\" Now it is time to be as detailed as you can. That is, rather than saying, \"I thought I could panic,\" list the different negative possibilities that came across your mind, even if only for a brief second, such as \"If I panic, I might die from a heart attack.\" If your descriptions of your thoughts are general, such as \"I felt horrible\" or \"I will feel anxious,\" ask yourself: \"Why was it so terrible? What did I think could happen?\" Or, if your thought was \"I could lose control,\" ask yourself what could have happened if you did lose control. In other words, be more specific than simply stating that you are afraid of panicking or afraid of becoming anxious in a situation. Panic and anxiety are emotional states in the same way that anger and excitement and sadness are emotional states. They are not inherently dangerous. When you say that you are afraid of having a panic attack, then it means that the panic signifies something bad happening to you, such as physical injury (heart attack, stroke, fainting), going insane, losing control, dying, or being shunned and embarrassed. These are the negative thoughts-the catastrophes-that contribure to the panic cycle. 100 Similarly, if your initial thought is that you are afraid of being trapped or that it will be too difficult to get out of a situation, think more about the reasons why that worries you. Remember, the need to escape from a situation is only relevant to the degree that you think something bad will happen if you are forced to stay in the situation. It may help to think of yourself as being literally trapped in your feared situation (e.g., imagine yourself stuck in an elevator or on a very long plane trip), and ask yourself what motivates you to want to leave. For example, the fear of being trapped might be based on fears of shouting, screaming, and hurting people in order to get our. Here is an example from a discussion between a therapist and a client with panic disorder. The therapist is helping the client to identifY the negative thoughts in as much detail as possible. T: What do you mean when you say that the fieling ofa racing heart is horrible? What is horrible about it? Well-it makes me.fiel very scared. T: What are you scared of c: It makes me worry about something going wrong-physically. What do you think could happen? C: Maybe my heart willjust keep goingfaster andfaster, and eventually, it will stop. T: And then what? C: Well, then I\\'ll die. T: What aboutyourfiars oftotally losing control? What do you mean by that? C: That\\'s hard to describe. I guess I don\\'t really know what it means. I just fielout ofcontrol T: What do you think could happen ifyou were totally out ofcontrol? C: T: That I couldn\\'t stop the way I was fieling. And what would happen ifyou couldn\\'t stop that fieling? 101 C:i Well, the feeling wouldget so intense that I wouldn\\'t be able to fUnction anymore. I\\'djust be a wreck. T:i And then what? C:i That would be the end ofmy life. I\\'d spend the rest ofmy life doing nothing. Use this type of approach to discover your thoughts for each panic attack over the past week and for each item on your Hierarchy of Agoraphobia Situations. List the details on the Negative Thoughts form provided on page 103. Remember, the method is to ask yourself, \"What am I afraid of?\" and to follow up with questions such as, \\'\\'And if that were to happen, then what?\" or \\'\\'And if that were to happen, what would that mean?\" With this amount of detail, it is easier to eventually dispel mistaken beliefs. So, continue questioning yourself until you find the specific negative predictions that you are making. Once you have identified the details of your thoughts in each agoraphobia situation and in each panic attack, continue with Section 2. SECTION 2 Jumping to Conclusions and Realistic Odds Mistakes in Anxious Thinking Years of research have shown that when we become anxious or panicky, we make two mistakes in our thinking. The mistakes are: (I) to jump to conclusions about negative events and (2) to blow things out of proportion. These mistakes lead us to believe that events are more dangerous than they really are and to make us more anxious. It is important to learn how to correct those mistakes. Jumping to Conclusions About Negative Events To jump to conclusions means to believe an event to be much more likely to happen than it really is. Can you think of times when you caught yourself jumping to a negative conclusion only to find out later that you were 102 Negative Thoughts ~~~-  ...~.._.-_... _ -_ _1. .. __ __ 2. _ 3 ~-_ __.5 - -~-.-_.-~- 6. . _ 7 -_.~_ _ . 8._~ _ _.. _-103 wrong? Maybe you were sure that you would not get tickets into the theater because you were at the end of the line, and then you did. Maybe you were convinced that someone was going to be upset with you, and they were not. This means that you were inflating the likelihood of a negative event. Now think about your panic and anxiety. How many times have you thought that something terribly wrong would happen, and how many times has it actually happened? Most often, you will find that what you are afraid of has never happened or has happened only rarely. For example, how many times have you thought that you might faint, and how many times have you actually fainted? Or, how many times have you thought that you would lose control and start screaming, and how many times has that actually happened? The fact that these things do not happen shows you that you are jumping to conclusions. You might say, \"Yes, I know those things are probably not going to happen, but I still get frightened by the possibility.\" Why do these mistaken beliefs persist? There are several reasons why you might believe that bad events could still happen in future panic attacks. Perhaps you have consistently avoided what you are really afraid of, so that you have not gathered evidence to the contrary. For example, perhaps you have avoided driving on freeways because of the mistaken belief that you might lose control of the car or pass out at the wheel. However, by avoiding driving, you have not given yourself the opportunity to learn that those things-losing control of the car or passing out-do not happen very often. This is one of the reasons why it is so important to face your fears. Maybe you think that what has happened in past panic attacks is not good evidence for what could happen in future panic attacks. However, for the most part, past experience is a good predictor of future experience. For example, if you have never fainted up until now, then chances are that you will not faint in the future. This is because the chances of fainting (or whatever else it is that you are afraid of) are pretty much the same each time that you panic. Or, maybe you think that the only reason why you have survived previous panic attacks is because of luck or because of something that you or someone else did at the time. This kind of reasoning leads to the belief that catastrophes could still happen in the future. For example, some people think that the only reason why they did not faint was because they managed to sit down just in time or to get help just in time. In actuality, they would _ _-_ _- _104 not have fainted even if they had remained standing or if they had not gotten help. Other examples are: \"I only made it because I managed to get to the hospital in time\"; \"If my wife hadn\\'t been there to help me, I could have died\"; \"I would have had a heart attack if I hadn\\'t lain down and rested.\" Taking the last example: in reality, the heart attack did not occur because the real chances of heart attack at that moment of panic are very, very small, regardless of how intense the symptoms are, regardless of whether you are in a hospital emergency room or at home, regardless of whether you are alone or accompanied, and regardless of whether you are lying down or remaining active. Sometimes, people think that catastrophes have indeed happened to them when, in reality, they have not. For example, sometimes the feeling of panic and the urge to escape are seen as evidence for actual loss of control. (We discussed this before, when describing common myths about panic symptoms.) In reality, actions are guided by whatever is regarded as the safest thing to do at that moment, given whatever it is that is feared could happen. For example, if you believe that you are about to stop breathing, then it makes sense to run outside into fresh air. Ifyou believe that you are about to have a stroke, then it makes sense to go to a hospital. If you believe that you are losing touch with reality forever, it makes sense to pinch yourself or even to pinch someone else to get back that feeling of reality. The mistake is to think that these types of behaviors show that you are out of control; in fact, what they do show is that you have mistaken beliefs about panic attacks. Another reason is the mistaken belief that the stronger the anxiety or bodily symptoms, the more likely it is that the catastrophe will happen. For example, \"I know I haven\\'t lost all touch with reality yet, but what if the feelings get worse than ever before? Then I really could flip out.\" Or, \"If my heart races any faster, then it will explode.\" In reality, the intensity of the physical symptoms is not evidence for them being more harmful. A similar belief is that the chances of harm increase over time because the damaging effects of each panic attack add on to each other. For example, some people believe that their heart is damaged with each panic attack and, therefore, that their heart will eventually give way if the panic attacks continue. As described in the previous section, there is no evidence that the body or nervous system is worn down in this way. General stress and worry may eventually have an effect on your body, but panic attacks themselves do not have this kind of negative effect over time. 105 A final reason why beliefs in catastrophes persist is because of something that we mentioned before-that negative thoughts become automatic, like a habit. That is, negative thoughts will come into your mind when you are anxious just through habit and despite the fact that your thinking is more logical at other times. Some of these types of reasoning are illustrated below in the interaction between Jane and her therapist. JANE:i I thought I was really going to lose it this time, that I wouldflip out and never return to reality. It never actually happened, but it could still happen. THERAPIST:i What makes you think that it could still happen? JANE:i Part ofmefiels like I\\'ve always managed to escape it just in time, by either removing myselffrom the situation, or by having my husband help me, or by holding on long enough fOr the fielings to pass. But what if, next time, I can\\'t hold on? THERAPIST:i Have you everflipped out and lost touch with reality? JANE:i I suppose you\\'re saying that, in reality, I can always hold on or that I can always escape in time. THERAPIST:i Not really, but rather, that you are jumping to a conclusion that ifyou do not hold on or do not escape, then you will flip out and never return to reality. JANE: But it really fiels like I will. THERAPIST:i The confUsion between whatyou think will happen and what actually happens is the very problem that we are addressing in this phase ofthe treatment. Examine the Evidence and Develop Realistic Odds Treat Thoughts as Guesses As we discussed before, fear and anxiety lead us to have mistaken beliefs; and, in turn, those mistaken beliefs contribute to fear and anxiety. In other words, jumping to conclusions about negative events and blowing things 106 Evidence-Based Thinking out of proportion make us feel anxious and afraid. The first step toward change is to treat thoughts as guesses rather than as facts. Once you recognize them as being guesses instead of facts, then you are in a posicion to recognize that your thoughts may be mistaken and, therefore, that they should be tested by looking at the evidence. Are your beliefs supported by evidence or not? The goal is to develop more realistic ways of thinking. This is not the same as positive thinking. In the long run, the\"Don\\'t worry, be happy\" notion, where we pretend that everything is okay, is not very helpful. But it does help to say, \"Wait a minute, maybe I am thinking about this in the wrong way-maybe the chances of me dying the next time I panic are small.\" Or: \"Even if others did notice that I looked anxious, maybe it wouldn\\'t be as bad as I thought.\" More realistic beliefs can be developed by considering all of the evidenceand from obtaining additional information, where necessary-such as the information covered earlier in this workbook. To consider the evidence, ask yourself, \"What are the real odds of this happening, has this ever happened before, what is the evidence that it will or will not happen?\" This means that you must look at all of the facts before you judge how likely something is. Examining the evidence helps us to see that negative events are less likely to happen than we first thought. For example, you may assume that you will fail a test; but in so doing, you have ignored the fact that you have prepared carefully. Or, a friend may be acting coldly, and you may think that they are displeased with you but overlook the possibility that they are angry at someone else or that they have had a bad day. In terms of panic attacks, you may think that tingling in the left arm is a sign of a heart attack and thus overlook the fact that you are in good health and that you have experienced the tingling many times before without having had a heart attack. Or, you may worry about panicking at the meeting and overlook the fact that, despite occasional panics in meetings, there have been many times when you did not panic in meetings. Similarly, you may think that you are going to faint while overlooking the fact that you have never fainted before and that people rarely faint during panic attacks. Or, you may think that you will lose control and scream wildly while ignoring the fact that you have never done that before. Also, you may think that the panic will reach such an intense level that it never 107 ends or cause you permanent damage while ignoring the fact that this has never happened before and ignoring the data about our inbuilt mechanisms, which restore balance (i.e., the parasympathetic nervous system) so that panics never continue forever. Or, you may think that the sense of disorientation you are experiencing means that you will go insane like the other person you knew who also was disoriented and who had become mentally ill; but you are overlooking the fact that there are many, many differences between you and the other person. Then, after considering the evidence, rate the actual odds of the event that you are worried about. Rate the odds on a a-lOa point scale, where a = It will never happen and lOa It will definitely happen. This rating is based on the evidence and not on how you feeL So, look at all of the data and evidence. The probabilities are very helpful for developing more realistic ways of thinking. Odds are more objective than a statement of \"I think it could happen\" or \"I think it probably will not happen.\" Mter you have recorded the realistic odds, generate alternative thoughts that are based on the data and evidence to replace the negative thought. All the different thoughts can be viewed as pieces of a pie. The example prolam MV heart rate anxious. is within safe MV levels. heart rate hasn\\'t c,hangecl at all - I\\'m just overlv aware of it. MV heart rate will eventually slow clown. MV This heart rate is a flue-tuates normal all the time c,hange for no real in mv reason. boclV Figure 7.1. Example of Completed Realistic Odds Pie Chart 108 vided below shows different ways of thinking about an increase in heart rate. The negative thought is shaded. The greater number of alternative thoughts in comparison to your one negative thought indicates the low likelihood of your negative thought actually coming to pass. The importance of looking at the evidence for the negative event is seen in the following interchange between Jane and her therapist. THERAPIST:i One ofyour negative thoughts is thatyou willflip out and never return to reality [negative event}. What leads you to think that this is likely to happen? JANE: WelL I guess it reaDy fiels like that. THERAPIST: Be more specific, ifyou can. Whatfielings? JANE: Well I fiel spacey and unreal like thing.r around me are dif ferent and that I\\'m not connected [reasoningfVr negative event}. THERAPIST: And why do you think those fielings mean that you have lost touch with reality? JANE: I don\\'t know-itjust fiels as ifI have. THERAPIST: I see-let\\'s look at some ofthe evidence. Do you respond if someone asks you a question at those times? JANE: WeD, I respond to you even though I fiel that way sometimes in here. THERAPIST: Okay, and can you walk or write or drive when you fiel that way? JANE: :Yes, but itfiels different. THERAPIST: So, it sounds like you perftrm those fUnctions despite fieling detached. What does that tellyou? JANE: WelL maybe I haven\\'t lost complete touch with reality. But what ifI do? THERAPIST: How many times have you fiit detached? JANE: Hundreds oftimes. THERAPIST: And how many times have you lost touch with reality permanently? 109 JANE:i Never. But what ifthe feelings don\\'t go away? Maybe I\\'ll lose it then. THERAPIST:i So what else tells you that this is a possibility? JANE:i What about my second cousin? He lost it when he was about 25, and now, he\\'s just a mess. He can hardly do anything on his own, and he is constantly in and out ofpsychiatric wards. They have him on a bunch ofheavy-duty medications. I\\'ll neverftrget the time I saw him totally out ofit-he was talking to himselfin gibberish. THERAPIST:i So, you think you\\'ll be like your cousin. Are there things that are different between you and him? It sounds like he may have something like schizophrenia. JANE:i .Yes, that is what I was told. THERAPIST: So, let\\'s consider all ofthe evidence and some alternatives. IOu havefelt unreal hundreds oftimes, andyou\\'ve never lost touch with reality because you\\'ve continued to fUnction in the midst ofthose feelings, and they have never Wstedftrever. IOu are a.fraid ofbecoming like your cousin, but he is suffiring.from schizophrenia, andyourpanic attacks are completely different.from schizophrenia. Also, keep in mind our previous discussion ofwherefeelings ofunreality can come .from-.from being physically tense and.from overbreathing. So, what are the realistic odds that you will lose touch with reality permanently? Use a D-IOO point scale, where 0 No chance at all and IOO Definitely will happen. JANE: Well, maybe it is lower than I thought. Maybe 20%. THERAPIST:i So, that would mean thatyou have actually lost touch with reality in a permanent way once everyfive times you have felt unreal? JANE: When it\\'s put like that, I guess not. Maybe it\\'s a very small possibility. THERAPIST:i .Yes, so what is a different way ofthinking about the feelings ofunreality? 110 JANE:i Perhaps feeling anxious or overbreathing causes them, and they don\\'t mean that I am losing touch with reality or that I am like my cousin. Cha~ging Your Own Odds Look at your list of Negative Thoughts, and identifY examples of where you were jumping to conclusions. (i.e. concerns about a negative event that you frequently worry over but that has never happened or has only rarely occurred.) Then, examine the evidence for each example by completing the following steps, using the Changing Your Odds form as you go. You may photocopy this form from the book or download multiple copies at the Treatments ThatWork website (http://www.oup.com/uslttw). I. Has what I am worried about ever come true? II.i What are the mistaken reasons why I continue to worry? Have I avoided the situations that would help me gain a more realistic understanding? Am I mistakenly thinking that evidence from past panic attacks does not apply to future panic attacks? Am I mistakenly thinking that I have been lucky or that things that I have done in the moment of panic have actually saved me from negative things happening? Am I mistakenly thinking that the negative thing I worry about has actually already come true, when in fact, it has not? Am I mistakenly thinking that the risk of negative things happening increases with the intensiry of panic and anxiery? III.i What is the evidence? Ask yourself the following. a. \"What is the evidence to suggest that it will happen?\" b. \"What is the evidence to suggest that it will not happen?\" Remember to not confuse your behaviors with the evidence regarding what you are most worried about. For example, if you believe that you are about to stop breathing, then it makes sense to run outside into fresh air. However, it is incorrect to view these 111 behaviors as signs of a loss of control; they are logical actions, given the anxious thoughts. Consider whether you are confusing low probabilities (odds) with high probabilities (odds) or acting and feeling as if negative results are guaranteed to occur, as opposed to being just possible. IV.i What are the actual odds? Rate the actual odds of whatever it is that you are most worried about after having considered all of the evidence. Rate the odds on a 0-100 point scale, where 0 It will never happen and 100 = It will definitely happen. o n IO- 20 - 30-40 50 n 60 -70 80 - 90 - IOO _nni n Never Slight Moderate Strong Definitely will happen chance chance chance will happen V.i What are different ways of thinking that are more based in evidence? Use a pie chart to list different ways of thinking. Think of as many different ways of thinking as you can alongside your negative thoughts as one piece (the shaded piece) of the pie chart.

T F 6.i Negative thoughts can occur so rapidly and automatically that you may not be aware of them. T F SECTION 3 Facing the W0rst and Putting Things Into Perspective Seeing Things Out of Perspective In the last section, we discussed jumping to conclusions. A second mistake that happens in our thinking whenever we are anxious is to blow things out of proportion or to think of situations as \"insufferable\" or \"catastrophic\" when, in actuality, they are not. Typical examples are: \"If other people noticed that I was feeling very anxious or panicking, it would be terrible, and I could never face them again\"; \"It would be disastrous if I fainted\"; \"I couldn\\'t cope with another panic attack\"; or \"It would be horrible if I felt anxious.\" If you stop to examine the situation realistically, usually it is not as awful as it seemed at first. For example, fainting, while extremely unlikely, is not such a terrible event. Fainting is actually an adaptive mechanism designed to reestablish the \"balance\" of bodily functions. Similarly, if 114 another person noticed that you were anxious, the worst that might happen is that they would feel awkward, not knowing how to respond, or feel sympathy for you. Or, if someone did think you were weird, the worst that would happen is that they would not think of you in the way that you would like. Another common catastrophic thought is, \"Anything could happen the next time I panic. I don\\'t know what it is, but it is going to be something bad.\" Again, this kind of negative thought generates anxiety. But if you examine the evidence and consider the worst that can happen, it is not as bad as you at first think. Facing the Worst and Putting Things Back Into Perspective Facing the worst and putting things back into perspective means to face whatever it is that is scaring you and, in so doing, to realize that it is not as bad as you at first thought. This is done by switching gears from focusing on \"how bad it would be if ...\" to considering \"ways of dealing with....\" When you come right down to it, everything is manageable to some degree. No matter how intense yout fear is, you will survive. No matter how embarrassing the moment, it will pass. No matter how bad the event that you worry about, there is a way of getting through it. In other words, there is always a way of coping, and it is always possible to get through even the worst situations. For example, what if you actually did faint? What if others actually commented on the fact that you appeared shaky and nervous? What if you did scream and draw attention to yourself? What if you actually did walk out of a room because you felt trapped? Your first reaction to these questions might be something like \"That would be awful or terrible,\" or, \"I couldn\\'t stand it.\" That is, however, blowing things out of proportion. When you really think about it, you will find that you have assumed them to be worse than they are. In addition, there probably is a way of coping. Brainstorming ways of dealing with negative events (which is sometimes called probLem-soLving) is much more helpful than thinking only about how horrible it would be. For example, let us say that you fainted in front of a group of people. Think of ways of coping. What would you do? Picture what would happen to you 115 Example 1 as you woke up out of the faint; what might you do, what might you say, what would happen next? Maybe people would help you. Maybe you would ask for some water. Maybe you could say that you have not been feeling well lately, or that you have been suffering a severe flu, or that you were low on blood sugar, or even that you have been under a lot of stress-you can say whatever you want! Then what would you do? Maybe you would go home for the rest of the day. And what would you say to people the next day if they asked how you felt? And so on. The basic point is that we can stand any misfortune that happens to us. It is only the belief that we cannot stand it that creates the anxiety. We can literally endure anything that befalls us until the day we die-and then, it does not matter anymore. Facing the worst and putting things back into perspective can be summed up in one phrase: So what? (The \"So what?\" strategy, however, does not apply to certain events, such as death, the loss of a loved one, or behaviors that conflict with strongly held religious beliefs or values.) Here are two examples of putting things back into perspective. c: I don\\'t like to be in a crowd because ifI panic, I mightfaint, and I don\\'t know what would happen to me then. T: Have you ever fainted before? C: No T: So, how likely do you think it is that you wouldfaint? C: Okay, maybe not very likely, but I know I\\'d have to leave, and that would be embarrassing. T: Have you ever been embarrassed before? C: Oh,yes. T: Well you\\'re here, so I take it that you survived being embarrassed How long does your embarrassment usually last? C: Well, it\\'s badfor afew minutes, then it kind ofgoes away. I don\\'t know. Maybe it lasts a couple ofhours in alL 116 T:i Okay, so it\\'s not very likely thatyou wouldfaint, butyou might leave, and that might be embarrassing, but embarrassment doesn\\'t really last very long. Example 2 c:i I am worried that I might lose control and do something crazy, like yell and scream. T:i Asidefrom the very low likelihood ofthat happening (as we discussed before), let\\'s face the worst and ask what is so bad about it. What would be so horrible about yelling and screaming? C:i I could never live it down. T:i Well, let\\'s think it through. What are ways ofcoping? C:i Well, I guess the yelling and screaming would eventually stop. T:i That\\'s right-at the very least, you would eventually exhaust yourself What else? C:i Well, maybe I would explain to the people around me that I was having a really bad day, but that I would be okay. In other words, reassure them. T:i Good. What else? C:i Maybe I wouldjust get away-find somewhere to calm down and reassure myselfthat the worst is over. T:i That\\'s right. And maybe there are other things you could do, too. Your anxiery may increase as you begin to focus on these kinds of images and thoughts. However, the thoughts become less anxiery provoking the more often you face them. Only by facing them directly can you learn that the worst is not as bad as you first imagined. Remember, everything passes with time, and there is always a way of managing even the worst situation. In summary, deal with times when you blow things out of proportion by (1) facing the worst; (2) realizing that even the worst situations pass with time and can be managed; and (3) thinking of ways of coping with the situation and with your feelings in the situation. 117 Changing Your Own Perspective Go back to your list of Negative Thoughts from Section 2, and identifY examples of where you were blowing things out of proportion. (You will know this if it feels like what you are worried about is catastrophic or beyond your coping abilities.) Then, face the worst, and consider ways of coping for each example by following the steps provided and completing each section of the Changing Your Perspective form as you go. You may photocopy this form from the book or download multiple copies at the Treatments ThatWork website (http://www.oup.com/uslttw). I.i Face head-on whatever it is that are most worried about happening. II.i Recognize that whatever it is you are worried about is not going to last forever and is survivable. (This does not, however, include events such as death, significant loss, or behaviors that conflict with strongly held religious beliefs or values.) Develop different ways of thinking, and record that next to the section titled \"Will this pass and will I survive?\" Remember-the goal in doing this is not positive thinking but realistic thinking. For example, if you believe that you would never emotionally recover from an embarrassing moment or from feeling afraid, think about the fact that these feelings are temporary, and realize that you would in fact recover. In general, the goal is to realize that you will be able to survive whatever happens to you and that whatever it is you are most worried about will not last forever. III. Develop ways of coping Switch gears from focusing on \"how bad it would be if a difficult situation happened\" to considering \"ways of dealing with a difficult situation.\" List actual coping steps. Thinking Skills in General Sometimes your negative thoughts will be based on just one mistake-either jumping to conclusions or blowing things out of proportion-in which case, you would deal with just that one. Sometimes both mistakes are pres118 119 Changing Your Perspective Negative thought: Will this pass, and will I survive? Ways of coping: Summary of Thinking Skills ent, in which case, you would examine the evidence to generate realistic odds and alternative, evidence-based ways of thinking so that you do nor jump to conclusions, as well as face the worst, realize that even bad situations pass with time and are manageable, and think of ways of coping with the situation and your feelings in the situation in order to put things back into perspective. Do not be discouraged if this approach to thinking skills seems artificial at first. As with other skills in this program, learning to change your negative thoughts takes practice. With repetition, it wiH get easier, and the new ways of thinking will become more natural. Eventually, it will become so natural that you will not have to go through the entire process of finding negative thoughts and looking at the evidence or facing the worst-instead, you will automatically think in less negative ways. Also, remember that the primary goal for thinking skills is notto eliminate anxiety. Instead, the thinking skills are intended to correct mistakes in your thinking so that you can continue to move forward and face the situations and things that make you anxious; eventually, your anxiety will subside. The first step is to know the details of what you are most worried about happening in a specific situation. For worries that involve jumping to conclusions (i.e., repeated worries about a negative event that rarely or never happens), the steps include the following: I.i Ask, \"Has what I am most worried about come true?\" (If traumatized, however, the question refers to the interval of time since the trauma.) 2.i Consider mistaken reasons for why the worry continues. 3.i Review all of the evidence. 4-i Consider the realistic odds. 5.i List different ways of thinking that are more evidenced based. 120 Homework Self-Assessment For worries that involve blowing things out ofproportion, the steps for putting things into perspective include the following. 1.i Face the worst as if it were actually happening, and realize that even the worst situation is survivable. 2.i Switch from thinking about how bad it would be to steps of coping with the negative event if it were to happen. ~ Continue recording your panic attacks and daily mood using the Panic Attack Record and Daily Mood Record.

Even if I do nothing, it will pass. T F SECTION 4 Review ofThinking Skills and Dealing With Memories Review of Thinking Skills Practice Have you been able to pin down your negative thoughts in a lot of detail and whenever you became anxious or panicky? Have you labeled the negarive thoughts such as jumping to conclusions or seeing things out of perspective? Were you able to examine the evidence and put things back into perspective by looking at the realistic probabilities and facing the worst, realizing that difficult situations and emotions are time limited and that there always are ways of coping? Were you able to say, \"So what\"? It might feel artificial at first to always examine and change your thoughts. However, as you practice, this style of thinking will become more natural. It is the same as when we learn a new language: initially, it takes a lot of effort and seems unnatural, but with practice, it becomes more natural. Keep in mind, also, that the goal of your work with your negative thoughts is not to get rid of anxiety or the physical symptoms immediately. Instead, the goal is to correct the mistaken thinking-the jumping to conclusions and the blowing things out of proportion-which contributes to the snowballing spiral of fear and anxiety. For example, let us say that you begin to feel dizzy and scared. You identifY the negative thought as, \"This dizziness makes me feel as if I am about to faint.\" You use your thinking skills by realizing that \"I have felt dizzy many times before, and I have never fainted, so it is very unlikely that I will faint. The dizziness is just an uncomfortable symptom probably due to a change in my breathing or my anxiety level.\" Then, you notice that you are still feeling dizzy. The persistence of physical symptoms does not mean that your thinking skills have failed. Your new analysis that the feeling of dizziness is harmless is still accurate. Dizziness just may take some time to subside. Related to this, remember that some physi122 cal symptoms occur no matter how anxious or afraid you are. All of us have times when we feel off-balance, short of breath, lightheaded, trembly, or a racing heart. In other words, even if you use your thinking skills properly, you may still have occasions when you feel physical symptoms that remind you of panic attacks. Also, watch out for the \"don\\'t worry, be happy\" syndrome. For example, compare someone who says, \"It will be okay, I\\'m fully in control, nothing bad will happen,\" to someone who says, \"What am I afraid of? I\\'m afraid of fainting. How likely is it that I will faint, given the fact that I have felt this way so many times before and have never fainted? I know that I tend to jump to conclusions about the risk of fainting. The feelings will pass.\" The first person is trying for a quick fix, which does not really work in the long run. The second person is examining his or her thoughts and looking for new ways of thinking based on real evidence. This is what works in the long run. Finally, remember that you are learning a new skill. Therefore, it takes time for the new ways of thinking to become more powerful than the old ways of thinking. In other words, \"old habits die hard.\" For this reason, it is not unusual for negative thoughts to reappear despite previous successes in looking at the evidence and putting things back into perspective. Treat the old negative thoughts in the same way as you did the first time; that is, for each time a negative thought comes to mind, even if it is the same one time and time again, repeat the strategy of looking at the evidence, facing the worst, and putting things back into perspective. Repetition makes the new way of thinking stronger and more natural. Dealing With Frightening Memories Whenever a past event is given a lot of significance (such as when thought of as horrible), it is more easily remembered. In addition, the more frequently an event is remembered, the more likely it will be remembered again. Frightening memories then lead us to think of related future events as frightening also. Therefore, if you tend to think of the worst panic that you have ever had as a terrifying, horrific experience, something that you do not fully understand, and, in fact, it scares you just to think about it, then that memoty probably contributes to your anxiety about future panics. 123 Many of our clients become less anxious and less on edge about the next panic attack after they learn to understand their past panics rather than just being horrified by them. This comes from forcing yourself to think about past panic attacks using a matter-of-fact approach. To do this, first, recall the worst panic and, as clearly as you can, remember the context. This includes the people, the place, the sounds, the colors, the objects around you, and anything else. Imagine it as clearly as you can by placing yourself in the picture not as an observer, but as someone in the scene. Remember how you felt. You might become quite anxious or fearful as you think about that event. Statements such as, \"I hate to even think about it,\" \"I hope I never experience anything like that again,\" \"I couldn\\'t go through that again,\" \\'\\'I\\'m sure I nearly died,\" or \"I was so lucky to survive\" are a good indicator of the importance of the next section. Think about the worst panic again, particularly, the way you felt. IdentifY what, in retrospect, were the triggers for the panic: was it a physical symptom, was it a negative thought, was it a time you were under a lot of stress? How did you react? What was the first thing that happened? Did you have some negative thoughts, and did they produce more physical symptoms? Use a step-by-step analysis: Did you jump to any conclusions (e.g., did you think that you were going to die)? Did you blow things out of proportion (e.g., did you think that everyone would notice and think you were crazy)? What was the next thing that happened? Did you become more frightened? What did you do? Did you go to a hospital, or try to escape, call for help, or lie down? How did this add to the fear cycle? Furthermore, what was the actual end result? In other words, you did survive, and you did not die, lose control, or go crazy. Your goal is to think it through in a matterof- fact manner, so that it becomes understandable. In other words, come to the realization that the reason you panicked is because, for example, you felt some unusual physical symptoms, had negative thoughts that something was terribly wrong, and these led you to become intensely afraid. Also, realize that, in the end, nothing was terribly wrong and that the worst that happened was that you became afraid. Continue to repeat this exercise of rethinking through a worst panic attack until thinking about it no longer makes you feel anxious, until you have an understanding of why it happened; and until you realize that you did survive. We call this processing a past event, of which the goal is to have less124 disturbing memories about it and, therefore, to be less anxious about the same thing happening again in the future. Homework Continue recording your panic attacks and daily mood using the Panic Attack Record and Daily Mood Record. At the end of the week, add the number of panic attacks and daily average anxiety to your Progress Record.

SECTION 1 Planningfor and Practicing facing Agoraphobia Situations Value of Directly Facing Agoraphobia Situations Up until now, our focus has been upon coping with anxiety. Now, it is time to move into learning from direct experience. In many ways, direct experience is the most powerful way of learning. It is essential that you eventually repeatedly face and deal with all the situations on your hierarchy. By avoiding those situations, new learning is prevented; instead, fear and anxiety are reinforced. The more you avoid something, the more you will remain anxious about whatever it is you are avoiding. You may choose to involve a significant other in this phase of treatment, in which you will be directly facing the agoraphobia situations that make you anxious. If so, read chapter 9. 127 Reasons Why Past Attempts May Have Failed Sometimes people believe that they have already tried to face agoraphobia situations, without any success. As a result, they mistakenly judge that this treatment approach does not work. However, it is likely that previous unsuccessful attempts at facing the fear were not structured in exactly the right way. We review the possible reasons why it may not have worked in the past as a way to present the correct method of conducting exposure exerCIses. Possibly, you believe that you practiced facing agoraphobia situations when, in fact, you did not. For example, being forced into a situation is not the same as setting up a specific task to practice over and over again. A onetime drive on the freeway to visit a sick family member in an emergency is not the same as practicing driving on the freeway three to four times a week in order to overcome a driving phobia. So, it is important not to confuse difficult or negative one-time experiences with truly facing your fear of agoraphobia situations. Attempts to face agoraphobic situations may not have been done frequently enough, meaning that there was too much time between one practice to the next. For example, walking around a shopping mall once a month is much less helpful than walking around the mall once a week. Related to this is the possibility that the practice was not continued for long enough. For example, 90 minutes per day practicing being alone is much more helpful than just 5 minutes of practice per day. This is because a sufficient length of time is needed for new things to be learned. Facing your fear for brief periods of time decreases the chances of learning something new. Most importantly, the practice may not have involved the right conditions. Repeatedly facing agoraphobia situations only works if you learn what is critical for you to learn. For example, if your fear of shopping malls is based on the notion that you will go insane if you spend more than 15 minutes in the mall, then the practice that will give you the critical learning is to shop for more than 15 minutes so that you learn that you do not lose your mind. Repeated practice for less than 15 minutes will not provide critical learning. Perhaps you relied too much on superstitious objects, safety signals, safety behaviors, or distractions as you attempted to face agoraphobia situations. 128 Use of Medication Remember, these are unhelpful ways of coping because they interfere with corrective learning and contribute to anxiety in the long term. Systematic, frequent, and lengthy practices under the conditions necessary for critical learning, without safety signals, superstitious objects, safety behaviors, or distraction, will be much more successful. The practices with agoraphobia situations are intended to do three things: 1.i Gather new information that will help you fully realize that what you are worried about happening is very unlikely to happen or never happens, that when you face the worst, it is not as bad as you first thought, and that there are ways of coping, even with difficult situations. 2.i Let you learn that you can handle and survive the feelings of anxiety and fear. 3.i Show you that you can accomplish the things that you have been avoiding. The use of medication has to be considered: particularly, medications that either block all of your feelings or medications that you rely on to reduce your fear in the moment (the latter include fast-acting medications, such as Xanax and Klonopin). If medications are so potent that they block all feelings, then they may interfere with the benefits you can receive from actually facing your fear of agoraphobia situations. That is, some anxiety is very helpful-we learn more when we are anxious in comparison to when we are completely relaxed. So, if your anxiety and panic are completely blocked by medications, it may be helpful to talk with your prescriber about lowering the dosage of medication. The second issue concerns the use of fast-acting medications. Initially, when you first face agoraphobia situations, you may feel the need for Xanax or Klonopin because those medications have been your usual coping tool. That is acceptable, as long as you eventually become comfortable enough 129 so that you can face these situations without those medications. (We talk more about ways of reducing medications in chapter II.) Your Practice Facing an Agoraphobia Situation Design of the Practice Now it is time to design your practice with an agoraphobia situation. Choose the first item from your hierarchy, and go through the following steps. 1.i Identify what it is that you are most worried about happening in this situation. This is called the Negative Thought. This could be a concrete outcome, such as fainting, going insane, or having a heart attack, or it could be the idea that you cannot handle the anxiety associated with the situation. II.i Think about the best conditions in which to practice so that you can truly learn that your negative thoughts are unrealistic. These are called the endgoals. For example, if you believe that you could walk from one end of the mall to the other one time without fainting, but you are convinced that you would faint if you were to walk to the end and back again, then of course the best conditions for you to practice are to walk to the end and back again. Similarly, if you believe that you could walk into the mall for 10 minutes one time only but that to return into the mall three times would certainly cause you to faint, then of course the best conditions to practice will be to return to the mall three times. So, take into account how long you need to be in a situation or how many times you need to face the agoraphobia situation in order to learn that whatever you are most worried about either does not happen or that you can cope. At the same time, learning that your negative thoughts are unrealistic will require that you let go of all superstitious objects, safety signals, safety behaviors, or distractions. So, go back to your lists of Superstitious/Safety Signals and Safety Behaviors/Distractions from chapter 5, and plan for eventually practicing each agoraphobia situation without anything on those lists. 130 There is one possible exception to these objects, which is the cellular phone. In today\\'s world, cell phones can sometimes be very helpful in the event of a true emergency. We recommend traveling without them only to learn that you will not die from a heart attack, faint, or be otherwise incapacitated if you do not have your cell phone on hand. At the same time, we recognize that cell phones can be valuable tools if your car breaks down. III. Choose either to gradually work up to the end goals or to go directly to the end goals. For example, if the end goal is to walk around the mall for one hour alone (because that is the point at which you currently are sure that you will faint if you are alone), you may start by completing 20 minutes with a friend and then 20 minutes alone; 40 minutes with a friend and then 40 minutes alone; and 60 minutes with a friend and then 60 minutes alone. Or, you could go straight to doing the full 60 minutes alone. TOday\\'s goals are the conditions in which you will practice on a given day as you work toward your end goals. An example is shown here. IV. Use your thinking skills. In preparation for the practice, ask yourself the following. Has what you are most worried about ever happened? (If it has not or rarely has, then you are jumping to conclusions?)

Example of Part of Completed Facing Agoraphobia Situations Form Using Thinking SkiJ1s What is the worst that can happen, and how would you cope with it? (If the worst feels unbearable, and you feel as if you could not cope, then you are blowing things Out of proportion.) Then: a.i look at all the evidence; b.i consider the real odds; c.i realize that the worst is probably not as bad as you first thought; and d.i think of ways of coping. An example of using these thinking skills is shown above. This situation is to be practiced at least three times over the next week (either going straight to your end goals or gradually working up to your end goals across each practice). If your situation is very brief (e.g., riding four floors on an elevator), then continue practicing over and over again on a given day until you spend about an hour practicing. You will continue to practice a given situation for the number of days necessary for your maximum anxiety level to reduce to 2 or less. Whether your level of anxiety decreases or not within a given practice is not important; what is more important is that over each day of practice, the level of anxiety eventually decreases. Now, we will consider ways of making the practice as as possible. ______________mmm 132 Moment of Fear If you become afraid or nervous during the practice, use your breathing and thinking skills to help you continue to move forward and complete the practice. First, practice breathing by doing the following. Focus your attention on breathing and counting. Count for one second, inhale for two seconds, think the word \"relax\" for one second, and exhale for two seconds. Expand your stomach when you breathe in, and deflate your stomach when you breathe out, keeping your chest relatively still, without taking big breaths. Count up to 10 and back to one, one time. Then, ask yourself the following key questions, so that you can use your thinking skills. What is it that I am most worried about happening? What are the real chances of that happening? What will I do to cope with and manage this situation? Escape If, while you are doing your practice, you feel as if you absolutely have to leave because your fear and anxiety are so intense, the best strategy is to leave the situation temporarily and, after using your skills, return to the situation again. Here are some examples. If you are driving on the freeway, pull off the freeway and find a place to stop. Practice your breathing skills, and ask yourself the same key questions listed above to help you use your thinking skills. Then, get back on the freeway. If you are in a shopping mall, find a place to sit down near the exit or just outside the mall and, after you have used your breathing and thinking skills, return back into the shopping mall. The number-one rule is that if you escape from a situation and do not return to it, you will end up back where you started and will not make progress. So, you must always return to the situation. 133 After the Practice Homework After the practice is completed; rate whether what you were most worried about occurred or not (yes or no); rate your level of maximal anxiety during the practice on a 0-10point scale, where 0 = no anxiety and IO extreme anxiety. Think about what happened, your accomplishments, and what you might do differently next time. Watch out for unhealthy self-criticism. Remember, if you felt anxious as you faced the situation, that is fine-in fact, it is expected, and it is good. Learning is helped by anxiety, especially since t\\\\vo of the most critical things to learn are that anxiety is not harmful and that you can handle anxiety. Also, remember that whether your anxiety decreases within a given practice is not so important; more important is that eventually, over repetitions of days of practice, the anxiety decreases. Finally, remember what you actually accomplished. For example, it is much more helpful to reward yourself for having driven t\\\\vo miles on the freeway than to criticize yourself for not having driven further. It is the accomplishments that are most important, no matter how small the accomplishment may seem to be. ~ Continue recording your panic attacks and daily mood using the Panic Attack Record and Daily Mood Record. At the end of the week, add the number of panic attacks and daily average of anxiety to your Progress Record. ~ Read chapter 9 over the next week to learn about involving family or friends. ~ Practice Changing Your Odds and/or Changing Your Perspective for any panic attacks that occur over this next week. ~ Practice facing an agoraphobia situation at least three times this week.

T F SECTION 2 Review and Continued Planning and Practice Facing Agoraphobia Situations Review of Practicing Facing Agoraphobia Situations What Did You Learn? Did the practices help you to realize that you had been mistakenly jumping to conclusions and/or blowing things out of proportion? Did your practices help you to realize that you can handle fear and anxiety? Did your 136 practices help you to realize that you can accomplish things that you have been avoiding? Of course, these three goals will become more fully realized with continued and repeated practice. Dealing With Escapes Sometimes anxiety feels overwhelming, and you may choose to escape from the situation without returning to it the same day. Treat this as a learning experience, and if you did escape, spend some time now thinking about why. What kind of symptoms did you feel? What kind of negative thoughts were going through your mind? What were you anticipating had you continued with the activity? You were probably jumping to conclusions and/or blowing things out of proportion, in which case, go back to your thinking skills by looking at the evidence and putting things back into perspective. Also, remember that these practices are not supposed to be associated with zero anxiety or fear. That is, you should feel anxious at first, or else there would be no need to do them at all. In fact, some anxiety is critical, as it helps you to learn that the feelings of fear and anxiety are not dangerous in and of themselves and can be handled. Furthermore, sometimes the anxiety increases at first before it decreases, because you are facing things that you have been avoiding. However, with repeated practice, the anxiety will eventually decrease. If your level of anxiety remains high after many repetitions of practicing with the same situation, it may be that you are putting too much focus on trying to prevent yourself from feeling anxious in the situation instead of accepting the anxiety and focusing on your breathing and thinking skills to help you face the situation. Continuing to Plan for and Practice Facing Agoraphobia Situations Choose the next item from your Hierarchy of Agoraphobia Situations, and apply the same principles as described in section 1. Continue doing this for as long as it takes for you to complete all of the items from your hierarchy. 137 Context of First Panic Attack Homework ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ The contexts in which first panic attacks are experienced are likely to carry special significance. For example, let us say that your discomfort about driving began with a panic attack while driving home alone at night to an empry house. Mter that, fears of driving expanded to driving in the day, on surface streets and on freeways. In addition to facing your fear of driving during the day and night, on surface streets and on freeways, it will be particularly important to face your fears of driving under the same conditions in which the first panic occurred; that is, to face the situation of driving home alone at night to an empty house. Similarly, let us say that your first panic attack occurred in a movie theater that was crowded and hot, and when you were suffering from a cold. It would be particularly helpful to face your fears of movie theaters under similar conditions of being crowded, hot, and when you are feeling congested or experiencing other cold symptoms. Continue recording your panic attacks and daily mood using the Panic Attack Record and Daily Mood Record, and at the end of each week, complete your Progress Record. Practice Changing Your Odds and/or Changing Your Perspective for any panic attacks that occur over this next week. Practice facing an agoraphobia situation at least three times a week, continuing until you have practiced all of the items from your hierarchy. You may practice more than one situation from your hierarchy at one time. Consider ways to practice facing agoraphobia situations in the context of your first panic attack. Continue to section 3 once you have completed at least one half of your Hierarchy of Agoraphobia Situations or when you have reached Week 10 of the treatment program. 138 SECTION 3 Facing Physical Symptoms in Agoraphobia Situations Facing Physical Symptoms in Agoraphobia Situations It is conceivable (although unlikely) that you could face all of your agoraphobia situations without ever experiencing a physical symptom that normally distresses you. Think of a woman who is concerned about driving, especially when her arms feel weak because she mistakenly thinks that the weakness means that she is about to lose control of the car. What would happen if she faced the situation of driving the freeways each day without ever feeling weakness in her arms? That would be okay, as long as she never felt the weakness ever again. But that is an unlikely scenario. So, it is best to be prepared for the physical symptoms in agoraphobia situations. You would probably agree that the situations would be easier to deal with if you were guaranteed never to feel the physical symptoms. But that is unrealistic, especially ifyou are at all anxious about the situation; as we know, anxiety brings about symptoms in and of itself In addition, some symptoms will occur regardless of your anxiety, such as the rise in body temperature which may occur in a crowded shopping area, or the eyestrain that may occur due to driving, or the stomach fullness that might occur after eating a meal in a restaurant. It is better to face everything-the symptoms and the situation-rather than to wish that the symptoms will never occur. By this time in the program, you should have completed much of chapter 10, in which you learn to face physical symptoms that make you anxious. Now, it is time to incorporate your work from chapter 10 and accept and even exaggerate the physical symptoms in your practices with agoraphobia situations. Entering a situation with the intention of having physical symptoms is evidence that you do not fear the symptoms. On the other hand, entering a situation with the hope that physical symptoms do not develop is evidence that you still fear the symptoms. There are many ways in which to purposely bring on the physical symptoms as you face different situations: driving your car with the heater on and windows rolled up (heat); wearing woolen clothes, jackets, or turtlenecks (heat); 139 looking behind yourself quickly while walking (dizziness, loss of balance); drinking coffee (racy fielings ); eating pasta or other heavy foods (fUllness ofstomach); walking up Rights of stairs (racing or pounding heart); not wearing sunglasses on a sunny day (rye fatigue); wearing a tie or scarf (tightness around the throat). So, follow the next steps to design your next practice, using the Facing Symptoms and Agoraphobia Situations form. I. IdentifY the situation from your hierarchy that you will practice. It may be a new item that you have not yet practiced; or, if you have practiced all items on your hierarchy, then practice the item rated with the highest anxiety rating again. 2. Choose a symptom that you will intensifY, and decide how and when you will deliberately produce that symptom as you deal with your anxious situation. This is called symptom exaggeration. 3. Think about the best conditions to practice in so that you can truly learn that your negative thoughts are unrealistic. These are called the endgoals. Remember to exclude superstitious objects, safety signals, safety behaviors, and distractions. 4. Choose to either gradually work up to the end goals or go directly to the end goals. If you choose a gradual approach, your today\\'s goals will be different from the end goals. ). IdentifY what it is that you are most worried about happening in this situation while experiencing the symptoms. This is called negative thought. 6. Then apply your thinking skills to the negative thought. (How many times has it happened? What is the evidence? What are the real odds? What are some ways of coping?) 7. After the practice, record whether what you were most worried about occurred, and record your maximal anxiety. 140 Facing Symptoms and Agoraphobia Situations Date: Situation: Symptom Exaggeration: End Goals (excluding superstitious objects, safety signals, safety behaviors, and distractions): Today\\'s Goals: Negative Thought (i.e., whatever it is you are most worried about happening, with the symptoms in the situation): How many times has it happened? What is the evidence? What are the real odds? (??) Ways of coping: Did what I most worried about occur? (Yes/No) Maximal anxiety (?): ?- ? - ? - ? - None Mild Moderate Strong Extreme Homework ~ Continue recording your panic attacks and daily mood using the Panic Attack Record and Daily Mood Record. At the end of the week, add the number of panic attacks and daily average anxiety to your Progress Record. Use Changing Your Odds andlor Changing Your Perspective for any panic attacks that occur over this next week. Practice facing an agoraphobia situation and the symptoms in that situation at least three times this week. You may practice more than one situation from your hierarchy at one time. Continue this practice until you have repeated all of the situations from your Hierarchy of Agoraphobia Situations with all of the symptoms that make you anxious enough times, so that your maximum anxiety is no greater than a score of 2. ~ Once you have completed these practices and all of the material in chapter 10, then move to the final phase of the treatment by reading chapter II, section 2, and chapter 12. 142 Involving Others Goals Understand reasons for including others Plan effective ways for including others In this chapter, we present ways for incorporating others, such as husbands, wives, family, or friends, to help you confront your fears of agoraphobia situations. You may skip this section if there are no others who can assist you in this endeavor or if you prefer to work alone. Why Seek the Help of Someone Else? Research suggests that involving spouses, life partners, family, or friends in the therapy process facilitates a pattern of continuing improvement, especially after formal therapy is over. Therefore, we recommend that you seek the aid of a family member, friend, life partner, or spouse whom you think would be willing to help you. It makes sense when you think about it. First, agoraphobic behavior can impact others in your life. By avoiding situations, certain tasks or chores that used to be yours may need to be taken over by others. Although the other person may be doing this in order to help you out, by taking over your normal activities, they may inadvertently reinforce your fear and avoidance. For example, let us say that to help you with your fear of driving and waiting in lines, your husband now stops at the store on the way home from work to pick up the groceries. In turn, because you do not drive or stand in lines, you do not have the chance to learn to be less afraid of those situations. Furthermore, you may develop a sort of dependence on your husband. That is, you rely on him more and more to take you places and to do the things that you used to do on your own. As you might guess, such dependence brings a whole lot of other 143 problems with it-sometimes resentment on both sides and argumentsall because your husband was initially trying to help you out and you thought that you were doing the right thing. Awareness of these patterns is the first step to change. Another possibility is that your spouse, life partner, family member, or friend may inadvertently reinforce your fear and avoidance by giving a lot of attention to you when you are afraid. If the attention you receive (which is something we all like to receive) is stronger when you are afraid than when you are not afraid, then it makes sense that your fear may become motivated by attention from your spouse or life partner. Of course, you might not be fully aware of this pattern, and it might be subconscious. This is because we all tend to respond to attention by increasing the behavior that produced the attention in the first place. So, let us say that your girlfriend hugs you especially long, or is especially caring for you, when you are anxious or that an argument is immediately forgotten when she learns that you are experiencing distress; it makes sense that, in some way, you learn that such positive attention can be obtained from being anxious. This is certainly not to say that all of your anxiety is designed to receive positive rewards; the cost of anxiety almost always outweighs the benefits. Nevertheless, this type of reinforcement can be a contributing factor, and therefore, one that should be modified. It is even possible for your significant other to find your dependence on him or her as reinforcing for them, so that in the end, he or she takes over more and more of your responsibilities. Another possibility is that, due to their lack of understanding of the nature of panic attacks and agoraphobia, a concerned husband, wife, parent, or friend could exacerbate your own fears by overreacting to or by magnifYing your panic symptoms. For example, a reaction from them of \"Oh, my, we better go to the hospital as soon as possible\" when you tell them that you feel as if you are about to faint might only serve to increase your own distress. Again, awareness of these patterns is the first step to change. At the other end of the scale, your significant other may react to your difficulties with anger, frustration, lack of understanding, and nonsupport. In some ways, this is understandable, since your spouse, life partner, family member, or friend may feel that they have to take on responsibilities and chores that they really do not want to do or that they never expected to do. For someone who already has a busy schedule, taking on extra tasks can be a burden. This situation can be exacerbated when the significant other does 144 not fully understand the nature ofyour problem. They may even make accusations that your problem is not real, that it is all in your head. Having an unsupportive or an accusing parmer will add to your background stress and, in tum, make your progress through the treatments in this workbook a little slower and more difficult. Under these conditions, it is helpful to give the significant other a description of the nature of panic and agoraphobia and of how they are treated. So, as you can see, a balance needs to be achieved betWeen an overly dependent and reinforcing relationship with significant others and being shunned and accused by significant others. Incorporating their help in your progress to recovery is a way of achieving the right balance. By having them involved in your therapy; the significant other (from now on, called the helper or the coach) can become an aid, so that the two of you can work as a problemsolving team in applying all of the principles outlined in this workbook. Ways for Your Helper to Understand Your helper can leam about panic and agoraphobia by reading this workbook, by having a mental health professional explain things to them, or by asking you to explain things to them in as objective a way as possible. The latter is probably the most difficult, since strong emotions may have already been built up between the two of you regarding your panic and agoraphobia and their impact on your relationship. Of course, the helper must have some motivation or willingness to understand and/or help out. Unfortunately, some people may be unwilling, although they may become interested and willing as they see you making progress. The best you can do is to suggest that they either read the workbook or talk to a mental health professional so as to better understand what you are going through. The fact that change would help them, as well as you, is another important concept to convey to your helper. In other words, your relationship will most likely get better when your panic and agoraphobia lessen. The rest of this chapter proceeds as if your significant other has agreed to learn more and become a part of your recovery. In particular, this means that they become a kind of coach or aid when you face agoraphobia situations. 145 Preparation for Working Together Preparation for the two of you to work as a team so as to overcome your panic and agoraphobia involves several steps. The helper should learn about panic and agoraphobia. We recommend that your spouse, life partner, friend, or family member read this workbook. Along with this information is the understanding that YOut panic and agoraphobia are not consciously intentional and that this is not a problem that is \"all in your head\" or that \"everything would be all right if you just pulled yourself together.\" It is important that you recognize the way in which your helper\\'s life has been impacted as the two of you have worked to accommodate agoraphobia. This means having a discussion with your helper and listing the areas of his or her life that have changed as a result of this problem. Of course, the goal of treatment is to alleviate your own distress, as well as any stress that it has placed on your helper. Joint recognition of problem areas is a good way to begin a process of change as a team. Next, in continuing your discussion with your helper, it is helpful to identify which of their behaviors might reinforce your and avoidance, albeit inadvertently. Brainstorm together to identify the reinforcements. In particular, discuss whether your helper gives you the most positive attention at times when you are anxious, as opposed to when you are relatively relaxed. Also, identify which chores or tasks he or she has taken over that used to be yours. Finally, identify ways in which your helper might magnify your physical symptoms by overreacting to them. Reading the beginning section of this chapter might help coaches to realize how their own behaviors could be inadvertently maintaining their loved one\\'s distress. The next step is for your helper to learn about ways of overcoming panic and agoraphobia. In other words, they should understand the breathing and thinking skills for helping you to face agoraphobia situations. Along with this, your helper is to be discouraged from magnifying the experience of panic, such as believing that you are at risk for dying if your heart rate speeds up. Instead, they will begin to help you to use your thinking skills when you are anxious. At the same time, they are encouraged to be supportive and patient, since progress is rarely always smooth, ups and downs occur, and progress is dependent on a great deal of effort and persistence. 146 Ways to Communicate Helpers can become familiar with the thinking skills by reading the relevant sections of the workbook and by prompting you to use your thinking skills in preparation for each time you face agoraphobia situations. In this way, your helper can provide an objective focus that might be helpful to you when examining the evidence and developing alternatives. The next step in preparing to face agoraphobia situations with the direct help of your friend, family member, or life partner is to consider how to communicate when you are in the midst of feeling very anxious. Sometimes, we say things that we do not mean or in ways that we do not intend when feeling distressed. For that reason, it is useful to rehearse the most constructive type of communication before you and your helper head off to face agoraphobia situations. We recommend that you use a Q-ro-point rating system to communicate with each other about your own level of anxiety or distress as a way of diminishing the awkwardness associated with discussion of your feelings, especially in public situations. Furthermore, using a number scale helps to keep you on the track of being objective as opposed to distracting from how you are feeling or, on the other hand, being too subjective. It is much more effective to tell your helper that your anxiety level is a 6 instead of saying \"I feel terrible.\" Similarly, it is much more effective for your helper to ask for a number rating than to ask, \"How bad you are feeling?\" Of course, you may prefer not to let your helper know how anxious you are feeling at all, for reasons of embarrassment or attempts to avoid your anxiety due to the concern that your anxiety will intensifY if you talk about it. Remember, attempts to distract from or avoid your anxiety are not helpful in the long run-it is much better to maintain an objective awareness of your reactions. The initial discomfort and embarrassment about discussing your anxiety with your helper will most likely reduce as the two of you become more familiar with discussing anxiety and its management. Also, significant others should attempt to be neither too insensitive nor too pushy. For example, they may presume to know how anxious you feel or what is going through your mind without asking for confirmation from you. Alternatively, they may become angry or frustrated if you avoid or es147 cape from a situation. Joint discussion in advance about how the helper can best react should you show hesitation or withdrawal is the best way to prevent negative communication during exposure. So, again, take on the issue as a team. Discuss what each person will do if you become very afraid or express an urge to leave. The two of you might decide to use keywords to communicate crucial concepts, especially if in public. For example, consider the following scenario. You: My anxiety is strong-at a 6, I want to leave. HELPER: Thoughts? You: The same old thing-I\\'m hot and sweaty, and I think I\\'m going to faint. HELPER: Jumping to conclusions? You: Yes-but the fielings are stronger than usual. HELPER: How many times? You: I know-I\\'ve neverfainted. HELPER: Sit? You: Yes, let\\'s sit down so that I can think about this. As you can see, the helper was using a few keywords that the couple had worked our beforehand, to prompt the individual suffering from anxiety look at the evidence and develop a coping strategy of sitting down versus escaping the situation. Here is another example. You: I am terrified. HELPER: Number? You: It\\'s a7-1fiellike I can\\'t breathe. HELPER: It\\'s afieling-is it true thatyou cannot breathe? You: I know-I am getting enough air, but it\\'s really difficult. HELPER: Slow breathing? 148 Here is yet another example. You: I don\\'t want to practice today-I am really tired. It\\'s too hard, and I\\'m worn out. HELPER: What were you planning to do today? You: 10 go back to the bank lines. The same one I went to on Monday. I just don\\'t feel up to it today. HELPER: I know it\\'s hard, but it\\'s helping~you can go places that used to be almost impossible flr you. You: Yes~but I just need a rest. HELPER: Are you making any negative predictions about what could happen in the bank line because ofthe wayyou are feeling? You: Probably. I think that I really wouldpass out because I am so tired. HELPER: Okay-what is the evidence? You: I know . .. none. Okay> I will go. Support from the helper is important also. Support means recognizing attempts you make to overcome your fear and avoidance and reinforcing these attempts. This may differ from the usual pattern of reinforcement, which is to give most attention to you when you are in distress. Occasionally, your own success can seem deflated if the significant other in your life does not appreciate how hard you have worked or what a major accomplishment it is for you to initiate an activity that you have been avoiding for a long time. Let us say that you have been wanting to go out to dinner at a restaurant with your partner, something that the both of you used to really enjoy. Finally, you feel ready, and so you mention it to your significant other when he or she comes home from work. However, you partner is tired and refuses to go, suggesting that perhaps you do so another night. While it is understandable that your companion might be tired and not in your mindset at that moment, it is helpful if your partner realizes the significance of your initiative and reinforces your progress by agreeing to eat out, despite personal titedness. On the other hand, it is also important for you to understand that your significant other may not always be as supportive as you would like because of his or her own troubles and concerns. 149 Your Helper as a Coach So with all of this information in mind, you can now proceed to include your helper as a coach when you face agoraphobia situations. The helper may be a coach by discussing the task before you attempt it and after it is over, prompting you to use your thinking skills and breathing, and helping you to evaluate your accomplishments objectively. Also, a coach can accompany you on the task. However, remember that if your helper accompanies you, she or he could become a safety signal. Therefore, it is essential that, eventually, you are able to face the situation on your own, without your spouse, life partner, friend, or family member. An example of how to wean yourself away from your helper gradually follows. Drive 1-90 five exits, with your coach as the driver. Drive 1-90 five exits, with your coach as the passenger. Drive 1-90 five exits, with your coach in a different car, one car in front of you. Drive 1-90 five exits, with your coach in a different car, two cars behind you. Drive 1-90 five exits, with your coach in a different car, one half a mile behind you. Drive 1-90 five exits, meeting your coach at a destination point. Drive 1-90 five exits, without the help of your coach. Homework ~ Return to chapter 8, and continue with planning for and practicing facing agoraphobia situations, either with or without the assistance of your helper. 150 Self-Assessment Answer each of the following by circling T (True) or F (False). Answers are given in the appendix. 1. Family members or friends should never be involved in your treatment, as they will only contribute to the pressure for you to get better. T F 2. It is possible for your agoraphobia to be reinforced by attention from your family or friends or by having them take over your responsibilities. T F 3 If you do have a helper as you face agoraphobia situations, that person should read this workbook, think about the ways in which his or her life has been influenced by your agoraphobia, how he or she may have reinforced your agoraphobia, and learn the breathing and thinking skills.

T F 151  ~haptertO Facing Physical Symptoms Goals To understand the value of facing physical symptoms To learn how to optimally face physical symptoms To review what is learned from facing physical symptoms To continue to face physical symptoms and activities Completing this chapter will take a number of weeks (e.g., six weeks), although the actual amount of time will depend on the number of symptoms and activities that make you anxious and on the pace ofyour progress with those symptoms and activities. SECTION 1 Facing Physical Symptoms Face the Physical Symptoms: Why? As you know by the now, fear of physical symptoms is central to panic disorder. You have been learning to change what you think about the physical symptoms. Now we will face the physical symptoms directly so that you can learn that the symptoms are not harmful; that you can handle the symptoms and the anxiety; and that, eventually, the anxiety about the physical symptoms will decrease. We have discussed how being afraid of physical symptoms leads to more physical symptoms, since the symptoms are the natural result of anxiety and fear. This is part of the panic cycle. 153 More fear Even more fear abollt racing heart More Racing racing heart heart Figure 10.1. Panic Cyde As already mentioned, the reasons why fears of physical symptoms persist include: avoidance behaviors (e.g., doing whatever you can to get rid of the symptoms or avoiding places where you expect the symptoms to arise); mistaken beliefi (e.g., that the physical symptoms mean you are going to die, lose control, or go insane); interoceptive conditioning, where your body has become highly sensitive to the physical feelings of the beginnings of a panic attack. The goal of this part of treatment is to help you directly the physical symptoms that make you anxious (i.e., decrease avoidance), replace your mistaken beliefs with more realistic thinking, and interrupt the conditioning. To do this, we nrst identify which physical symptoms make you feel anxious, using a series of exercises that bring on symptoms similar to those that are typical of anxiety and panic. Next, we repeat the exercises that produce the symptoms enough times and in just the right way so that you learn that the symptoms are not harmful, that you can handle them, and that you can break the conditioning. What normally happens in your day-to day-life is probably very differentyou probably do everything possible to get rid of the physical symptoms, such as lie down, distract yourself by getting engaged in other activities, leave wherever you are, and so on. These actions are really avoidances, and 154 Symptom Assessment they prevent you from learning that the symptoms are not harmful. So, we will do the opposite of what you normally do. First, though, we would like to make a note about medical issues before we continue. Most of the symptom exercises are relatively mild in intensity. You are not being asked to run a marathon. However, they may be too intense for persons with certain medical conditions, which is one of the reasons why we always recommend that a medical evaluation be conducted if you have not had one in the last 12 months. If you do suffer from a medical condition (e.g., epilepsy, high blood pressure) alongside panic disorder, we recommend that you undertake these symptom-induction exercises under the guidance of your medical doctor. For example, have your doctor look at the list of symptom exercises and ask the doctor to indicate which ones are okay for you to do. Similarly, asthmatic sufferers should obtain medical clearance for these exercises, as should women who are pregnant. Here is the list of exercises. 1. Run in place, lifting your knees up as high as you can, for up two minutes, to produce racing heart and shortness of breath. 2. Spin around and around for up to one minute. If you have a chair that swivels, such as a desk chair, this is ideal. Otherwise, stand up and rum around quickly (about one turn every three seconds) to make yourself dizzy. Be near a soft chair or couch to sit on after one minute is up. This will produce dizziness and, perhaps, nausea as welL 3 Overbreathe for up to one minute-that is, breathe deeply and fast, using a lot of force, as if you were blowing up a balloon. Sit as you do this. This exercise produces unreality, shortness of breath, tingling, cold or hot feelings, dizziness or headache, and other symptoms. In fact, you have already done this exercise as part of chapter 6 when evaluating the role of overbreathing in your panic attacks. (Do not do this exercise ifyou have epilepsy, seizures, or cardiopulmonary diseases.) 4. Breathe through a drinking straw for up to 2 minutes. This will produce the feeling of not getting enough air. 155 5. Stare at yourself in a mirror for up two minutes. Stare as hard as you can to produce feelings of unreality. 6. Place your head between your legs for 30 seconds, and then sit up quickly, in order to produce feelings of lightheadedness or a sense of blood rushing away from your head. 7. Tense every part of your body, without causing pain, for up to one minute. Tense your arms, legs, stomach, back, shoulders, faceeverything. This will produce feelings of muscle tension, weakness, and trembling. After each exercise, you will do the following. List all of the symptoms you felt. Rate your anxiety about the symptoms on a 0-10 scale (where 0= none at all, 5 = moderate, and 10 extreme). Rate how similar the symptoms are to the ones you would feel in a natural panic attack on a 0-10 scale (where  not at all similar, and 10 exactly the same). Now, go ahead and attempt each exercise, and complete the Symptom Assessment form on page 157. Here are Jill\\'s responses to each of the standard exercises. I. Running in place: Jill stopped this one after 45 seconds. \"I feel like 1 have to stop-my heart is beating fast, and 1 feel sweaty and out of breath. Usually, 1 try to avoid doing any exercise.\" Jill rated this procedure as producing symptoms that were very intense (8), very similar to what she felt during her panic attacks (7), and, initially, that made her feel quite anxious (6). 2. Spinning: Jill stopped this after 30 seconds. \"Boy, 1 feel really dizzy. The room is spinning-I am spinning. And my heart is racing, and 1 feel sweaty. It\\'s calming down now.\" These symptoms were very intense (9), similar to those she felt when she panicked (7), and they caused some anxiety (5) 3. Hyperventilation: Jill stopped after 25 seconds. \"I feel really hot and sweaty, tingly in my face, lightheaded, and like 1 need to take a deep breath.\" Again, this procedure produced symp156 Symptom Assessment 0- I - 2 n __ 34 -._- () -.-None Exercise Run in place Mild Moderate Symptoms 8 Strong m 9 10 Extreme Anxiety Level 1-10 Similarity 1-10 Spinning Overbreathing Drinking-straw breathing Stare at self in mirror Lift head quickly Tense body Other Other .~~_ ~-_.__..__ -157 toms that Jill rated as being very intense (9), similar to her natural panics (7), and that made her feel very anxious (8). 4 Drinking-straw breathing: Jill stopped after 35 seconds. \"I feel like I can\\'t keep going, I have to take a deep breath.\" Jill rated the symptoms as strong (6), quite similar to her panic-symptoms (4), and making her feel somewhat anxious (5). 5. Staring at herself in the mirror. \"This is weird. It feels a bit like the spacey feelings I get when I\\'m just coming out of a panic attack. I don\\'t like this at alL\" Jill rated the symptoms as being moderate (5), fairly similar to her panic symptoms (4), and causing some anxiety (4). 6. Head lift. \"I feel a little dizzy-and lightheaded. This was not much at alL\" She did not report any fear (0) or much similarity (2), and she rated the symptom intensity as being quite mild (2). 7. Body tension. \"I feel a little shaky and trembly and weak.\" While the symptoms were quite intense for Jill (6), she did not rate them as very productive of anxiety (1), and she rated the similarity as being low (1). Now, look at your own ratings on the Symptom Assessment form. Star (*) the exercises that produced symptoms you rated as at least 2 on the 0-10 scale of similarity. Next, rank the starred exercises in order of the level of anxiety (1 = lowest level of fear, 2 = second lowest level of fear, and so on). We will begin doing repetitions with the exercises that were rated with the least anxiety (instructions follow). If your anxiety ratings were never higher than 2, consider the following possible explanations and solutions. Maybe none of the symptoms of which you are afraid were produced by these exercises. If so, be creative, and come up with other exercises to produce symptoms that are most relevant to you. For example, if you are anxious abour visual symptoms, look at a bright light for 30 seconds, and then look at a blank wall to see the afterimage. Or, if you are afraid of symptoms in your throat, put pressure against the sides of your throat, or press 158 down on the back of your tongue with a pen. Another exercise is to sit in a hot, stuffY room for five minutes. You should know by now which symptoms bother you most, so be creative, and invent some ways to produce them. The goal is to deliberately bring on the symptoms that worry you most, as long as it is safe to do. Add these to the \"other\" category on the Symptom Assessment form, and try them out. Maybe you stopped the exercises too soon in anticipation of strong symptoms. For example, you might have stopped spinning after IO seconds because you were just starting to feel off-balance. If so, then repeat the exercises, and try to go for longer. Maybe you have truly overcome your anxiety of the symptoms as a result of the work you have done so far. If so, we still recommend that you continue with the exercises described below. Overlearning is helpful in the long run. Maybe you feel so safe in the setting in which you performed the exercise that the symptoms did not scare you. If so, try the exercises when alone or in a place where you feel less safe. Some of our patients note that if they had to do the symptom exercises alone, they would be more frightened. When accompanied, they feel safe, because there is help should something go wrong. Note that this fear is based on a mistaken belief that they would indeed be in danger if the symptoms occurred when they were alone. In fact, these exercises are no more dangerous when alone than when accompanied. Maybe the knowledge of where the symptoms came from (i.e., the exercise) and the knowledge that the symptoms will go away when the exercise ends decreased your anxiety. Note that this, too, is based on the mistaken notion that unexplained symptoms are necessarily harmful. In this case, continue with the practices, as they should help you manage your fear of symptoms that do arise for no apparent reason. Repeated Practice With Physical Symptoms The goals of the repeated practice are to learn something new, including: the physical symptoms and anxiety itself are not harmful; you can handle the symptoms and the anxiety. 159 As a result, eventually (although not necessarily immediately), the anxiety about the symptoms will diminish. You will practice with the exercises that you rated as having at least some similarity (at least a 2 on the similarity rating). Of those, begin with the exercise that you rated with the least anxiety on the o-ro-point scale, as long as the anxiety rating is at least 3. (Do not bother practicing ones with an anxiety rating of 2 or less.) If you are using benzodiazepine medications (such as Xanax or Klonopin) on an as-needed basis, the temptation may be to take a pill just before you begin to face your fear of the physical symptoms. This is certainly permissible, especially if the only way you are willing to do the symptom exercises is with the help of the medication. However, it will be essential to eventually face your fear and the symptoms without taking the medication (which is described in chapter II). Remember, the goal of these exercises is not only to face the symptoms but also the fear and anxiety initially produced by the symptoms, so that you can learn that you can handle the symptoms, fear, and anxiety. Medications, especially short-acting potent benzodiazepines, may actually prevent you from experiencing much fear and anxiety, and in that regard, they become a form of avoidance. Here are the rules for the repeated practice with physical symptoms. 1.i Decide what it is that you are most worried about happening as you practice the symptom exercise, and record that next to the Negative Thoughts header on the Facing Symptoms form on page 162. This may be a concrete outcome, such as fainting, or it may be the idea that you will not be able to handle the anxiety. You may photocopy this form from the book or download multiple copies at the Treatments ThatWork website (www.oup.com/us/ttw). 2.i Begin the exercise, and continue the exercise for at least 30 seconds after the point at which you first notice symptoms. By continuing beyond the point of first noticing the symptoms, you are providing yourself with the chance to learn that the symptoms and anxiety are not harmful-just unpleasant-and that you can handle them. 3.i Produce the symptoms as strongly as you can. Do not avoid the symptoms by doing the exercise mildly or with hesitation. For ex160 ample, while spinning, the turning must be continuous, and when overbreathing, make sure that the air is forced out with a lot of pressure and that the breathing rate is fast. 4.i Remain focused on what you are doing and feeling in a matter-offact way. You will use your coping skills of breathing and thinking after each exercise is ended-not during the exercise-because there is not enough time, and it is more important to focus directly on the physical symptoms. 5.i When the time is up, stop the exercise, and then complete the Facing Symptoms form to rate: whether the outcome you were most worried about occurred; your level of anxiety (o-ro) under the section labeled First Exercise. 6.i Now is time to use your coping skills. So, when you finish the exercise, take up to 10 slow, diaphragmatic breaths, and then move into your thinking skills by answering the following questions. What is it that I am most worried about happening What are the real chances of that happening What will I do to cope with these symptoms and anxiety Be aware of negative thoughts, such as \"I have to stop-I can\\'t handle these feelings.\" That is a prediction that you are making which is based on nothing but fear. You can, in fact, handle the symptoms and continue the exercises. If you have thoughts about the symptoms becoming more intense or lasting longer, or about how they might affect the rest of your day, go back to looking at the real odds, facing the worst, and ways of coping. 7.i Wait until your symptoms have abated, and then repeat steps 1-6 two more times. At the end of each repetition, complete the section on your Facing Symptoms form for the second exercise and then for the third exercise. Remember to keep in the mind the goal of these exercises. By facing the symptoms and anxiety, you are learning that the symptoms and anxiety are harmless and that you can handle them. As a result, eventually your anxiety over the symptoms will decrease, and eventually, the symptoms will occur less often in your day-to-day life. (Although there will always be some symptoms-remember, everyone has symptoms some of the time.) 161 Facing Symptoms Symptom exercise: ~ ~_.__ .

Use your thinking skills to help you realize that it does not matter how long the symptoms last, because they are not harmful, and they are tolerable. Anxiously waiting for the symptoms to subside means that you are still worrying about the symptoms. Use the symptom exercises to learn that what you are most worried about in relation to the symptoms does not happen. Practice the first symptom exercise three times each day over the next week.

T F 4 It is best to minimize anxiety by concentrating on slow diaphragmatic breathing and thinking skills as you practice each symptom exercise. T F 5 Facing the symptoms will only make you more afraid. T F Review ofPractice and Continued Practice in Facing Symptoms Your task for last week was to practice facing your fear of symptoms every day. By bringing on the symptoms, did you learn that whatever you were most worried about either did not happen or was something you could cope with and that you could handle the symptoms and the anxiety? Remember to produce the symptoms fully. Also, remember not to distract yourself while you are bringing on the symptoms. An example of distraction would be to think about other things, such as how to manage a difficult situation at home or what to eat for dinner. It is much more helpful to keep a very matter-of-fact attitude in which you are fully focused on what you are doing and on the symptoms that you are producing. Distraction is similar to avoidance, and avoidance is to be prevented. The best way to learn to be less afraid ofsymptoms is to face them directly. Usually, avoidance happens because of the continued mistaken belief that the symptoms are harmful (e.g., \"I don\\'t want to hyperventilate because I\\'m afraid that I will pass out and that no one will be there to help me\"). Remember, the symptoms are not harmful. Examples of indirect avoidance include keeping the symptoms at a very mild intensity by doing the exercises only slightly (e.g., breathing only slightly faster than normal during hyperventilation, or spinning at a very slow pace). Or maybe yOll practiced the symptom exercises only in the 164 presence of someone with whom you feel safe, at times when you felt relaxed, or with the aid of benzodiazepine medications. Either way, these actions represent avoidance. In the end, it will be essential for you to face the symptoms and the anxiety directly, even at very intense levels, or when alone, or at times when already feeling anxious, or without the influence of benzodiazepines, because these are the conditions in which symptoms happen in normal day-to-day life, now or in the future. Continue to Face Symptoms From your Symptom Assessment list, progress to the starred (*) exercise that you rated with the next-highest level of anxiety. Practice facing that symptom, remembering the following rules. 1.i After you have identified what it is that you are most worried about with the particular symptom exercise (whether that be something concrete, such as fainting, or the idea of not being able to handle the anxiety), begin the exercise. 2.i Continue the exercise for at least 30 seconds after the point at which you first notice symptoms. By continuing beyond the point of first noticing the symptoms, you are providing yourself with a chance to learn that the symptoms are not harmful-just unpleasant. 3.i Produce the symptoms as strongly as you can. Do not avoid the symptoms by doing the exercise mildly or with hesitation. 4.i Remain focused on what you are doing and feeling in a matter-offact way. You will use your coping skills of breathing and thinking after each exercise is ended-not during the exercise. 5.i When the time is up, stop the exercise, and then rate: whether the outcome you were most worried about occurred; your level of anxiety (0-10) under the section labeled First Exercise. 6.i Now is the time to use your coping skills. So, when you finish the exercise, take up to 10 slow, diaphragmatic breaths, and then move into calm thinking by answering the following questions.

T F 2.i Stop the symptom exercises when your maximum anxiety is no higher than 5. T F 166 3.i The purpose of facing the symptoms is to become less anxious about the symptoms, but it is not to eliminate the symptoms. T F SECTION 3 Facing Symptoms in Activities Facing the Fear Out There: Activities Up until now, your efforts have been directed at artificial exercises, such as hyperventilation and spinning-activities that are not common in day-today life. Now, it is time to move to more common activities that you have feared or avoided because of the physical symptoms they cause. Examples include: drinking coffee (because of the stimulant effect), eating chocolate (because of the stimulant effect), aerobic activity (because of the cardiovascular effect), lifting heavy objects (because of the heightened blood pressure and dizziness effects), and so on. A more comprehensive list is provided below in the Activities Hierarchy. As you look through the items on this list, you may realize that you have been avoiding these types of activities, and only now is the reason dear-because these activities bring on bodily symptoms that remind you of panic attacks. Rate each activity from a to ra, where 0 = no anxiety at all and IO = extreme anxiety. Any activities that you rated as 3 or above will now be part of your Activities Hierarchy, and, as with the symptom exercises up until now, the goal is to repeat each activity as many times as needed to learn that the symptoms are not dangerous (i.e., that whatever you are most worried about never happens or rarely happens and that you can cope with whatever happens) and that the symptoms and anxiety can be handled. You will know this when the next time you practice a given activity, the maximum anxiety level is 2 or less. This takes a lot of work, because these activities often take more time than the symptom exercises. However, the more you put into it, the more you will improve. Also, there is a difference between the symptom exercises and some of the activities that you are just beginning. With the symptom exercises, the symp167 Activities Hierarchy Activity Anxiety (0-10) Running up flights of stairs Walking outside in intense heat Attending meetings in hot, stuffY rooms Driving in hot, stuffY cars Shopping in hot, stuffY stores or shopping malls Walking outside in very cold weather Participating in aerobics Lifting heavy objects Dancing Engaging in sexual relations Watching horror movies Eating heavy meals Watching exciting movies or sporting events Getting involved in \"heated\" debates Showering with the doors and windows closed Using a sauna Hiking Playing sports Drinking coffee or other caffeinated beverages Eating chocolate Standing quickly from a sitting position Getting angry Riding fairground or amusement park rides Snorkeling Taking antihistamines or other over-the-counter medications Looking up at the sky and clouds Drinking diet cola and other sodas Reading while a passenger in a car For persons who frequently panic out ofsleep: Deep meditative relaxationi Fatigue from staying up late several nights in a rowi Alcohol or antihistaminesi Abrupt wakening from sleep by an alarm that goes off in the middle of the nighti Hot sleeping conditions due to central heating, windows closed, no air conditioning ori fans, on warm nights, or from wearing warm clothes to bedi 168 toms generally build up quiddy after starting the exercise and subside quickly after you stop the exercise. This not always true with the activities. For example, symptoms may not come on right away after drinking coffee because it takes time for caffeine to have its peak effect (about 45 minutes). Similarly, the symptoms may not go away immediately after drinking coffee. The important point to keep in mind is that even though you do not know exactly when symptoms will come and go, the symptoms are not harmful. Facing Your Own Activities Choose the activity that you rated about 3 in terms of anxiety, and then follow the steps below. I.i Identify what it is that you are most worried about happening in this activity. This is called Negative Thought. As with the Facing Symptom exercises, this might be a concrete outcome, such as dying or fainting, or it might be the idea that you cannot handle the anxiety associated with the activity. 2.i Think about the best conditions in which to practice, so that you can truly learn that YOut negative thoughts are unrealistic (these are called End Goals). For example, let us say that your task is to have a shower with the windows and doors closed, so that the room fills up with steam. In the past, you may have avoided doing this because the steam led you to feel a sense of suffocation. So, the plan might be to close the doors and windows before you turn on the water, run the hot water for a few minutes before you get into the shower, and then stay in the shower for a particular period of time, such as 10 minutes, even if you feel a sense of suffocation. (Remember, a sense of suffocation does not mean that you are actually suffocating.) Then, get out of the shower, and dry off in the steamy room for a couple of minutes before opening the door. Another example is deciding to overcome your fear of hot, stuffY areas. In the past, you have avoided wearing heavy clothes, especially in crowded places such as shopping malls. So, your goal is to wear a coat or a thick sweater in an already warm malL 169 Facing Activities (1) Date: _ Activity: -\\'-\"\\'-\"rJ+I.!1f?\"~_ - ~...... ..  -......  ..

Example of Part of Completed Facing Activities Form (I) As with facing agoraphobia situations, learning that your negative thoughts are unrealistic will require that you let go of all superstitious objects, safety signals, safety behaviors, or distractions. So, go back to your lists of Superstitious/Safety Signals and Safety Behaviors/ Distractions from chapter 4, and plan for evenrually practicing each activity without anything on those lists. 3.i Choose either gradually to work up to the End Goals of the activity or to go directly to the End Goals of the activity. For example, let us say that your plan is to drink a cup of coffee, and you decide to take a gradual rather than a direct approach. Therefore, your first step is to drink a full cup of decaffeinated coffee, since usually you avoid even the small amounr of caffeine in decaffeinated brews. The next step is to drink a mixture of decaffeinated and caffeinated coffee. Finally, you drink a fuB cup of caffeinated coffee. Or, if you wanted to take a direct approach, you could just go straight to drinking a full cup of caffeinated coffee. Today\\'s Goals are the conditions in which you will practice on a given day as you work toward your End Goals. In preparation for the practice, ask yourself the following questions. Has what you are most worried about ever happened? (If it has not happened or rarely has, then you are jumping to conclusions.) What is the worst that can happen, and how would you cope with it? (If the worst feels unbearable and you feel as if you could not cope, then you are blowing things out of proportion.) - ~- 170 Facing Activities (2) What are the real odds? (0-100): _.\"\"~\"\" _ Figure 10.3.i Example of Part of Completed Facing Acriviries Form (2)i Then: a. look at all the evidence; b. consider the real odds; c. realize that the worst is probably not as bad as you first thought; and d. think of ways of coping. This activity is to be practiced at least three times over the next week (either going straight to your End Goals or gradually working up to your End Goals across each practice). If your situation is very brief (e.g., looking up at the clouds moving across the sky), then continue practicing over and over again on a given day until you spend about one hour practicing. You will continue to practice a given activity the number of days necessary for your maximum anxiety level to reduce to 2 or less. Whether your level of anxiety decreases or not within a given practice is not important; what is more important is that over each day of practice, the level of anxiety eventually decreases. Now, we will consider ways of making the practice as effective as possible. Moment of Fear If you become afraid or nervous during the activity, manage your anxiety so that you can continue the activity by first using your breathing skills. Focus your attention on breathing and counting. Count for one second, inhale for two seconds, think the word \"relax\" for one second, and exhale for two seconds. 171 Incomplete Practice After the Practice Expand your stomach when you breathe in, and deflate your stomach when you breathe out, keeping your chest relatively still, without taking big breaths. Count up to 10 and back to I, one time. Then, ask yourself the following key questions so that you can begin your thinking skills. What is it that I am most worried about happening? What are the real chances of that happening? What will I do to cope with and manage this situation? Remember, the goal of the breathing and thinking skills is not to eliminate the symptoms or the anxiety but to help you to continue moving forward in facing your fears and completing the activity. If, while you are doing your activity, you feel as if you absolutely have to leave because yout fear and anxiety are so intense, the best strategy is to leave the activity temporarily and, after you have used your coping skills, return to the activity again. So, for example, if you are in an aerobics class, you may leave the class in order to practice breathing, ask yourself the same key questions listed above to help you to use your thinking skills, and then return to the class. Or, if you are dancing, hiking, or looking up at the sky and clouds, you may take a break, use your breathing and thinking skills, and then return to the activity. (Of course, there will be some activities from which it will be impossible to temporarily leave.) The number-one rule is that if you escape from an activity and do not return to it, you will end up back where you started and not make progress. So you must always return to the activity. After the practice is completed: rate whether what you were most worried about occurred or not (yes or no); 172 Facing Activities Date: _i Activity: _i End Goals (excluding supetstitious objects, safety signals, safety behaviots, and distractions): _i Today\\'s Goals: _i Negative Thought (i.e., whatever it is you are most worried about happening): _i How many times has it happened? _i What is the evidence? _i What are the real odds?

You may photocopy this form from the book or download multiple copies at the Treatments That~rk1M website (www.oup.com/uslttw). Jill\\'s activities for her first two weeks were to attend a fitness class (IO minutes each time, first with a friend and then alone) and to have a shower with the curtain drawn and the door closed. The first time she attended a fitness class, she was very anxious before the class but practiced slow breathing and reminded herself that although she may feel out of breath, hot, sweaty, and a suffering from a pounding heart, she was not in danger. As soon as the class started, Jill wanted to leave, but then she realized that by going at her own pace, she could handle the feelings, and so she stayed for the full IO minutes. After the first practice, it became easier, and Jill stayed for longer periods in the class. Then she went to class alone. Her fears in the shower were related to negative thoughts about suffocating from a lack of air. She gradually increased the length of time in the steamy shower room. As with the symptom exercises, the use of medication has to be considered: particularly, medications that either block all of your feelings or that you rely on to reduce your fear at the moment. (The latter are the fast-acting medications, such as Xanax and Klonopin.) If medications are so potent that they block all feelings, then they may interfere with the benefits that you can receive from facing your fear. That is, some anxiety is very helpful-we learn more when we are anxious in comparison to when we are completely relaxed. Also, it is important to learn that physical symptoms and fear and anxiety are not harmful. So, if your anxiety and panic are completely blocked by medications, it may be helpful to talk with your prescriber about lowering the dosage of your medication. The second issue concerns the use of fast-acting medications. Initially, when you first face activities that bring on bodily symptoms, you may feel the need for Xanax or Klonopin, because those medications have been your usual coping tool. That is okay, as long as you eventually become comfortable enough so that you can do these activities without the fast-acting medi174 General Issues Homework Self-Assessment cations. That way, you will really get the chance to learn that the bodily symptoms produced by the activity are not harmful. Ways of weaning off medications are described in chapter 11. Some of the activities will take special planning, and it may take some time to accomplish all of the activities on your list. However, it is important to practice regularly-do not put it offi Given the timing issues, it sometimes makes sense to work on two activities at one time. For example, you could exercise every second or third day, building up your fitness level, while at the same time practice getting used to steamy showers once or twice a day. ~ Continue recording your panic attacks and daily mood using the Panic Attack Record and Daily Mood Record.

T F 5i I should continue the activity with the aid of breathing and thinking skills, even if I experience symptoms. T F SECTION 4 Review and Planningfir Continued Facing Activities Reminder of the Value of Facing Activities As a reminder, the purpose of the activity practices is for you to learn that the symptoms that are produced by these activities are not harmful, that you can handle the symptoms and the anxiety, and that you can accomplish something you have been avoiding. Consequently, your anxiety over the activities will eventually decrease. Review of Practicing Facing Activities Did you practice an activity at least three days last week? If you have not practiced regularly, we encourage you to make these practices a priority. It takes effort, but the more effort you expend, the more benefit that you will gain. Remember to keep records of your practices on your Facing Activities form, so that you can learn that the symptoms produced by the activity are not harmful and that you can handle the symptoms and the anxiety. Eventually, with repetition, your anxiety will decrease. Did you try one of your activities, become frightened, and escape? For example, did you sit in a sauna and leave as soon as you felt too hot, or did you stop drinking from your cup of coffee after the first sip or two? If so, then spend some time thinking about why. What led to your escape? What 176 Continued Facing Activities Homework ~ ~ ~ kind of symptoms did you feel? What kind of negative thoughts were going through your mind? What catastrophe were you anticipating had you continued with the activity? After identifYing the mistaken negative thought, look at the evidence, and put things back into perspective. Then, repeat the activity so that you can confirm that the symptoms it causes are harmless. Let us say that you left an aerobics class before the designated time. After some thought, you realize that you left because you thought your heart rate was far too fast, that it was reaching a dangerously high speed, and that you might pass out or collapse. Then you looked at the evidence and realized that heart rates are supposed to go fast when people exercise; that it probably was not going as fast as you thought; and that even if it was going very fast, the chances of passing out or collapsing were very slim. After that kind of analysis, you felt more able to go back and complete the aerobics class. Remember that these practices are not supposed to be associated with zero anxiety or fear. That is, you should feel afraid at first, or else there would be no need to do them at all. Furthermore, sometimes the fear increases at first before it decreases, because you are facing things that scare you. However, with repeated practice, the anxiety will eventually decrease. Continue to practice with each activity that you rated with an anxiety level of 3 or higher in section I, using the steps outlined in section I. Continue recording your panic attacks and daily mood using the Panic Attack Record and Daily Mood Record. At the end of the week, add the number of panic attacks and daily average anxiety to your Progress Record. Practice either Changing Your Odds and/or Changing Your Perspective for any panic attacks that occur over this next week. Practice each activity at least three days a week, and continue to do so until your anxiety rating on a given day is no more than 2. You may work on more than one activity at a time. 177 Self-Assessment Answer each of the following by circling T (True) or F (False). Answers are given in the appendix.

T F 178 Chapter 11 Medicationsi Goals SECTION 1 To learn about medications for anxiety and panic To learn ways in which medications can be used in combination with the methods outlined in this program To learn ways of weaning yourself off medications Medications for Anxiety Many people with anxiety and panic attacks have had doctors prescribe medications. If this is true for you, you may take this medication regularly or perhaps only when you feel you need it. Many people go through this program without ever starting medication; others would just as soon not take the medication but are doing so on the advice of their physicians. However, there are a number of people who want medication for their anxiety and/or panic attacks. For some, the anxiety and panic are so severe that they feel they cannot handle even one more day and need relief as soon as possible. Even the medication that takes the longest to act would begin to take effect in three weeks. Some of the shorter-acting medications can work within a day or two. Others may not feel that they have the time to devote to mastering the information in this workbook right now. Still others may believe strongly that medication is the best treatment for their anxiety. In any case, almost Go!i, of the people who come to our clinic for psychological treatment are taking some kind of medication for their anxiety. Some have been taking it for quite some time. For others, their physician has given them a prescription to get them through a few weeks but has told them to come to our clinic as soon as possible. 179 How Do Medications Work? As we mentioned in chapter I, we do not recommend that these people stop taking their medications before starting the program. Eventually, many people stop taking medication on their own. About one half of the people stop taking medications by the time they finish this program, and others stop sometime during the first year after finishing. Below, we describe ways to stop taking medications if you want to do so. At this point, the evidence seems clear that some types of medications, if prescribed at the right dosage, can be effective for at least the short-term relief of anxiety or panic for some people. Many of these medications, however, are not effective in the long term unless you continue to take them. Even then, they may lose some of their effectiveness unless you learn some new, more helpful methods of coping with your anxiety and panic while you are on the medication. Nevertheless, there are some people who begin a course of medication therapy and stop several months later without any need to go through a program such as this. Whether the particular stress they were under has resolved, whether there were some changes in their sensitivity, or whether they developed a different attitude toward their anxiety and panic, medication for this short time was all they needed. For all of these reasons, it seems useful to review the ways in which medications work and the different types of medications prescribed for anxiety and panic. Medications are believed to decrease vulnerability to experiencing panic and anxiety. Medications seem to make it harder for the body to have a full fear reaction. In addition, medications reduce general anxiety and, therefore, reduce the severity of daily worry about panic attacks. Because the symptoms of general anxiety are reduced, there are fewer symptoms to become afraid of in a \"fear of fear\" cycle. Medications decrease panic and anxiety by changing the proportions of neurotransmitters (i.e., chemicals) in certain parts of your brain and nervous system. This process of adjustment in the brain chemistry often takes several weeks, which is why many medications do not work immediately (although some do). During this adjustment, the brain \"rebalances\" itself. Therefore, medication is not giving your brain something extra that it lacks, 180 nor is it taking away something that the brain has too much of. Rather, it is helping your brain rebalance and work more efficiently doing the job it has to do. Imagine that the brain has a stress \"thermostat\" that keeps it in balance, like a thermostat keeps a room the same temperature when the temperature gets too hot or too cold. Panic and anxiety may occur when the \"set point\" that determines the ideal level (i.e., temperature) gets moved too high or too low. For example, stress can move the set point. 50 can certain substances, such as caffeine. The process of rebalancing moves the set point back to the middle so that the brain can work more like it has before. After some time, medication may no longer be needed, provided that you can develop better ways of coping with stress so that future stressful events do not move the thermostat set point out of balance again. Different Types of Medications Antidepressants There are several classes of antidepressants which control anxiety and panic attacks. Antidepressants called serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) include medications such as fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), fluvoxamine (Luvox), and paroxetine (Paxil). Related antidepressants called serotonin-norepinepherine reuptake inhibitors (5NRIs) include venlafaxine (Effexor) and serzone (Nefazodone). These two classes of medications have become first-line dtug treatments for panic disorder. In general, they are less toxie and cause fewer side effects than older medicarions such as tricyclic antidepressants and monamine oxidase inhibitors (described next). Nevertheless, some people still experience stomach upset and other gastrointestinal symptoms, headaches, and other side effects-particularly, sexual dysfunction-with these medications. In addition, there may be some initial worsening of anxiety, although this can be decreased by starting with lower doses (such as 5 mg of Prozac). The most effective doses for controlling panic and anxiety for drugs most often prescribed are 20-40 mg of Prozac, 75-150 mg of Luvox, 20-40 mg of Paxil, and 100-200 mg of Zoloft (see Table ILl). Tricyclic antidepressanrs include imipramine (Tofranil), clomipramine (Anafranil), desipramine (Norpramin), nortriptyline (Pamelor), and amitripty181 line (Elavil). Tofranil was formerly the most commonly used antidepressant for anxiety and panic but has been largely supplanted by 55RIs, as noted above. These medications are generally helpful for panic and anxiety when administered in the range of 150-300 mg of Tofranil or its equivalent. There may be some worsening of anxiety initially. However, the initial worsening is only small when beginning with small doses (such as 10 mg of Tofranil). These doses are gradually increased to effective levels. Also, the initial worsening goes away after the first week or so of treatment. Other side effects include dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, weight gain, and lightheadedness. However, these side effects are generally harmless and go away after a few weeks. It usually takes several weeks before the medications control anxiety and panic. So, getting through the first few weeks is critical. It is difficult because the first few weeks are when the side effects are the strongest, but the medication is not yet having a positive effect on reducing panic and anxiety. Mter that, the side effects decrease, and so do panic and anxiety. Another type of antidepressant medication is the monoamine-oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. The best-known medication in this category for anxiety and panic is phenelzine (Nardil). Others include tranylcypromine (Parnate) and isocarboxazid (Marplan). MAO inhibitors can cause side effects such as lightheadedness, weight gain, muscle twitching, sexual dysfunction, and sleep disturbance. A5 with other medications, treatment usually begins with low doses, such as 15-30 mg per day of Nardi!, and is gradually increased to effective levels, such as 60-90 mg per day of Nardil. The MAO inhibitors are seldom used for panic disorder these days because there are severe dietary restrictions when on this medication. For example, you cannot eat cheese, chocolate, or other foods containing tyramine, and you cannot drink red wine or beer. If you do, you risk dangerous symptoms, including high blood pressure. The antidepressant medications seem to be about equally effective for panic attacks, anxiety, and agoraphobia. One thorny problem with antidepressant medications is the side effects during the first few weeks. In addition, the side effects are sometimes similar to symptoms of panic and anxiety. For that reason, many people do not want to continue taking the antidepressant or at least do not want to increase the dosage to the levels that are needed to reduce panic and anxiety (this is called the therapeutic dosage). And yet, research has shown that it is important to take enough of this medication 182 Benzodiazepines to get the full benefits. Therefore, it is best to stick it out through the first few weeks until reaching the therapeutic dosage. To help you stick it out, remember the following. 1.i Side effects are not an indication of something wrong or harmful happening to your body. That is, the side effects do not indicate that physical damage is occurring to your body. Nor do they indicate a physical disease. In fact, side effects indicate that medications are having their intended chemical effects. 2.i Side effects are not an indication that your anxiety is increasing. Instead, side effects indicate that your body is going through a period of adjustment to the medication, and sometimes, the side effects of this adjustment are symptoms that are similar to panic anxiety-but they are not actual panic and anxiety. 3.i Side effects usually go away after a few weeks. 4.i Strategies described in this treatment will help you to be less afraid of the side effects and achieve therapeutic dosages of medication. It is much easier to stop taking antidepressants than benzodiazepines (described below). In other words, there are usually fewer withdrawal symptoms when antidepressants are ended than when benzodiazepines are ended. Therefore, the relapse rates are much lower for antidepressants (around 4-50%) than for benzodiazepines. Medications commonly prescribed for anxiety and panic in the past, but less frequently now, are the minor tranquilizers. Two of the most common are diazepam (Valium) and chlordiazepoxide (Librium). Typically, these medications are prescribed for short-term relief of anxiety. They are generally believed to be unhelpful for panic attacks unless they are prescribed in very high dosages. For example, you might need 30 mg or more of Valium per day to make a dent in your panic attacks. At this dosage, chances are that you would feel very sedated (i.e., sleepy). For this reason, minor tranquilizers are not usually prescribed for panic attacks by psychiatrists and physicians knowledgeable in the medication treatment of panic. Also, over time, you may need increasingly larger dosages of the medication to obtain ~-~~ 183 the same effects. This is called tolerance. Unless you work carefully with your physician, there is a danger that with long-term usage, you may become psychologically and physically dependent on medication (Le., suffer addiction) that had been intended only for short-term treatment of anxiety. High-potency medications have stronger effects per dose than lower-potency medications. High-potency benzodiazepines alleviate panic attacks without causing such side effects as extreme sleepiness, which are seen with higher doses of lower-potency benzodiazepines (e.g., Valium). These medications work very quickly; their effects are usually noticeable within 20 minutes of ingestion and are still the most frequently prescribed medications for panic and anxiety. The best-known high-potency benzodiazepines are alprazolam (Xanax) and clonazepam (Klonopin). To give you an idea of how strong Xanax is, I mg of Xanax equals approximately IO mg of Valium. The therapeutic dose of Xanax for panic attacks varies from person to person and also with the nature of the panic attacks. Usually, 1-4 mg per day would be the best dosage for panic attacks, but a dosage of more than 4 mg per day is sometimes required for sevete agoraphobia avoidance. With these doses, 60% of a large group of patients were free of panic after eight weeks. The appropriate dose of Klonopin is I.5-4 mg per day. Side effects of these medications include sleepiness, poor coordination, and memory problems. However, starting with low doses and gradually increasing over time can reduce these side effects. The initial feeling of sleepiness usually subsides as one adapts to the medication. It is important to realize that the side effects decrease over time and are not dangerous. The different benzodiazepines differ in how long they remain active in your body. This is referred to as half-life (or, the amount of time it takes for one half of a dose of medication to be eliminated from the body). With longer half-life, medication is taken less frequently. Klonopin has a longer half-life (15-50 hours) than Xanax (12-15 hours). Therefore, Klonopin is taken less frequently than Xanax. With a medication of shorter half-life, people often feel the effects of the medication wearing off and notice increased anxiety when the levels of medication in the body are low, such as when wake in the morning. Benzodiazepines are believed to work by increasing the effect of a chemical in the brain called gamma amino butyric acid (GABA). GABA is dis184 Beta-Blockers tributed throughout the brain. It functions to inhibit the firing of nerve cells. Benzodiazepines help GABA to \"put the brakes on\" those areas of the brain which cause anxiety. As you can probably imagine, stopping benzodiazepines will \"let up on the brakes\" and is usually associated with an increase in anxiety. This is one reason why many (if not most) people relapse when they stop benzodiazepines. Withdrawal symptoms are felt when benzodiazepines are stopped. These include anxiety, jitteriness, difficulty concentrating, irritability, sensitivity to light or sound, muscle tension or aching, headaches, sleep disturbance, and stomach upset. Sometimes these withdrawal symptoms lead people to become very concerned and anxious, especially because the withdrawal symptoms are similar to symptoms of panic and anxiety. People are sometimes so upset by the withdrawal symptoms that they begin the medication again in order to get rid of the withdrawal symptoms. Alternatively, they may relapse (i.e., suffer a recurrence of panic and anxiety). Relapse is especially likely if the withdrawal symptoms are mistakenly viewed as being harmful. Actually, most withdrawal symptoms are not harmful. Instead, withdrawal symptoms reflect the body\\'s adjustments to the chemical changes. Also, withdrawal symptoms go away with time. With this type of information and some other behavioral strategies, the withdrawal process is generally much easier. Thus, slow tapering offof benzodiazepines, combined with the types of strategies described in this workbook, dramatically reduces withdrawal and relapse when benzodiazepines are discontinued. Many people take beta-blockers to reduce blood preSSute or regulate heart rate. These medications act on a specific receptor, the beta-receptor, which is involved in regulating aspects of body functioning such as heart rate. Therefore, if one needs to avoid physical tension for medical reasons, betablockers are often used. There are many types of beta-blockers, but the most popular is propranolol (Inderal). Given the information about the psychological factors involved in panic disorder, especially the notion of anxiety focused on physical symptoms of fear, one would think that any medication that decreases bodily symptoms such as fast heart rates would eliminate panic attacks. But there is little if any evidence that Inderal is useful in any way for panic attacks, although some people might a little 185 Table 11.1.

For that reason, doctors knowledgeable about the medication treatment of anxiety almost never prescribe this as the main medication to treat anxiety and panic. It is sometimes included as an adjunct or secondary medication. Medications with indications approved by the Food and Drug Administration for panic disorder are listed in Table ILl, along with additional medications that, although not specifically approved, are likely to be just as effective in certain instances for some people. As always, your physician should work with you in making the final decisions on which medication is best for you. 186 SECTION 2 Stopping }Our Medication Now that you have finished this program, you should be ready to stop your medication, if you wish to do so. If this is a particularly difficult problem for you, an additional brief program for stopping medications with proven effectiveness is available from the Treatments ThatWork series available from Oxford University Press called Stopping Anxiety Medication. Be very sure that you stop your medication under the supervision of your physician; only your doctor can decide how quickly it will be safe for you to taper off your medication to the point where you can stop it altogether. This will be particularly true for medications like Xanax, which are best tapered off very slowly. With what you have learned from this program, you should have little trouble stopping your medication if you follow these general guidelines. 1.i Withdraw from your medication relatively slowly. Do not try to do it all at once. Once again, your physician will be able to give you the best advice on how fast is best for you. 2.i Set a target date for stopping your medication. Once again, this will have to be planned with your physician, so make it a reasonable date in view of your own tapering-off schedule. On the other hand, the date should not be too far away. Generally, the quicker, the betteras long as it is within a schedule that is safe for you, as determined by your physician. 3.i Use the principles and coping skills that you have learned in this workbook as you withdraw from the medication. The reason that we have not addressed this topic until now is because it is important for you to learn how to master your anxiety and panic before successfully stopping medication. One reason for this is that you may begin to experience anxiety and panic at more intense levels as you come offthe medication. Ifyou were never on medication, you should have mastered panic and anxiety by now. If you are on medication, the principles you have learned will need to be applied again to deal with some increased anxiety and panic as you come off medication. Once again, most people do not find this a problem and gradually reduce their medication as they become more comfortable in dealing with their anxiety and panic. 187 Homework If your anxiety and panic seem to be increasing as you decrease your medication dose, it is most likely due to mild withdrawal symptoms. The symptoms simply reflect your body readjusting to the chemical changes of having the medication withdrawn. The withdrawal symptoms do not mean that you must go back on the medication, nor do they mean that something is seriously wrong with you. Instead, the withdrawal symptoms mean a period of adjustment, and they should last only a week or two (in rare cases, a little longer), until the medication clears from your system. In addition, you now have the skills to handle these symptoms. This is a perfect opportunity to use your skills of breathing, relaxing, looking at the evidence, and putting things back into perspective. In this way, withdrawal from medication can be seen as the last item on your list of activities described in chapter 10. That is, withdrawing from medication is another way to produce physical feelings of which you are, or at least were, afraid. Therefore, medication withdrawal can be added to your list of activities, and it can be treated as an opportunity to practice breathing and looking at the evidence to avoid jumping to conclusions and putting things back into perspective about the withdrawal symptoms. Rather than becoming distressed at the physical feelings that you experience as you withdraw from medications, follow the guidelines in chapter 10 for learning to be less afraid of them. After you withdraw from medications, it is very important that you face all of the symptoms, activities, and situations that you faced while on the medication. If you are on medication and wish to withdraw, then your assignment for this week is to speak with your prescribing physician about the best way to do so. Plan how you will deal with any of the withdrawal symptoms by using the various skills that you have learned in this program. Draw up a specific step-by-step plan for yourself. 188 Self-Assessment Answer each of the following by circling true (1\\') or false (F). Answers can be found in the appendix. 1.i It is essential that withdrawal from medication is conducted gradually, under the supervision of your prescribing physician. l\\' F 2.i You are unlikely to feel any different when you withdraw from your medication. l\\' F 3.i Use physical symptoms, anxiety, or panic that you experience when withdrawing from medication as an opportunity to breathe slowly from the abdomen, change mistaken beliefs, and face your fear.

T F 189  Chaptet 12 Goals Evaluate Your Progress Accomplishments, Maintenance, and Relapse Prevention Evaluate your progress Learn how to structure continued practice Ways of maintaining progress High-risk times and management of setbacks It is time to consider the kind of changes that you have made since you first began this program. This can be done in several ways. Using your Progress Record, compare the frequency of panic attacks from the beginning to this point, and examine the course of change throughout the program. There may indeed be ups and downs. Also, compare the severity of your daily anxiety from the beginning to now. If the frequency of your panic attacks and/or the severity of your anxiety have decreased, check YES next to the item labeled panic and anxiety in the list below. If not, check NO. Second, look at your thoughts. Have you made significant changes in the ways you think about panic, anxiety, and the physical symptoms? In other words, are you much less likely to jump to conclusions and to blow things out of proportion, particularly when it comes to panic and the physical symptoms of panic? If so, then check the YES box for the item labeled Negative Thoughts. If not, check NO. Third, look at your initial fear ratings for your hierarchies of symptoms and activities. Now, rate your current level of fear of the same symptoms and activities, using the same o-IO-point scale (where 0 no fear and 10 extreme fear). Are you able to handle physical symptoms produced by hyperventilation, spinning, holding your breath, exercising, drinking 191 Progress Evaluation Evaluate your own progress since you began this program. Panic and Anxiety Significant reduction in frequency of panic, severity of panic, or level of anxiety about panic. DYes DNo Negative Thoughts Significant reduction in jumping to conclusions and blowing things out of proportion. DYes DNo Symptom and Activity Exercises Significant reduction in \"fear of symptom induction\" exercises and activities. DYes DNo Agoraphobia Situations Significant reduction in fear and/or avoidance of situations associated with panic. DYes DNo coffee, or watching a horror movie with much less fear than the first time you rated these various exercises? If there has been a significant reduction in your fear of these items, check YES next to the item labeled Symptoms and Activities. If not, check NO. Fourth, look at your initial fear ratings for your Hierarchy of Agoraphobia Situations. Now, rate your current level of fear of the same situations using the Q-1O-point scale (where 0 no fear and 10 extreme fear). Are you able to consider driving, flying, being alone, being away from home, and so on with much less fear than when you first rated these situations? If so, check YES next to the item labeled Situations. If not, check NO. If you have checked the YES box for at least three of the four items, you may consider that you have done very well with this program. If, on the other hand, you have checked NO to three or more items, there is still room for gains to be made. What to Do Next You may have a number of activities or situations to practice. Use the Practice Plan on page 194 to list all of the things to be practiced over the next few weeks in terms of: 192 Practice Plan Things to Practice Description Breathing Skills Move- PYJlu+!U/ vdvY11ins fad; <hallow bve-athins bad::. to a dow and abdorYlinal Thinking Skills Facing Agoraphobia Situations I arYl ve-ad4 to dVlve- ovt to v\\'/(it rYl4 birothu Facing Symptoms FV<h rYl4<df havdeY\" in ue-vcd<e- vla<(,; I arYl holdln5 bad::. too rYlvu, Figure 12.1.

First, if you feel doubtful about entering certain situations or doubt that you can perform certain activities because of YOut fear or anxiety, that is a sign for you to go ahead and face those situations or activities. Use your breathing skills. 195 long-Term Goals long-Term Goal Steps to Achieve long-Term Goal -~~_ -_ ~-_._-~ Use your thinking strategies to help you cope with whatever it is that you are anxious about. Remember, avoidance is one of the biggest causes of growing anxiety. Second, record your mood. That is, at least once a month, consider how you have been doing in terms of your general level of anxiety and, if appropriate, your number of panic attacks. It is easier to take corrective action at an early stage rather than waiting until you are in the midst of intense panic and anxiety. Record your mood at least once a month by simply asking yourself how anxious you have felt over the last week, or how much have you been worrying about things, or whether you have had any panic attacks. It helps to tie this recording to a regular event that will remind you. Examples include monthly payment of bills or monthly meetings. Each month, record your mood just before or after such events. 196 Your High-Risk Times Setbacks Third, every now and then, review the educational information in chapters 3 and 4. Newly learned material needs to be reviewed for it to become a solid part of your way of thinking. The most high-risk times for panic or anxiety to increase are stressful periods in your life. These periods can be any times in which you are under a lot of stress; whether that means job loss, the breakup of a relationship, the birth of a child, or a serious illness. Stress affects our nervous systems in ways that make us generally more tense and, therefore, causes us to have more physical symptoms and to be more likely to think negatively. For these reasons, it is helpful to anticipate the kinds of stressful events ahead of time and to prepare for them in a matter-of-fact way. First, think of ways in which to manage your own anxiety. Be aware of your habits of jumping to conclusions, or blowing things out of proportion, or avoiding things. Second, think of concrete steps for managing the stress, such as how to deal with an angry boss or an overdue bilL A panic attack or resurgence of anxiety does not mean that you are getting worse or that you have lost all of the progress that you have gained. Consider it like being on a road trip and having one of the tires on your car go flat. Yes, you need to fix the tire, but that does not mean you must go back to the beginning of your road trip. Fix the damage and continue on with your journey. With panic and anxiety, fixing the damage means to think abom what triggered the panic or anxiety, where you were jumping to conclusions or blowing things out of proportion, and how can you think more calmly and realistically. Then, continue to move forward by facing the things that made you anxious. 197 The most important thing to do when you have a flare-up of anxious symptoms is to repeat everything you have already done: breathing skills, thinking skills, facing agoraphobia situations, and facing symptoms. Just because panic and anxiety have reoccurred does not mean that the treatment will not work again. It is like the old saying: if you fall off the horse, you need to dust yourself off and get back up. For complete accounts of recent research on the nature and causes of panic and anxiety, you may wish to read David H. Barlow, Anxiety and its disorders: The nature and treatment ofanxiety andpanic, second edition (2002), and Michelle G. Craske, Anxiety disorders: Psychological approaches to theory and treatment (1999).   To understand the characteristics of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). To learn about Prolonged Exposure Therapy (PE). To learn how this program was developed. To understand what the program will involve What Is Posttraumatic Stress Disorder? Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder that may develop after an event that is experienced or witnessed and involves actual or perceived threat to life or physical integrity. The person\\'s emotional reaction to this event is characterized by horror, terror, or helplessness. As shown in Table ?.?, people with PTSD have three major types of symptoms, which typically relate to:. Reexperience of the trauma. Avoidance of trauma reminders. Hyperarousal The symptoms of PTSD are common right after traumatic events, but for most trauma survivors, these symptoms decrease over time through natural recovery. However, for some people, the PTSD symptoms stay on, become chronic, and interfere with daily functioning. If this is true in your case, this program, based on Prolonged Exposure (PE) Therapy, can help. 1 Chapter 1 Introduction What Is Prolonged Exposure (PE) Therapy? PE is a way to help trauma survivors to emotionally process their traumatic experiences. Doing this reduces PTSD and other trauma-related problems. The name Prolonged Exposure (PE) comes from the long tradition of exposure therapy for anxiety disorders. In exposure therapy clients are helped to confront safe but anxiety-arousing situations in order to decrease their excessive fear and anxiety. We are all familiar with the principles of exposure therapy. For example, a classic example of exposure is the advice to a rider toget back on the horse after being thrown off. In doing so, the rider overcomes her fear of being thrown again and prevents the fear from growing to excessive proportions. At the same time, PE is rooted in the Emotional Processing Theory of PTSD. This theory emphasizes that special processing of the traumatic 2 Table 1.1 Symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms of Reexperiencing Symptoms of Avoidance Symptoms of Increased Arousal Recurrent and intrusive distressing Efforts to avoid thoughts, feelings, or Difficulty falling or staying recollections of the event, including conversations associated with the asleep images, thoughts, or perceptions trauma Recurrent distressing dreams of the Efforts to avoid activities, places, or Irritability or outbursts of event people that arouse recollections of the anger trauma Acting or feeling as if the traumatic Inability to recall an important aspect Difficulty concentrating event were recurring (includes a sense of the trauma of reliving the experience, illusions, hallucinations, and dissociative flashback episodes, including those that occur on awakening or when intoxicated) Intense psychological distress at expo- Markedly diminished interest or parti- Hypervigilance sure to internal or external cues that cipation in significant activities symbolize or resemble an aspect of the traumatic event Physiological reactivity on exposure to Feeling of detachment or estrange- Exaggerated startle response internal or external cues that symbolize ment from others or resemble an aspect of the traumatic Restricted range of affect (e.g., unable event to have loving feelings) Sense of foreshortened future (e.g., does not expect to have a career, marriage, children, or a normal life span) event must take place to help reduce PTSD symptoms. Throughout this workbook, we will emphasize emotional processing because it successfully reduces PTSD symptoms. We discuss Emotional Processing Theory in more detail in the section that follows. The Prolonged Exposure treatment program includes the following procedures:. Education about common reactions to trauma. You and your therapist will discuss common reactions that many people have, as well as your specific reactions.. Breathing retraining, i.e., teaching you how to breathe in a calming way.. Repeated in vivo (in real life) exposure to situations or activities that you are avoiding because they remind you of your traumatic experience and make you anxious or distressed.. Repeated, prolonged imaginal exposure to the trauma memories (i.e., revisiting the trauma in your imagination). In vivo and imaginal exposures are the core of the treatment. These techniques were selected because there is a great deal of evidence showing that they effectively reduce anxiety and distress in people who suffer from anxiety disorders, such as specific phobias, panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, and obsessive compulsive disorder. As we discuss later in the chapter,  years of research have shown that PE is effective in reducing PTSD and other trauma-related problems such as depression, general anxiety, and anger. Obviously, there are no guarantees about how you will respond, but many, many people have been helped by this program, so we are hopeful that you will be too. The aim of in vivo and imaginal exposure is to help you emotionally process the traumatic events by helping you face the memories of your trauma and the situations that are associated with these memories. This is a powerful way for you to learn that the memories of the trauma, and the situations or activities that are associated with these memories, are not the same as the trauma itself. You will learn that you can safely remember your trauma and experience the trauma reminders. The anxiety and distress that you feel at first will go down over time and you will be able to tolerate this anxiety. Ultimately, this treatment will help you reclaim your life from PTSD. 3 What Is Emotional Processing Theory? Prolonged Exposure Therapy is based on Emotional Processing Theory and was developed by Foa and Kozak (, ) as a way to understand anxiety disorders and how exposure therapy reduces anxiety symptoms. Emotional Processing Theory is based on the idea that fear is represented in memory as aprogram for escaping danger. The fear structure includes different kinds of information, including information about what it is we are afraid of, called the feared stimuli (e.g., a bear), the fear responses (e.g., heart rate increases), and the meaning associated with the stimuli (e.g., bears are dangerous) and responses (e.g., fast heartbeat means I am afraid). When a fear is realistic we call it normal fear, and the fear structure contains information about how we can best respond to the real threat. So feeling fear or terror if we see a bear and acting to escape are appropriate responses and can be seen as a normal and helpful fear reaction. According to Foa and Kozak (), a fear structure becomes a problem when (?) the information in the structure does not accurately represent the world, (?) physical and escape/avoidance responses are triggered by harmless stimuli, (?) the fear responses interfere with daily functioning, and (?) harmless stimuli and responses are viewed as being dangerous. Foa and Kozak proposed that two conditions are necessary for successfully changing the unrealistic and abnormal fear structure, thereby reducing anxiety symptoms. First, the person\\'s fear and anxiety need to be triggered or activated. If this is not done, the fear structure cannot be changed. Second, realistic information (e.g., talking about the traumatic experience and remembering that it did not cause me to break down) needs to replace the original, unrealistic information in the fear structure (e.g., I will fall apart if I allow myself to talk or think about the trauma). Exposure therapy meets these two conditions. Sometimes, people also have thoughts that if they confront what they are scared of their anxiety will be so high that they willlose control orgo crazy. But research has shown that when they confront what they are scared of in a therapeutic manner, it helps these thoughts go away as well. Dr. Foa and her colleagues have published a number of papers describing how this treatment helps people with PTSD (Foa, Steketee, & Rothbaum, ; Foa & Riggs, ; Foa & Jaycox, ; Foa & Cahill, ; Foa, Huppert, & Cahill, ). 4 You may wonder why some trauma survivors develop PTSD and some do not. Within the framework of Emotional Processing Theory, the development of chronic PTSD is caused by the failure to fully process the traumatic memory. So the goal of therapy for PTSD is to promote emotional processing. Exposure to feared stimuli results in the activation (bringing to mind) of the relevant fear structure and at the same time provides realistic information about the likelihood and cost of the consequences you fear. In addition to the fear of external threat (e.g., being attacked again), the person may have unhelpful or inaccurate beliefs about anxiety itself that are disconfirmed during exposure, such as the belief that anxiety will never end until the situation is escaped or that the anxiety will cause the person tolose control orgo crazy. This new information is learned during the exposure therapy session, which changes the fear structure and causes the person to be less afraid the next time he or she faces that situation, and thereby results in a reduction of PTSD symptoms. Prolonged Exposure for the treatment of PTSD works through bringing to mind the fear structure, deliberately confronting trauma-related thoughts and images, imaginal and in vivo exposure, and learning that what you were afraid of is very unlikely to happen. By confronting trauma memories and reminders, people learn that they can tolerate these situations and that nothing bad happens to them. They also learn that their anxiety will decrease even while they are confronting what they fear. People learn that they don\\'t go crazy or lose control. Imaginal and in vivo exposure exercises help you tell the difference between the traumatic event and other similar but non-dangerous events. This allows you to see the trauma as a specific event occurring in space and time, which helps you get over your feelings and thoughts that the world is entirely dangerous and that you are completely incompetent to deal with it. Importantly, people with PTSD often report that thinking about the traumatic event makes it feel as if it is happening all over again. Repeated imaginal exposure to the trauma memory helps people tell the difference between the past and present. It helps them realize that although remembering the trauma can be emotionally upsetting, the trauma is not happening again and therefore thinking about the event is not dangerous. Repeated imaginal exposure also helps people think differently about what happened to them. For example, someone who feels guilty about not having done more to resist an attacker may soon realize that the assault might have been more severe if she had resisted. All of these changes reduce PTSD symptoms and 5 bring about a sense of mastery and competence. In each session following the imaginal exposure, you will talk with your therapist about the experience and how you are thinking and feeling about it and how that changes over time. Thisprocessing also helps change your fear structure. How Was the Program Developed? The PE treatment program was developed by the authors at the Center for the Treatment and Study of Anxiety (CTSA) at the University of Pennsylvania. Over the last  years we have conducted well-controlled studies in which we provided this treatment to hundreds of clients. In addition, we have trained many therapists in various settings and countries to use this treatment. Our clinical experiences and the results of our studies have guided the evolution of PE to its current form, which is detailed in the chapters that follow. PE has worked well in studies that were conducted at universities and when delivered by therapists in community agencies in the United States and around the world, including Israel, Japan, Australia, and Europe. Dr. Foa has been training therapists worldwide to use this therapy and is continuing to train more therapists. As a result of the large body of research supporting the effectiveness of PE, the treatment program was given a  Exemplary Substance Abuse Prevention Program Award by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), and was designated as a Model Program for national dissemination. We are very excited about how much PE helps people, and that is part of why we wrote this bookto help more people use it. Risks and Benefits of This Treatment Program Benefits Twenty years of research on PE have yielded findings that clearly support the effectiveness of PE as a treatment for PTSD. Nearly all studies have found that PE reduces not only PTSD but also other trauma-related problems, including depression and general anxiety. It helps people to reclaim their lives. 6 Risks The primary risks associated with PE therapy are discomfort and emotional distress, especially when confronting anxiety-provoking images, memories, and situations in the course of treatment. PE is designed to get you in touch with these emotions and reactions, and we know that it is often painful, especially at first. That is why it is best to do PE with the help of a trained therapist who will be there to help you through it. You may feel worse before you feel better. But, if you stick with it, the chances are excellent that you will feel much better in the long run. It is worth it! Alternative Treatments In addition to PE and other versions of exposure therapy, the CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) programs that have been found effective include stress inoculation training (SIT), cognitive processing therapy (CPT), cognitive therapy (CT ), and eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR). For detailed reviews, see Foa & Meadows, ; Rothbaum et al., ; Harvey, Bryant, & Tarrier, , and Cahill & Foa, .? The Role of Medications Zoloft and Paxil are the only medications approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in treating PTSD. It is common for people already taking either of these drugs or other appropriate medication for PTSD and/or depression to enter therapy. If you are already taking these medications but still suffer from PTSD, you can stay on the medication and go through the PE program because we have not found the medication to interfere with this treatment. Outline of This Treatment Program The treatment program consists of weekly or twice-weekly treatment sessions that are generally  minutes each. This workbook is divided into chapters that talk about what will happen in each session. 7 Each chapter includes the techniques you will use and how to use them, home exercises, and all necessary handouts and forms. Each session should be audiotaped for you to review as part of homework each session. In addition, a separate audiotape will be made during the breathing retraining in session ? for you to use at home to practice the breathing relaxation. Finally, beginning in session ?, separate tapes of your imaginal exposure will be made for you to listen to once a day at home. Thus, two tapes are used in any session including imaginal exposure: thesession tape records everything up to the beginning of your imaginal exposure, at which point the therapist will switch to a new audiotape to record only the imaginal exposure, and then will return to the session audiotape to record the discussion that follows the exposure exercise. Structure of Sessions Session ? begins by presenting you with an overview of the treatment program and a general rationale for prolonged exposure. The second part of the session is devoted to collecting information about the trauma, your reactions to the trauma, and other stressful experiences you may have had. The session ends with the introduction of breathing retraining. For homework, you will be asked to review the Rationale for Treatment and practice the breathing retraining on a daily basis. Session ? presents you with an opportunity to talk in detail about your reactions to the trauma and its effect on you. Common reactions to trauma are discussed in this workbook. Next, your therapist will present the rationale for exposure, with an emphasis on in vivo exposure. Finally, during session ?, you and your therapist will construct a hierarchy of situations or activities and places that you are avoiding. After this session you will begin confronting situations for homework using in vivo exposure methods. Session ? ends with your therapist assigning specific in vivo exposures for homework. You will also be encouraged to continue using the breathing exercises you learned in session ? throughout the day when you feel anxious and to read the Common Reactions to Trauma information daily. Session ? begins with homework review. Your therapist will explain the rationale for imaginal exposure, or revisiting and recounting the trauma memory using your imagination. With your therapist\\'s support and guidance, you will then experience your first imaginal revisiting of the trauma 8 memory. During this exposure, you will be asked to visualize and describe the trauma memory for minutes. This is followed by minutes of discussion aimed at helping you to continue processing your thoughts and feelings about the trauma. Your homework for this session is to listen to the audiotape of the imaginal exposure and to continue with your in vivo exposure exercises. Sessions ?? (or more) consist of homework review, followed by imaginal exposure, postexposure processing of thoughts and feelings, and discussion of your in vivo homework assignments. As treatment advances, you are encouraged to describe the trauma in much more detail during the imaginal exposure and to gradually focus more and more on the most distressing aspects of the trauma experience, or memoryhot spots. In later sessions, as you improve, the time dedicated to imaginal exposure will decrease to about  minutes. Session  (or the Final Session) includes homework review, imaginal exposure, discussion of this exposure (with emphasis on how the experience has changed over the course of therapy), and a detailed review of your progress in treatment. The final part of the session is devoted to discussing continued practice of all that you learned in treatment, relapse prevention, and, if you are terminating therapy, saying goodbye to your therapist. You have chosen to take back your life, and you are on the way! 9  Is This Program Right for You? Goals To determine if this program is right for you To enhance your motivation for treatment Who Is Prolonged Exposure Therapy For? Not every trauma survivor needs a trauma~focused treatment like PE. Many studies have shown that natural recovery works very well for many people who experience a traumatic event. In fact, PTSD symptoms and other trauma reactions are very common and happen for almost everyone right after a trauma, but then they decrease a lot for many people, especially over the first 3 months. If at least a month has passed since you have experienced the traumatic event and you are still suffering from PTSD symptoms that are interfering with your life, it is time to think about seeking PE treatment. On the basis of treating and studying hundreds of trauma survivors, we recommend that you consider treatment with PE if: II You have PTSD and related problems (e.g., depression, chronic anxiety. high levels ofanger or shame) following a trauma. You have a clear enough memory ofthe traumatic event{s} that you have a story ofit: you can imagine it and describe the traumatic memory (verbally or in writing), and the story has a beginning, middle, and end. We do not recommend treatment with PE if: You have strong urges and a plan to commit suicide or to harm other people or ifyou have recently attempted such behaviors. While feeling suicidal and having a history of suicide gestures or attempts are quite common in people with PTSD, if suicidal plans or intentions are 11 III current, we recommend that you address them in treatment first. Studies have shown that PE reduces symptoms of depression as well as PTSD, but you have to be feeling strong enough and committed to staying alive in order to achieve these benefits. If you have doubts or concerns about this, you should definitely discuss them with your therapist so that you can together make decisions about treatment focus and how and when to proceed with PE. You are engaging in serious self-injurious behavior. It is also not unusual for some people with PTSD to have histories of cutting or burning or otherwise hurting themselves on purpose. However, if this is currently going on, you should not start PE until you are able to manage the impulses to hurt yourself without acting on them. If this has been a way that you have coped with emotional pain in the past, then during treatment you may have increased urges to harm yourself. But doing so is not an option during treatment with PE, as you need to learn that you can tolerate these negative emotions and that they will decrease without efforts to escape, avoid, or distract. You have a current, high risk ofbeing assaulted or abused (e.g., you are living with an abusive spouse, partner; or some otherperson who is physically hurtingyou). If you are currently in a living situation in which you are being beaten, sexually assaulted, or seriously harmed, this must be the first focus of any help you receive. Your safety is absolutely most important. PE or any treatment for past traumas should be delayed until you are safely away from this ongoing violence. You do not have sufficient memory ofthe traumatic event(s). PE should not be used as a means of helping someone retrieve or remember a traumatic event. While people do sometimes remember more details of a trauma through the course of PE, we strongly discourage its use with people who have only a \"sense\" or a vague feeling that they suffered a trauma that is not remembered. If this describes what you feel, then we recommend that you discuss it with your therapist. The therapist can help you deal with these feelings but should not try to use imaginal exposure to pull for or help you to recover memories. Other issues to consider when deciding if you are a good candidate for PE: 12 Presence of Drug andlor Alcohol Abuse and Dependence In our early studies, we usually recommended that people with drug or alcohol problems seek treatment for the drug- and alcohol-related disorders first and then return for trauma-focused therapy. We have modified this practice over recent years and now offer PE to PTSD sufferers with current drug and alcohol abuse. We even have some preliminary evidence from an ongoing study that people with chronic PTSD and alcohol dependence benefit from PE, while getting treatment for their alcohol dependence at the same time. But we do often see alcohol and substance use as a form of avoidance and strongly encourage people to stop the alcohol or substance use, with the aid of AA or NA and other available supports. We monitor the substance abuse throughout treatment and are especially watchful for its use as a way to decrease or avoid anxiety and other painful feelings. You probably know whether you are using alcohol or drugs to block out distressing, trauma-related feelings and thoughts. You probably also know that such abuse may eventually bring about a whole host of other problems in life. If you,are going to use PE to deal with your trauma-related problems, it is important that you think about whether you use alcohol and/or drugs to avoid or block out painful thoughts and feelings and that you discuss this with your therapist. It may be helpful to seek additional help or support to reduce or stop your use of substances. living or Working in a High-Risk Environment It is reasonable to question whether PE will be effective for someone who lives in a very dangerous area or has a hazardous job that carries a significant risk of harm. Unfortunately, examples of this are plentiful: the person living with the threat of terrorist attacks in Israel or war-torn countries, the woman living in an impoverished and violent neighborhood next door to a crack house, and the active-duty marine who will soon be deployed overseas for another tour of duty in a dangerous land. Can PE help people whose life circumstances make it likely that they may be exposed to more traumas in the future or even during their treatment? Our experiences both in the United States and abroad have taught us that the answer to this question is often yes. If you have PTSD, then a big part of the fear and avoidance you are experiencing is due to events that happened to you in the past. While this fear may be fueled by the present-day 13 risk of harm, the reverse is also usually true: the presence of PTSD is likely amplifYing or worsening your fear of harm in day-to-day life. This disorder makes people very afraid in their present lives. You and your therapist will do your best to plan your in vivo exposure exercises so that they will be useful to your recovery but not carry a high risk of harm or danger. We think that when the PTSD symptoms related to your past trauma are reduced, you will be better able to address how you can live your life more comfortably given the day-to-day stresses and dangers you may face. In summary, most individuals with PTSD (or severe, clinically significant symptoms of PTSD) foJlowing all types of trauma and who have a clear memory of their traumatic experience(s) are potentially good candidates for PE. Other problems, as well as multiple life difficulties (e.g., unemployment, financial difficulties, chronic health problems, relationship and family troubles, social isolation, to name a few), are extremely common in people with chronic PTSD. You may be suffering from some of these problems yourself In general, we recommend that if a disorder other than PTSD is present that is life threatening or otherwise causing problems, it should be treated before you try PE. Enhancing Motivation for Treatment It is difficult for people suffering from PTSD to confront feared and avoided memories and reminders of traumatic experiences. The dropout rate from exposure therapy is no different than that of other active forms ofCBT for PTSD, but nonetheless, 20-30% of PTSD clients do terminate treatment prematurely. Avoidance is part of PTSD, and people orren struggle with urges to avoid throughout treatment. You may experience this, too, and your therapist will understand and even expect this. He or she will most likely discuss it with you and help you over the avoidance hurdles as they come up. If you find that you are struggling with whether it is worth it to deal with your trauma and try to recover from PTSD and are not sure if you want to go through this program now, we think it is helpful for you to consider a few important questions: (1) What areas of your life have been disrupted or are unsatisfYing as a result ofthe trauma? (2) What are some potential gains or positive changes that will result from therapy or from reducing PTSD 14 symptoms and related interference? (3) What are some likely obstacles to successful therapy (e.g., difficulties attending therapy sessions, finding time to do homework, finding a tape player to listen to audiotapes or the privacy to listen to them, etc.)? and (4) What do you need to help find the motivation for therapy or to give yourself permission to do this now? If the trauma was recent enough that you can remember life before and after the trauma, think about how the PTSD is controlling your life now. What things that you used to enjoy can you not do anymore or not do without a lot of anxiety? Other useful areas to think about: Are there things that your friends or other people are able to do that you do not do now? What would you like to change in your life now? What do you wish you could do at the end of therapy or 6 months from now? Have you tried to get help for this in the past? What was it like? Did it help you? If not, why not? What made it difficult for you? If you did not complete treatment, what made you decide to quit? Some people going through PE feel worse before they feel better, and their symptoms may increase before heading down. Given what you know about yourself, if this happens, how will it be for you? Is there anything your therapist can do to help you tolerate this temporary worsening? PE requires time and effort. The homework is an important part of the process. Is there anything that may get in the way of your being able to do this? Sometimes there are aspects of people\\'s lives that actually change for the better after a trauma. Is this true for you, and if so, what do you feel you have gained from experiencing the trauma? Although PE is often really effective in helping people get their lives back, it also can be stressful and may sometimes be time intensive and demanding. Will the effort of therapy be worthwhile for you? What will happen in your life if you don\\'t work on these problems? Finally, some clients have worried about how their therapist will handle the impact of hearing such detailed descriptions of traumatic events. They 15 worry about the therapist and his or her reactions to what they describe. While the concern is appreciated, it is not good for treatment. Please rest assured that your therapist is able to handle whatever you have to say. He or she is there to take care of you. Although PE will be challenging at times for you and your therapist, it is very rewarding for both as well. We have had clients come back after therapy and tell us that they feel like the people they were before the trauma and that they had not thought that was possible. PE has allowed us to witness the resilience of the human spirit. We wish you the same! 16 Goals II To learn about the treatment program and the procedures that will be used To complete the Trauma Interview with your therapist To learn a brief breathing retraining relaxation technique Overview of Program and Treatment Procedures Used The main tools of this therapy program are imaginal and in vivo exposure. You and your therapist will discuss why this therapy is important for you and how it will be tailored to you and your specific trauma-related symptoms and concerns. You will have the chance to ask questions and make sure you understand why you are being asked to relive the painful memories of your traumatic experience and how you can do it effectively to help make them less painful. Some people who have been through traumatic experiences tell us that they have tried and failed to face their fears or that they did face them but their anxiety did not decrease. Some just cannot picture themselves doing some things they have been avoiding or being strong enough to picture and describe traumatic memories. Have you had thoughts like this? If so, share them with your therapist; she won\\'t be surprised to hear them. In this session, you and your therapist will discuss how this therapy makes sense for you and the problems you are experiencing and how it will be different from how you have approached your memories in the past. This treatment program consists usually of IO to 12 90-minute sessions but occasionally can take up to 15 sessions in total. You will meet once or twice per week with your therapist, so the therapy will be completed in about 2 or 3 months. In this program, you are going to focus on the fears that you are experiencing and on your problems coping, both of which are directly 17 related to your traumatic experience(s). Although otten posttrauma reactions gradually get better with time, for many survivors like you, some of these symptoms continue to cause distress. It is helpful for your recovery process to understand what maintains posttrauma problems. A major factor that maintains your trauma-related difficulties is avoidance of situations, memories, thoughts, and feelings that are related to your traumatic experiences. There are two ways that people avoid dealing with trauma reminders. The first is trying to push away images and feelings about the trauma. The second is escaping or avoiding situations, places, people, and activities that cause distress and fear because they are similar to the trauma or are reminders of the trauma. However, while the strategy of avoiding trauma-related thoughts and situations works in the short run, it actually prolongs the posttrauma reactions and prevents you from getting over your trauma-related difficulties. Can you think of things that you have avoided since the trauma? It is helpful to write them down and talk about them with your therapist. Because avoiding thoughts about the trauma and situations that remind you of the trauma maintains your PTSD, Prolonged Exposure Therapy encourages you to face your trauma-related thoughts and situations as a way of helping you to deal with them. The treatment includes two types of confrontations or exposures. The first one is called imaginal exposure, in which we will ask you to revisit the traumatic experience and recount it aloud. The goal of imaginal exposure is to help you to process the traumatic memory by asking you to repeatedly face the memory during your sessions. We have found that repeated and prolonged (up to 45 minutes) imaginal exposure to the traumatic memory is quite effective in reducing trauma-related symptoms and helps you to think about it differently. The second type of exposure is called in vivo exposure, which just means exposure \"in real life.\" Here we will ask you to gradually approach situations that you have been avoiding because they remind you of the trauma, directly or indirectly (e.g., driving a car, walking alone in safe place, or lighting a fire in the fireplace). In vivo exposure is very effective in reducing excessive fears and avoidance after a trauma. If you avoid trauma-related situations that are objectively safe, you do not give yourself the chance to get over your fear of these situations. This is because until you face these situations, you may continue to believe that they are dangerous and that your anxiety in these situations will remain forever. However, if you face these situations 18 in a gradual, systematic way, you will find out that they are not actually dangerous and that your anxiety will go down with repeated, prolonged confrontations. Does the idea of exposure make sense to you? A second factor that maintains your posttrauma reactions is the presence of unhelpful disturbingperceptions, thoughts, and beliefi. These disturbing perceptions and beliefs may be about the world in general, other people, yourself, or your reaction to the trauma. As a result of trauma, many people adopt the idea that the world is extremely dangerous. Therefore, even objectively safe situations are viewed as dangerous. Also, immediately after the trauma, many people adopt the view that they are incompetent and unable to cope, even with normal daily stressors. Trauma survivors may also blame themselves for the trauma and put themselves down because they are having difficulty coping after it. Engaging in or resuming daily activities and not avoiding trauma reminders help trauma survivors realize that the world is mostly safe and they are mostly competent. However, avoiding trauma reminders and developing PTSD often makes survivors continue to view the world as extremely dangerous and themselves as extremely incompetent and unable to cope. Does this sound familiar? Do you feel this way about yourself? How do these excessively negative and unrealistic thoughts and beliefs about the world and about yourself maintain your posttrauma reactions? If you believe that the world is dangerous, you will continue to avoid even safe situations. Similarly, if you believe that the trauma is your fault, you may blame yourself and feel incompetent, and this will interfere with your ability to get back to your usual life. Likewise, if you believe that experiencing flashbacks is a sign that you are losing control, you may try very hard to push the traumatic memories out of your mind. However, the more you try to push these memories away, the more they will intrude on your consciousness and the less control you will actually have over the memories. These disturbing thoughts and beliefs may be triggered during the repeated imaginal and in vivo exposure. But the revisiting and recounting of the traumatic event will give you the opportunity to gain a new, more realistic perspective about what happened and what it means to you now. We are going to try to make sense of a terrible situation, to give you a useful way to think about it. You are going to work very hard, together with your therapist, during the next few weeks to help you get on with your life. Your work will be inten- 19 sive, and you may find that you are experiencing discomfort as you face the things that remind you of your trauma. Your therapist may be available to talk with you between sessions if you feel that it would be helpful to you. Information Gathering At this point in the session, your therapist will ask you questions from the Trauma Interview to collect general information about your current problems and functioning, the traumatic experience(s), your physical and mental health since the trauma, social support, and use of alcohol and drugs. We understand that answering specific and directive questions about the traumatic experience(s) and your reactions to the trauma may be difficult for you. However, this is an important step for you in your treatment, and your therapist needs to know what happened to you and how you have reacted to be able to help you. Be assured that therapists who are trained in this type of therapy and in helping people who have been through these types of experiences can handle it. He or she can also handle your reactions, so you are in good hands. Breathing Retraining After the interview, your therapist will teach you a brief breathing retraining relaxation technique before you leave the first session in order to help with any anxiety that may have been triggered by discussing the trauma. Most of us realize that our breathing affects the way that we feeL For example, when we are upset, people may tell us to take a deep breath and calm down. However, taking one deep breath often does not help. Instead, in order to calm down you should slow down your breathing by taking normal breaths and exhaling slowly. It is exhalation that is associated with relaxation, not inhalation. While you exhale, say the words calm or relax silendy to yourself very slowly. Like this: c-a-a-a-a-a-a-l-m. In addition to concentrating on slow exhalation while saying calm to yourself, we want you to try to slow down your rate of breathing. Very often, when people become frightened or upset, they feel like they need more air and may therefore hyperventilate. Hyperventilation, however, does not have 20 a calming effect. In fact, it makes you feel more anxious. Unless we are preparing to fight or flee from real danger, we often do not need as much air as we are taking in when we are anxious. When we are anxious, we may hyperventilate, or over-breathe; this signals our bodies that we are getting ready to fight or flee and that we need extra oxygen in order to do so. This is similar to a runner taking deep breaths to fuel the body with oxygen before a race and continuing to breathe deeply and quickly throughout the race. Hyperventilating also produces bodily reactions that resemble fear. These bodily reactions, in turn, can make us more afraid. What we really need to do is to slow down our breathing and take in less air. You will take a normal breath and exhale very slowly, saying the word calm or relax to yourself Then you will pause and count to three or four before taking a second breath. Repeat the entire breathing sequence 10 to 15 times. Your therapist may make a tape of himself or herself directing you through these breathing exercises for you to practice with for homework. Please review the breathing retraining technique in the next section. You should practice this breathing technique three times a day, but you can also use it when you feel particularly tense or distressed throughout the day or to help you relax or go to sleep at night. Breathing Retraining Technique Purpose of Exercises Slow down breathing iii Decrease amount of oxygen in blood iii With practice, decrease anxiety Breathing Instructions I. Take a normal breath in through your nose with your mouth dosed. 2. Exhale slowly with your mouth dosed. 3. On exhaling, silently say to yourself the word calm or relax very slowly; for example: c-a-a-a-a-a-l-m or r-e-e-e-l-a-a-a-a-a-x. 21 4. 5. Pause, holding your breath, for a count of four, and then take the next inhalation. Practice this exercise several times a day, for 10 minutes each time. Listening to Session Tapes Your therapist will audiotape all of your sessions and give you the session tape to listen to as part of your homework between sessions. Many clients have found this a useful experience. It gives you an opportunity to think about and process information you received and the discussion you had with your therapist. This is often very helpful, as we process information differently when we are not actively engaged in a conversation. In several weeks, when you begin revisiting and recounting your trauma memory in session, your therapist will also make you a separate tape of this imaginal exposure to listen to at home. Homework ~ Practice breathing retraining for 10 minutes, three times a day. ~ Listen to the audiotape of this session one time. ~ Read the Rationale for Treatment found at the end of this chapter. You may share it with people who are dose to you if you think it will help them understand what you are going through. Rationale for Treatment by Prolonged Exposure The treatment program you are participating in is called Prolonged Exposure. There are two main parts to this program. The first is imaginal exposure, in which you relive the trauma repeatedly in your mind. The second part is in vivo exposure, in which you confront safe situations that you have been avoiding because you became afraid of them after your trauma. Many people who have experienced a trauma try to avoid thoughts and feelings associated with that event. Similarly, many people also avoid situations, places, and activities that remind them of the - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - _ - - - - - - - - - - - - - 22 trauma or that just feel scary. However, while avoiding can make you feel more comfortable in the short run, it actually can make the problem worse in the long run, because it prevents you from overcoming your fears. Imaginal and in vivo exposure address these problems and work in similar ways. How does exposure work? When you confront feared memories or situations in a systematic way under relatively safe circumstances, several things happen. One, reliving the memory helps to emotionally process the traumatic experience and make sense of it. Two, you learn that thinking about a traumatic experience is not dangerous and that being upset or anxious is not dangerous. Three, you become less fearful of other situations that remind you of your trauma. Four, you learn that you can handle your fear and anxiety, and you feel better about yourself. Finally, you learn that when you repeatedly confront memories or situations you have avoided, the fear and distress gradually decrease. In other words, you again become relatively comfortable in these situations. We call this habituation.. Habituation is the process by which anxiety comes down on its own. When you stick it our and stay in a frightening but safe situation for a long enough time and you go back to that same situation often enough, you simply become less frightened of this situation. In a way, it is similar to \"getting back on a bicycle\" after falling off. If you refuse to try again, over time you become more and more frightened of riding bicycles. But if you force yourself to ride them despite your fear, you become less afraid. Habituation works with frightening memories, too. Letting yourself engage in the traumatic memories rather than avoiding them will allow you to remember the trauma with less distress, and you will learn that the memories are not dangerous. Exposure to the painful memories, i.e., reliving the trauma in imagination, also allows you to gain control over them so they will be less likely to pop up at times you do not want them to. The flashbacks, nightmares, and intrusive thoughts that many trauma survivors often experience are less likely to occur after you repeatedly relive the trauma, and when they do occur, they are less upsetting. Following a trauma, people\\'s beliefs about themselves and about the world may change in basic ways. You may view situations as dangerous when before the trauma they would not have bothered you at all. You may find that your attitude toward people and in general has become more negative than it used to be, or that your self-image has gotten worse. Many times these changes reflect trauma-related changes in your thinking. Sometimes even 23 the presence of posttraumatic stress disorder may cause you to think and feel negatively about yourself Because how you think about yourself, the world, and other people affects how you feel, it is useful to pay attention to how the traumatic experience has shaped your thoughts and beliefs. For this reason, as you go through the treatment, you and your therapist will discuss how you think about the trauma, yourself, other people, and situations in your life. You will sometimes explore trauma-related changes in your thinking in order to see how they affect your feelings and whether they are helpful or not. Treatment by imaginal and in vivo exposure may seem difficult at first, and many trauma survivors are afraid of becoming involved in it. But with time you will find that this treatment is challenging and makes you feel good about yourself Congratulations! You have made the very scary first step in taking back control of your life! 24 Session 2 Goals III To review homework III To learn about the common reactions to trauma To review the rationale for exposure therapy, especially for in vivo exposure II To learn about the Subjective Units of Discomfort Scale (SUDS) III To create your in vivo exposure hierarchy To choose in vivo assignments for homework Overview In session 2, you and your therapist will discuss the usual/common reactions that people have after they experience a traumatic event, as well as your personal experience of these reactions. Your therapist will explain to . you why in vivo exposure works, and you will work together to construct a list of safe or low-risk situations that you have been avoiding and that are important for you to confront again. After this session, you will begin your in vivo exposure practice. You will confront situations in real life (\"in vivo\") that you avoid or that, if you can\\'t entirely avoid them, you try to bear as briefly as possible. Most of your in vivo exposure practices will be done betw~ en sessions as homework exercises. However, sometimes your in vivo exposure might include situations or things that can be practiced during your therapy session, such as greeting men or making eye contact with them, lying on your back with your eyes closed, sitting in a waiting room with unfamiliar people, sitting at a table in a cafeteria by yourself or with your back to others, etc. If it seems useful, these situations may be first practiced in the therapy session with your therapist. 25 Homework Review At the beginning of the session, you and your therapist will discuss how you have been doing in the past week and about your reactions to the first session. Your therapist will review the questionnaires you filled out before the session to see how your mood and symptoms have been during the last week. Discussion about the Common Reactions to Trauma The common reactions to trauma discussion has several aims: To help you share your own experience of PTSD symptoms and related problems and give you information about these reactions. To help you to understand your symptoms and reactions by putting them into context. To give you hope by helping you realize that many of your problems are directly related to PTSD and that many of them will improve with this treatment. You will spend a large part of this session talking with your therapist about the common reactions to trauma. Please review the Common Reactions to Trauma information included here after the session as part of your homework. Common Reactions to Trauma A traumatic experience is an emotional shock and may cause many emotional problems. This section describes some ofthe common reactions people have after a trauma. Because everyone responds differently to traumatic events. you may have some of these reactions more than others. and some you may not have at all. Remember, many changes after a trauma are normal. In fact. most people who directly experience a major trauma have severe reactions in the immediate aftermath. Many people then feel much better within 3 months after the event. but others recover more slowly, and some do not recover enough without help. Becoming more aware of the changes you have undergone since your trauma is the first step toward recovery. . 26 Some of the most common problems after a trauma are described below. 1. Fear and anxiety. Anxiety is a common and natural response to a dangerous situation. For many people it lasts long after the trauma has ended. This happens when one\\'s views of the world and sense of safety have changed and become more negative. You may become anxious when you remember the trauma. But sometimes anxiety may come from out of the blue. Triggers or cues that can cause anxiety may include places, times of day, certain smells or noises, or any situation that reminds you of the trauma. As you begin to pay more attention to the times you feel afraid, you can discover the triggers for your anxiety. In this way, you may learn that some of the out-of-theblue anxiety is really triggered by things that remind you of your trauma. 2. Reexperiencing the trauma. People who have been traumatized often reexperience the traumatic event. For example, you may have unwanted thonghts of the trauma and find yourself unable to get rid of them. Some people have Hashbacks, or very vivid images, as if the trauma is occurring again. Nightmares are also common. These symptoms occur because a traumatic experience is so shocking and so different from everyday experiences that you can\\'t fit it into what you know about the world. So in order to understand what happened, your mind keeps bringing the memory back, as if to better digest it and fit it in. 3. Increased arousal is also a common response to trauma. This includes feeling jumpy, jittery, and shaky; being easily startled; and having trouble concentrating or sleeping. Continuous arousal can lead to impatience and irritability, especially if you\\'re not getting enough sleep. The arousal reactions are due to the fight or flight response in your body. The fight or flight response is how we protect ourselves against danger, and it also occurs in animals. When we protect ourselves from danger by fighting or running away, we need a lot more energy than usual, so our bodies pump out extra adrenaline to help us get the extra energy we need to survive. People who have been traumatized often see the world as filled with danger, so their bodies are on constant alert, always ready to respond immediately to any attack. The problem is that increased arousal is useful in truly dangerous situations, such as if we find ourselves fac- 27 ing a tiger. But alertness becomes very uncomfortable when it continues for a long time even in safe situations. Another reaction to danger is to freeze, like the deer in the headlights, and this reaction can also occur during a trauma. 4. Avoidance is a common way of managing trauma-related pain. The most common is avoiding situations that remind you of the trauma, such as the place where it happened. Often situations that are less directly related to the trauma are also avoided, such as going out in the evening if the trauma occurred at night. Another way to reduce discomfort is to try to push away painful thoughts and feelings. This can lead to feelings of numbness, where you find it difficult to have both fearful and pleasant or loving feelings. Sometimes the painful thoughts or feelings may be so intense that your mind just blocks them out altogether, and you may not remember parts of the trauma. ). Many people who have been traumatized feel angry and irritable. If you are not used to feeling angry, this may seem scary as well. It may be especially confusing to feel angry at those who are closest to you. Sometimes people feel angry because of feeling irritable so often. Anger can also arise from a feeling that the world is not fair. 6. Trauma often leads to feelings of guilt and shame. Many people blame themselves for things they did or didn\\'t do to survive. For example, some assault survivors believe that they should have fought off an assailant, and they blame themselves for the attack. Others feel that if they had not fought back they wouldn\\'t have gotten hurt. You may feel ashamed because during the trauma you acted in ways that you would not otherwise have done. Sometimes, other people may blame you for the trauma. Feeling guilty about the trauma means that you are taking responsibility for what occurred. While this may make you feel somewhat more in control, it can also lead to feelings of helplessness and depression. 7. Grief and depression are also common reactions to trauma. This can include feeling down, sad, hopeless, or despairing. You may cry more often. You may lose interest in people and activities you used to enjoy. You may also feel that plans you had for the future don\\'t seem 28 to matter anymore, or that life isn\\'t worth living. These feelings can lead to thoughts of wishing you were dead, or doing something to hurt or try to kill yourself. Because the trauma has changed so much of how you see the world and yourself, it makes sense to feel sad and to grieve for what you lost because of the trauma. 8. Self-image and views of the world often become more negative after a trauma. You may tell yourself, \"If I hadn\\'t been so weak or stupid this wouldn\\'t have happened to me.\" Many people see themselves as more negative overall after the trauma (\"I am a bad person and deserved this\"). It is also very common to see others more negatively and to feel that you can\\'t trust anyone. If you used to think about the world as a safe place, the trauma may suddenly make you think that the world is very dangerous. If you had previous bad experiences, the trauma may convince you that the world is dangerous and others aren\\'t to be trusted. These negative thoughts often make people feel that they have been changed completely by the trauma. Relationships with others can become tense, and it may be difficult to become intimate with people as your trust decreases. 9. Sexual relationships may also suffer after a traumatic experience. Many people find it difficult to feel sexual or have sexual relationships. This is especially true for those who have been sexually assaulted, since in addition to the lack of trust, sex itself is a reminder of the assault. 10. Some people increase their use of alcohol or drugs after a trauma. There is nothing wrong with responsible drinking, but if your use of alcohol or drugs has increased as a result of your traumatic experience, it can slow down your recovery and cause problems of its own. Many of the reactions to trauma are connected to one another. For example, a flashback may make you feel out of control and will therefore produce fear and arousal. Many people think that their common reactions to the trauma mean that they are \"going crazy\" or \"losing it.\" These thoughts can make them even more fearful. Again, as you become aware of the changes you have gone through since the trauma and as you process these experiences during treatment, the symptoms should become less distressing. 29 In Vivo Exposure In the first session with your therapist, you talked about confronting the memories of your traumatic experience with imaginal (in your imagination) exposure and in vivo (in real life) exposure and why they are helpful in recovering from the types of symptoms you are having. In this session, you and your therapist will review the rationale for in vivo exposure and talk about how confronting the situations you have been avoiding will help you overcome your PTSD. You will then begin to construct a list of situations that you\\'ve been avoiding, which will be good to practice for your in vivo exposure exercises. Remember that it is common for people to want to escape or avoid memories, situations, thoughts, and feelings that are painful and upsetting. This avoidance of upsetting experiences may make you feel better in the short run, but in the long run avoidance just feeds posttrauma reactions and keeps you from recovering from PTSD. There are several ways that in vivo exposure can help you get over your PTSD symptoms. First, you now have a habit of lowering anxiety by avoiding situations that cause you to feel bad. For example, if you are at home and you discover that you ran out of milk, you may say to yourself, \"I need to go to the supermarket to get some more milk.\" As you think this, you begin to feel very anxious. Then you may say to yourself, \"I can wait for my husband to come home and shop for the milk.\" As soon as you make the decision not to go shopping, your anxiety goes down and you feel better. Each time you decrease your anxiety by avoidance, your habit of avoiding gets stronger and stronger. Carefully confronting the situations that you currently avoid will help you get over your habit of reducing anxiety through avoiding. Second, when you put yourself in situations over and over that you have avoided because you thought that they were dangerous. and you find out that nothing bad happens, you learn that these situations are okay and you do not need to avoid them. But if you do not confront them, you will continue to believe that these situations are dangerous and you will keep avoiding them; you never give yourself the chance to learn differently. Thus, in vivo exposure helps you to better tell the difference between situations that actually may be dangerous or high-risk from those that are okay. If you felt 30 okay going to the grocery store alone before, then it is probably okay to do it now. Third, many people with PTSD think that if they stay in the situation that makes them anxious, their anxiety will stay high forever or even get worse until they lose their mind. However, if you stay in the situation long enough, you will find that your anxiety will go down. This process is called habituation. As a result of this process, your symptoms will go down as well. Fourth, confronting feared situations and getting over your fears will help your self-esteem and make you feel more competent, because you will know that you can cope better with your problems. You will start doing things that you used to like and that you stopped doing because of your PTSD, and you will begin to enjoy life and do more. For all these reasons we ask you to systematically confront relatively safe situations that you are now avoiding, beginning with easier ones and working your way up roward harder ones. Of course we do not suggest that you expose yourself to unsafe situations. The goal is not to help you see dangerous situations as safe but to keep you from avoiding situations that are realistically safe. In order to help you stop avoiding situations and people that used to be fun or important, we are going to work together to make a list of situations that you have been avoiding since the trauma. Your therapist will also want to find out from you how much distress or discomfort these situations would cause you if you weren\\'t avoiding them. Case Example 11: In Vivo Exposure Here is an example showing how in vivo exposure works. A little boy was sitting on the beach with his mother when an unexpected, huge wtwefrom the ocean washed over them. The childgot very upset and cried that he wanted to go home. The next day when it was time to go to the beach, the little boy began crying and refused to go. He kept saying, \"No, no. UJater come to me. \"In order to help him get over hisfiar ofthe water, his mother took him for walks on the beach over the nextfiw days. She would hold his hand andgradually helped him walk closer to the waters edge. By the end ofthe week the boy was able to walk into the water alone. With patience, practice, encouragement, andgradual exposure, his fiar ofthe water decreased. 31 Introduction to SUDS Case Example #2: In Vivo Exposure Here is another example that illustrates in vivo exposure. A taxicab driver who lived in New York had aflar ofdriving across bridges. This flar created serious problems with his work, since he was unable to drive people across bridges. Each time he was about to cross a bridge, he pretended that something was wrong with the taxi and called another cab to take his passengers. The taxicab driver, with the help ofa therapist, practiced driving over bridges every day. Within a week, he was able to go across the bridge with the therapistJOllowing him in another car. By the end of2 weeks, with repeated practice, he was able to drive over small bridges by himself. Hopefully these examples help you understand that confronting the things you are scared of in a careful and systematic way can help you get over your fear. Because you have experienced a traumatic event, you may need more time to confront fears related to your experience. But with time, practice, and courage you will be able to confront the things that now make you afraid. Some people tell us that they have been confronting situations but haven\\'t gotten any better. It is important to know the difference between occasional, brief exposure and deliberate, systematic, repeated, prolonged exposure to feared situations. Confronting your fears in a careful and systematic way as we describe is what helps you get over them. Confronting a situation once for a short period and getting out of there while you are still very afraid doesn\\'t give you a chance to learn that the situation is not dangerous and that anxiety does not remain forever. If you feel you have tried to confront these fears but haven\\'t gotten any better in the past, please talk about this with your therapist so together you can figure out what went wrong and how to do it differently this time. We want you to engage in therapeutic exposure. An exposure that still leaves you scared is not therapeutic. An exposure that helps you decrease your fear, like the little boy at the ocean or the taxi driver in the examples above, is therapeutic. You and your therapist will come up with a list of therapeutic exposures for you to practice. In order to find out how much discomfort or anxiety certain situations cause you, you and your therapist will use a SUDS scale. This 0-100 scale stands for Subjective Units of Discomfort. A SUDS rating of 100 indi- 32 cates that you are very upset, the most you have ever been in your life, and a indicates no discomfort at all. Usually when people say they have a SUDS level of 100, they may be experiencing physical reactions, such as sweaty palms, heart palpitations, difficulty breathing, feelings of dizziness, and intense anxiety. So a rating of 100 is really extreme. But because people are different, a situation that makes one person feel a SUDS level of 100 may not be that bad for someone else. This is why we call it a subjective scale. For example, imagine that you and a friend are standing near a deep pool, and someone pushes you both in the water. If your friend cannot swim, she may feel a SUDS level of 100. But if you can swim, or are not afraid of deep water, you may feel a level of zero. In order to make this SUDS scale fit you and your fears, you and your therapist will need to find our which situations represent different levels on the scale. Someone else\\'s example may help: a = Watching TV in bed, very relaxed 25 = Taking a bus across town 50 = Making a mistake and being asked to meet her boss and explain the mistake 75 = Getting a phone call from her child\\'s teacher 100 = Feeling like she felt during the worse moment of the trauma You and your therapist are going to be using SUDS ratings to monitor your feelings during the imaginal and in vivo exposures. In Vivo Exposure Hierarchy Construction Your therapist will ask you for specific examples of situations, people, and places that you avoid because of your traumatic experience. You and your therapist will record some of the situations you avoid and rate them on the SUDS scale in the session. You will be asked to take this list home with you and add to it any other situations you think of, and also rate how much anxiety and distress you think you will feel in these situations using the SUDS scale. It is important that the situations are easily available to you so you can do them over and over. Situations that require a 3-hour drive each way are un- 33 realistic for repeated practice. The situations should also be specific rather than generaL For example, \"going into a crowded street\" or \"going to a supermarket\" are not specific enough. It is important to say a specific street or a specific supermarket, and at; a specific time, because different streets and supermarkets and different times of the day may lead to different levels of anxiety. Also, going to the supermarket with a friend may be easier than going alone. There are three main types of situations that are often avoided by people with PTSD: 1. First are situations that you think are dangerous, not because they are really dangerous but because you now see the world as a dangerous place. Situations of this type may include walking alone in safe areas after dark, going to a party, going to crowded places, driving along a highway, and being in parking lots. 2. Second are situations that are reminders of the traumatic event, such as wearing the same or similar clothing as you were wearing at the time the trauma occurred, smelling odors or hearing music that were there during the incident, and riding in a similar car. These types of situations are avoided not because you see them as dangerous but because they trigger memories of the traumatic event and cause you to feel bad. These are often realistically safe situations, even though they may make you feel uncomfortable or upset. 3. The third type of situation includes things like being involved in sports, dubs, hobbies, and friendships; wearing makeup and dressing nicely; going to church or synagogue or meetings; visiting friends or inviting people to your home for a meal; and generally doing other activities that you used to enjoy but have stopped doing since the trauma. Practicing these is very helpful for people who are depressed or who avoid situations and activities because they lost interest in them after the trauma. To create your hierarchy, you will make a list of all the situations that you avoid or that make you feel uncomfortable using the In Vivo Exposure Hierarchy provided. 34 In Vivo Exposure Hierarchy Nrume: _________ Date: ___________________ Therapist: SUDS Anchor Points ~-~- 5~- I~ ~ SUD~ SUDS Ilem (S_.2) (Final Sell.)

In cases of assault, being around men you don\\'t know, especially those who somehow remind you of the assailant (e.g., a man of the same race) 2. Someone standing close or coming up suddenly 3. Being touched by someone (especially someone unfamiliar) 4. Doing something similar to the trauma situation (e.g., for motor vehicle accident survivors, driving or riding in a car) 5. Walking down a street or being out in the open 6. Being alone at home (day or night) 7. Going somewhere alone at night 8. Being in a crowded mall or store 9. Talking to strangers 10. Driving a car or being stopped at a stoplight II. Being in a parking lot 12. Riding in elevators or being in small, confined spaces 13. Reading about a similar event in the newspaper or hearing about it on television 14- Talking with someone about the trauma 15. Watching movies that remind you of the trauma (e.g., combat films. assault scenes) 16. Going to the area of town where the traumatic event happened 17. Riding public transportation 18. Hugging and kissing significant others 19. Sexual or physical contact 36 20. Listening to a song that you heard during the traumatic event or that was from that same time 21. Watching the news on TV 22. Wearing makeup or looking attractive 23. Going to a movie that has some violence 24. Taking an exercise class 25. Driving a car with unknown people and piles of unidentifiable material next to the road that you fear could be explosives 26. Coming upon a stopped car while driving and not being able to get around it 27. Smelling food or spices similar to those present during the traumatic expenence Safely Consi.derations When Constructing the In Vivo Exposure Hierarchy It is important that the situations you plan to confront during in vivo exposure are safe or low-risk. We do not want you to put situations that are dangerous or high-risk on your list. For example, we would not want you to walk alone in areas where drugs are sold or in a park where crimes are regularly committed. Instead, we want you to pick situations that trigger your anxiety but are realistically safe. For example, you could walk in a public park with another person, or plan to walk alone in a safe area of the city. In Vivo Assignments In vivo exposure will begin with situations that make you a bit anxious bur feel manageable (e.g., SUDS = 40 or 50), and then you will gradually progress up to the more upsetting situations (e.g., SUDS = 100). During the in vivo exposure exercise, you should plan to stay in the situation until your anxiety has a chance to go up (if it does) and then decrease significantly. We don\\'t want you or your body to feel relief when you leave a situation that you are practicing for exposure. Details of the situations like time of day and the people that are around can be adjusted to get the level of 37 anxiety during exposure that you are aiming for. For example, for Martha, going to the mall with her mother was SUDS of 60, while going alone was SUDS of 85. Although the time it takes to successfully complete an in vivo exposure will vary from situation to situation or person to person, in general, you may need to allow for 30 to 60 minutes of exposure time. Please refer to the Model of Gradual In Vivo Exposure provided in the following section to help you with your in vivo exposures. Model of Gradual In Vivo Exposure Directions Use this example to help you design your in vivo exposure assignments. It is important for you to stay in the situation for a long enough period of time that your anxiety can rise and then fall, or until there is a 5% decrease in your peak SUDS (Subjective Units of Discomfort, where  = no discomfort and 100 = panic-level discomfort). Write down your SUDS before and after the exposure using the In Vivo Exposure Homework Recording Form provided on page 41. Example: Going to a Shopping Mall I. \"Coach\" (a supportive friend or family member) goes with you to shopping mall and you walk around the mall together. 2. Coach goes with you to shopping mall and stays in a specific area of the mall while you walk around alone. 3. Coach goes with you to shopping mall and stays in a specific area while you walk into some stores alone. 4. Coach drives you to shopping mall and stays in parking lot while you walk around mall alone. 5. Coach drives you to shopping mall and leaves parking lot for an hour while you walk around mall alone. 38 6. You go to shopping mall alone and coach waits by a telephone in his or her home. 7. You go to shopping mall alone and don\\'t tell coach. In Vivo Exposure Homework We want to make sure that you remember that the goal of in vivo exposure is to help you to be able to be in and stay in situations that remind you of the trauma without having high anxiety that interferes with your life. This part of the program involves having you confront situations that make you feel anxiety and a need to avoid. For it to work, you\\'ll have to do a lot of exposure exercises, for a long period each time. It takes effort, time, and commitment, but it can produce excellent results. You and your therapist will go over your In Vivo Exposure Hierarchy and decide which situations you will confront for homework. It is best to have two or more situations for homework. You should start with situations that you rated between 40 and 50 on the SUDS scale. By the end of treatment, you should have practiced all the situations listed on your hierarchy over and over. When you are first practicing a situation, you may feel anxiety symptoms, such as your heart beating rapidly, your palms sweating, and feeling faint, and you may want to leave the situation immediately. But in order to overcome your fear, it is important that you stay in the situation until your anxiety decreases and that you realize that what you were afraid could happen (e.g., being artacked or \"falling apart\") did not actually happen. Once your anxiety has decreased a good deal, or by at least 5%, then you can srop the exposure and go on with other activities. However, ifyou leave the situation when you are still very anxious, you are again telling yourself that the situation is dangerous, that your anxiety remains forever, Of that something terrible is going to happen to you. And the next time you go into that situation, your level of anxiety will be high again. On the other hand, if you stay in the situation and realize that you are not really in danger, your anxiety will decrease, and eventually you will be able to go into it without fear. The more often you practice each situation on your list, the faster you will reach the point in which you will stop 39 Homework being anxious in those situations. You will go over the In Vivo Exposure Homework Recording Form with your therapist. You will use this form to rate your SUDS level before and after the exposure, as well as the peak, or highest, SUDS leveL You will be asked to rate your SUDS level on many occasions throughout the course of your treatment. You may photocopy the In Vivo Exposure Homework Recording Form or download multiple copies from the Treatments ThatWork Web site (http://www.oup.com/ us/ttw).

I I Session 3 III Goals II To review homework II To discuss the rationale for imaginal exposure with your therapist To do your nrst imaginal exposure to the trauma memory Imaginal Exposure Imaginal exposure, or revisiting the trauma memory in your imagination, is a procedure in which you will be asked to .go over the traumatic event while saying it out loud, in the present tense. It is meant to: II Help you get in touch with all of the important aspects of the tratima memory: what actually happened, what you were thinking, what you were feeling, and what bodily sensations you had. Help you get in touch with your emotions about the traumatic event. II Help you talk about the memory in your own words at your own pace. Prolonged or Multiple Incident Traumas For people with a ttaumatic event that lasted many hours or days or longer (e.g., a period of several days of captivity) or multiple incident traumas (e.g., repeated assaults, recurring childhood sexual abuse, multiple inci~ dents of combat), you will need to decide with your therapist which of the traumatic memories you will work on nrst. Typically, these are the memo~ ries that bother you most right now. In most cases, working on the most disturbing memory nrst will help you get over less upsetting memories. It is important to remember that even if you feel temporarily more upset after some exposure sessions, especially the early ones, this just means that you are beginning to emotionally process these memories. You are begin- 45 ning to heal from the trauma. If you are worried about how you will react, especially during the early sessions of imaginal exposure, it is fine to bring a supportive person with you to wait and drive home with you afterward. Rationale for Imaginal Exposure You and your therapist will spend most of session 3 helping you revisit and recount aloud the memory of your trauma. It is not easy to understand and make sense of traumatic experiences. When you think about the incident or are reminded of it, you may experience extreme anxiety and other bad feelings. The trauma was a very frightening and upsetting experience, so you tend to push away or avoid the painful memories. You may tell yourself not to think about it or that you just have to forget it. Other people often advise you to do the same. Also, your friends, family, and partner may feel uncomfortable hearing about the trauma, and this may influence you not to talk about it. But, as you have already discovered, no matter how hard you try to push away thoughts about the trauma, the experience comes back to haunt you through distressing thoughts and feelings, nightmares, and flashbacks. We view these reexperiencing symptoms as a sign that the trauma is still \"unfinished business.\" In this treatment our goal is to help you to process the memories connected with the trauma by having you remember them for an extended period. Staying with these memories, rather than running away from them, will help you process and digest the memory and put it in the past. You will learn that remembering the trauma, although painful and unpleasant, is not dangerous. This. will also decrease the anxiety and fear that are linked with the memory. It is natural to want to avoid painful experiences such as memories, feelings, and situations that remind you of the trauma. However, the more you avoid dealing with the memories, the more they disturb your life. Our aim is to have you control the memories, instead of having the memories control you. In order to explain to you why it is so difficult yet important to process the traumatic memory, let\\'s look at an example: Suppose you have eaten a very large and heavy meal (or spoiled food) and now you have a stomachache, nausea, etc. These will stay until you have digested the food, but afterward, you will feel great relief. Flashbacks, night- 46 mares, and troublesome thoughts continue to occur because you have not digested the traumatic memory. Today you are going to start digesting or processing your heavy memories so that they will stop interfering with your daily life. Another way to explain why it is so difficult to digest and process a traumatic memory is by the following example: Imagine thar your memory is like a big file cabinet. Past experiences are each filed into a proper drawer. In this way you organize your experiences and make sense of them. For example, you have a file for restaurant experiences. Every time you go to eat in a restaurant, you open the restaurant file and you know what will happen. This is the way in which you remember how to behave in a restaurant and what to expect. But traumatic events do not have a file. This is because unlike the restaurant experience, where you know exactly what will happen (you will be seated, given a menu, you will choose your food, get a check, and pay), traumas are unpredictable. Even if you have had several traffic accidents in which you were not injured, you never know how the next accident will end. In this way each trauma is unique and therefore needs much more effort to process. Part of recovering from a traumatic experience is being able to organize the traumatic memory and file it in long-term memory so you can move on with the business of your life. One more example, which is very helpful if you already think about the trauma all the time and can\\'t understand how imaginal exposure will be different or useful: Imagine that your traumatic event is recorded in your brain like a book, with paragraphs, pages, and chapters. It is a book that has a story with a beginning, middle, and end. Because you have tried to avoid thinking about your trauma since it occurred, you have never read the book from the beginning to the end. Whenever you have a flashback, the book is opened to the paragraph where the flashback is written, and opening the book is painful and distressing. So you say to yourself, \"I don\\'t like this book,\" and you try hard to close it. The same thing happens when you have the next flashback or thought about your trauma. And this is why you have not read what is written in the book. In imaginal exposure, we will read the hook together from the beginning to the end. This will give you an opportunity to view the traumatic event and its meaning from your perspective today, knowing you made it out okay, rather than from the perspective of the past 47 when the trauma happened, when it was still terrifying. In this way, we will help you to make sense of a terrible experience that happened to you. So the goal of imaginal exposure is to enable you to have thoughts about the trauma, to talk about it, or to see triggers of it without getting so upset or anxious that it disrupts your life. It will always be a bad memory of something that should never have happened, but it doesn\\'t have to be so painful. This part of the program involves having you confront traumarelated memories that generate both anxiety and an urge to avoid. For it to work, you will do it over and over, for a long period each time. So there are several ways in which imaginal exposure will help you recover from your PTSD. Repeated revisiting and recounting of the trauma memories will: 1. Help you process and organize your traumatic memory and see it from the point of view of the present rather than from the point of view of the past when the trauma occurred. 2. Help you understand the difference between \"remembering\" the traumatic event and having it happen again. Many people tell us that when they think about the trauma they feel as if it is happening again, so it is no wonder that they are so anxious and upset when they think about the trauma. Fear is an emotion we have when we feel in danger. However, remembering a trauma that happened in the past is not dangerous. Going over the traumatic memory again and again helps strengthen this difference between the present (remembering) and the past (being traumatized) so that remembering the trauma does not make you so anxious and distressed. 3. Lower your anxiety. We call this habituation. When this happens, you learn that anxiety does not last \"forever\" if you stay in the memory rather than pushing it away. Generally, the more you confront the trauma memory, the faster you will habituate. 4 Help you see the difference between the specific trauma and similar but safe situations. For example, a rape victim may spread her fear of the assailant to men that remind her of the assailant. Repeatedly imaging the particular assailant (e.g., his blue eyes) will help her see the difference between that man and all other men, hopefully reducing the fear of men in general. 48 5. Help you to feel more in control and more competent. You will feel better about yourself as you stop avoiding and instead master your fears. You will learn that you can remember the trauma if you want to and put it aside if you don\\'t want to think about it. You also learn that you can be anxious and do it anyway. Conducting Imaginal Exposure Your therapist will ask you to recall the memories of the trauma. It\\'s best to start at a point in the memory that is a little bit before the trauma actually occurred, so that you have a chance to enter the image and get connected to it. So you may want to begin your story at a point that is at least several minutes before the situation got bad or frightening. You will then go on through the story of the trauma, up until the danger is over or you are our of the situation. It is best for you to close your eyes while you do this so you won\\'t be distracted and can picture it in your mind\\'s eye. Your therapist will ask you to recall these painful memories as vividly as possible and to picture them in your mind\\'s eye. We call this revisiting the trauma memory. Your therapist will ask you to describe the experience in the present tense, as if it were happening now, right here. You will recount aloud what happened during the trauma in as much detail as you can manage. You and your therapist will work on this together. If you start to feel uncomfortable and want to run away or avoid it by leaving the image, your therapist will help you to stay with it. From time to time, while you are revisiting the trauma, your therapist will ask you for your anxiety level on the 0-100 SUDS scale. Please just try to answer quickly with the first number that comes to mind to describe how you feel right then, not how you felt at that point in the trauma. Because it is important that you stay in the imaginal exposure for a lengthy period of time, when you finish recounting the trauma, your therapist will ask you to start all over again, without pause. You may do this several times within one session; the number of times depends on how long it takes you to go through the memory. It\\'s important that you do not push the memories away, even if they are painfuL Remember, memories are not dangerous, even if they feel bad. Your therapist will not say much in response to you until your imaginal exposure is done, but you\\'ll have time afterward to talk about your experience with it. 49 Processing the Imaginal Exposure After the imaginal exposure to your trauma memory you will have many emotions and thoughts. Therefore, it is important to begin processing this experience with your therapist. Your therapist will ask you to describe your thoughts and feelings about the imaginal exposure and to pay attention to what happened with your anxiety. Does it get any easier for you to talk about what happened? Do you start to think about things any differently? Even if it doesn\\'t seem to be getting any easier yet, you should be proud that you are sticking with it and allowing yourself to face these painful memories. That is probably a big change for you. You and your therapist will also talk about any important thoughts or beliefs that come up for you. Sometimes people will see things differently after going through the memory over and over. For example, many people realize that they could not have prevented the traumatic experience, or that it wasn\\'t their fault, or that they did the best they could. You and your therapist will also talk about any ideas that come out during exposure, such as blaming yourself, or not trusting people. Some questions to consider when looking at your thoughts about the trauma: When did you start viewing it this way? What makes you think this way? How do you feel when you think of it in this way? iii What would you tell your daughter/sister/friend if she were thinking this way? iii What would you tell your son/brother/friend if he had been through a similar experience? What does it mean to you that this happened to you? What does it say about you? Why do you think you currently have PTSD? How does it fit with what you\\'ve learned about common reactions to trauma? We have found that sometimes people are scared to express their feelings. Some people are afraid to cry because they think they will never stop. You may feel that you need to maintain control, and then you may do things 50 that interfere with processing the memory. For example, some people try ro avoid picturing very scary parts of their memories, such as the image of an oncoming car just before the crash, an assailant\\'s face, or being threatened with a weapon. It is good for you to remember that you are safe in the therapy room with your therapist and that what you are revisiting is a memory and is not happening now. Words of Encouragement Homework We know that confronting your fears can be hard in the beginning. If it weren\\'t, you wouldn\\'t need to seek this treatment. It takes courage, and we don\\'t use that word loosely. Courage is being scared and doing it anyway. But we know it is worth it. We have seen so many people go through this program or similar programs and feel like they finally can get back on track and get on with their lives that we know it is worth it. Your work here will payoff for the rest of your life. You will notice the difference, and your family and friends will notice the difference. But it can be hard in the beginning-going through the memory of what happened and staying with it and the feelings and then doing it over and over again. What helps is the knowledge that it will get easier. You\\'ve made the decision that you need help, so take it. Use this chance and make the most of it. We know you won\\'t be sorry. Good luck! You\\'re worth it! Please use the Homework: Sessions 3-10 form provided at the end of this chapter to track your homework assignments over the remaining sessions. Listen to the tape of imaginal exposure once a day. Note: you should not listen to the exposure tape before you go to sleep, because we don\\'t want to interfere with your sleep. Also, you should not let others listen to the tape because we don\\'t want you to have to deal with other people\\'s reactions ro it while you are trying to sort out your own reactions and feelings about it. And if you are letting other people listen to your tapes, you may leave out something important because you are worried how someone else would react to it. 51 ~ Record your reactions to the imaginal exposure using the Imaginal Exposure Homework Recording Form provided at the end of this chapter.

TIIII Anticipating and Solving Problems ~+ I I II\\' I III II dI Goals To learn about common problems that may interfere with treatment To learn ways of working through problems and difficulties Even with all of our experience working with survivors of trauma and using this treatment, and even with all the hard work of you and your therapist, sometimes it is difficult for people to get all they can out of PE. At this point in treatment, you have some sense of how you are responding and whether you are having any difficulties that might interfere with getting all that you want out of this program. Common problems that get in the way of treatment and your improvement include avoidance (our old friend, remember?); not being connected enough to your emotions (under-engaged) or being connected too much (over-engaged) during revisiting and recounting your traumatic memories; not tolerating your emotional distress; and persistently feeling other negative emotions, such as anger. Fortunately, if you and your therapist are aware of what\\'s happening, there are some things you both can do to help. Importance of the Treatment Model Emotional Processing Theory (PE) was described in chapter I of this workbook. It is important to keep this theory in mind when trying to solve problems and design the best therapy program for you. For example, a good in vivo exposure hierarchy is made up of situations that match your specific fears: that is, they make you feel fearful or distressed. Are the in vivo exercises right for you? Do they matter to you? Are they hitting the naHon the head ofyour fear or are you indifferent to them? Perhaps they don\\'t distress you? Keeping the theory in mind always helps when trying to plan and modify treatment. For example, a client who always gives a very quick account of her trauma memory during imaginal expo- 57 sures, and works hard to keep her feelings shut down while doing so, is most likely not bringing to mind all of the important pieces of her fear structure-she is avoiding the feelings, thoughts, or images that are associated with her trauma memory. If this happens to you, you need to remember why this avoidance, although understandable, interferes with your recovery &om PTSD, and work to find ways to increase your engagement with all the aspects of your trauma memory so that you can process it. Implementing Effective In Vivo and Imaginal Exposure Modifying In Vivo Exposure In session 2, you and your therapist created a list of situations, places, people, or activities that you fear and avoid (or suffer through if necessary, but as briefly as possible). Typically, people systematically move up the hierarchy, practicing each situation repeatedly until the anxiety or distress goes down and the person no longer sees the situation as dangerous or difficult. People with PTSD almost always struggle with avoidance during treatment. The urges to avoid are understandable, but as we\\'ve discussed repeatedly, avoidance maintains the trauma-related fear and anxiety. If you are struggling with doing your in vivo exposures, it is often useful to change your hierarchy by breaking each situation into smaller steps. If it becomes clear that an in vivo exposure situation is tOO hard to confront at the present time, find ways to make it less difficult or to reduce your SUDS leveL Sometimes having a ftiend or family member accompany you during the exposure exercise helps you manage your distress (as in the example you saw in chapter 4 of a woman progressing up through her in vivo exposure of going to the mall). Changing other factors like time of day or location of the exposure may also decrease the distress associated with the exercise and make it easier to do. When you have mastered the modified (easier) exposure situation, you can move on to the one that you could not confront and then to more difficult situations. Occasionally, as treatment progresses, a person may not experience a reduction in fear despite what appears to be good and repeated exposure. In these cases, it is helpful to look closely at what you are actually doing during the in vivo exposure exercises. Think about exactly how you are carry- 58 Modifying Imaginal Exposure ing out the exposure, how long it lasts, and when you end it. Do you stay in the situation long enough to allow your fear to decrease? Or are you escaping the situation while still very anxious? Look also for subtle avoidance and \"safety behaviors\" (e.g., being only with \"safe\" people, shopping only when the stores are less crowded, always choosing a female clerk or cashier to deal with, etc.) that may interfere with fear reduction by preventing you from realizing that the situations are not dangerous even when you do not do your safety behaviors. Finally, look for avoidance that you might not even be aware of. One client puzzled us because, although consistently doing her exposure homework between sessions, she was not habituating at all, and at midtreatment, her PTSD symptoms were higher than they were at pretreatment. When the therapist tried to understand this lack of progress by discussing it with the client, it became evident that the client was trying to keep herself emotionally detached while doing her homework. Also, whenever she wasn\\'t actually doing her exposure homework, she was completely avoiding all trauma-related triggers, thoughts, and feelings. She and her therapist hadn\\'t been aware of the extent of her avoidance. The therapist helped the client see how her avoidance was interfering with her treatment, and the client began to recognize and reduce her extensive avoidance behavior in daily life. As a result, her PTSD symptoms quickly began to improve. Another client reported doing her exposures as instructed, spending more time out and alone at night, without apparent benefit. When asked for details, it turned out she was preparing her keys in her hand before she raced from her car to the front door and could almost not get the door unlocked fast enough. When she quickly slammed the door, she felt as if she had narrowly escaped danger. We had to explain how conducting exposure in this manner was not therapeutic; it was important to let her mind and body learn that she had nothing to fear from the dark outside her front door. In PE, imaginal exposure, or revisiting and recounting the trauma memories, is conducted in such a way to get you emotionally engaged with the memory and with the feelings you get by facing the memory. Through repeatedly revisiting and recounting the trauma memory, the images, thoughts, and feelings that are associated with the memory are organized and integrated. In order to process and digest your traumatic experience, it is important to 59 Under-Engagement be emotionally connected with the memory and with the feelings triggered by it, but at the same time to not be overwhelmed with anxiety and to feel in control. The experience should help you learn that memories are not dangerous and that anxiety does not last forever. It is common for PTSD sufferers to shut down their feelings when thinking or talking abour a trauma. That is why the standard procedures for imaginal exposure are designed to encourage emotional engagement by asking you to keep your eyes closed, vividly imagine and visualize the traumatic scene as if it is happening now, use the present tense, and include the thoughts, emotions, physical sensations, and behaviors that you experienced during the traumatic event. The therapist prompts for details that are missing (i.e., \"What are you feeling as this happens?\" or \"What are you thinking as he says that?\") and monitors your distress level throughout the revisiting and recounting of the trauma memory. In our experience, the most frequent problem with emotional engagement is without doubt underengagement, or keeping the emotions at arm\\'s length. Much less frequently, the person becomes overwhelmed with emotions during imaginal exposure and feels a loss of control. We term this experience \"over-engagement.\" As used in PE, the term \"under-engagement\" refers to difficulty being in touch with the emotional aspects of the trauma memory. It is most commonly encountered in imaginal exposure but may also occur with in vivo exposure. In the case of revisiting and recounting the trauma memory, the person may describe her trauma, even in great detail, yet feel disconnected from it emotionally or not be able to visualize what happened. She may report feeling numb or detached. Distress or anxiety levels during the exposure are typically low when someone is under-engaged. However, the underengaged person could also report high distress levels (SUDS) even when it doesn\\'t look as though she is that upset. Sometimes the person who is under-engaged seems stilted or distant, as if she is reading a police report rather than giving a first-person account of a traumatic event. You can work to allow yourself to become emotionally engaged first by following the standard procedures of keeping your eyes closed and using the present tense. These procedures promote emotional connection to the memory. Make sure you include as much detail as you can, including bodily sensations, feelings, and thoughts (e.g., describe what you see; describe 60 Over-Engagement the room; describe how it smells; describe what you are wearing, what you are feeling, what you are thinking, etc.). It is important for you to remember that your memories are not dangerous, even though they are upsetting, and that recounting and visualizing the memory is not the same as reencountering the trauma and being traumatized again. Remember that being distressed is not dangerous. Our research findings show that being emotionally engaged with the traumatic memory helps recovery. Think about what you can do to help get around this wall you have built to protect yourself from your emotions. Unfortunately, there is no way to the other side of the pain except through it. Stick it out, let yourself experience everything you have to feel, and you can get to the other side. Protect yourself too much, and you may get stuck where you are. As used in PE, the term \"over-engagement\" refers to excessive emotional distress elicited by imaginal exposure to the trauma memory or by in vivo exposure to trauma reminders. Imaginal confrontation with frightening memories or images is usually upsetting, and most people cry and bec~me upset, especially in the early stage of PE. We want you to be able to learn from this experience that memories are not dangerous, even when they are painful, that you are not losing your mind, that you are not losing control, and that anxiety does not last indefinitely. If this is a problem for you, and you become so emotionally upset during the revisiting and recounting of your trauma that you don\\'t think you are learning that they are not dangerous, there are things that you and your therapist can do. Do you have difficulty maintaining a sense of being grounded and safe in the present moment? Does recounting the trauma memory feel to you as though you are actually reencountering the trauma? Are you having body memories or flashbacks during imaginal exposure? Are you able to respond to the therapist\\'s questions or directions? Do you feel detached or dissociated from present experience? Does it feel completely like you are back there and it is happening rather than telling the story in the therapist\\'s office? Do you feel stuck? In modifYing the imaginal exposure procedures, the primary goal is to help you to successfully describe some part of the trauma memoty while manag- 61 ing your distress and staying grounded in the present, knowing that you are safe. It does not mean not feeling upset, but it does mean that you are able to learn that revisiting your traumatic memory is not dangerous and that you can think about your trauma in new ways. A first step is to reverse or change the procedures that are designed to promote engagement: maybe keep your eyes open while describing the exposure scene, and use the past rather than present tense in narrating the trauma memory. Sometimes these two changes alone reduce engagement enough. It may be helpful to remind yourself that you made it through the trauma, and you can keep one foot grounded in your therapist\\'s office and the other foot in the memory and the imaginal exposure. An alternative procedure for people who are over-engaged is writing the trauma narrative instead of talking about it. This can be done in session and also as homework between sessions. If you try this, write down what happened, and include the thoughts, feelings, actions, and sensations as well as events of what happened. When done in session, as you are able to write the trauma narrative and begin to show signs of feeling more in control, you can then read the narrative out loud. Other Obstacles to Successful Exposure Avoidance Confrontation with feared situations or stimuli always triggers urges to escape or avoid, so avoidance is the most commonly encountered problem for effective exposure both in and out of the therapist\\'s office. The middle phase of treatment is often difficult for some people. This is sometimes the \"feeling worse before you feel better\" stage of therapy. When you are really having a hard time with wanting to avoid, keep in mind that this is part of the PTSD and exactly why you went into treatment. If it were easy, you would have done it already. Remember that while avoidance reduces anxiety in the short term, in the long run it maintains fear and prevents you from learning that the avoided situations (or thoughts, memories, impulses, or images) are not harmful or dangerous. As we mentioned above, you may need to take a close look at the in vivo exposure exercises and break them down into a more gradual progression. 62 We sometimes describe this struggle as sitting on a fence between exposure and avoidance. We know it is difficult to get off the fence, but sitting on it keeps the fear and slows progress. We encourage people to  choose to feel\" anxiety in the service of mastery and recovery, rather than only having it triggered against one\\'s will. A core aim is to learn that while anxiety is not comfortable, it is not dangerous, and that treatment involves learning to tolerate the anxiety triggered by exposures or by not avoiding. Finally, it may be helpful to remember why you went for treatment in the Brst place (i.e., the ways in which your PTSD symptoms interfere with your life). Keep yourself motivated, even in the rough spots. Anger and Other Negative Emotions While exposure therapy was originally conceived as a treatment for the reduction of excessive or unrealistic anxiety, our experience over years of treating PTSD sufferers has taught us that PE facilitates the emotional processing of much more than fear and anxiety. Strong emotions are often stirred up and activated in the process of PE. People often report feelings of anger, rage, sadness, grief, shame, and guilt when revisiting the traumatic memory and at other points in processing their traumas. Of these, anger has probably had the most attention. Although it is normal and justified to feel anger when thinking about your trauma, it is not good to get stuck in it. We have found that for many people it seems easier to feel anger than fear or sadness. Think about how angry you are and whether that is holding you back. Think about what you might need to do to get past that anger. Remember that even though exposure therapy may not be for everyone, it has received stronger evidence in support of its efficacy in reducing PTSD than any other treatment and should be considered a first-line intervention unless ruled out for some reason. We feel strongly that even when problems come up, if possible, find a way to keep PE as the focus of your treatment. Reducing PTSD, depression, and related symptoms, as well as increasing your sense of confidence and self-efficacy, will help you to cope better now and in the future. We know it\\'s tough, but we know it\\'s worth the effort. Stick with it and do all you can to get the most out of this opportunity. 63  Intermediate Sessions W I ! J (Session 4 to the end oftreatment) Goals Homework Review To review homework To revisit and recount your traumatic memory using imaginal exposure Starting about session 5, you will focus on \"hot spots\" (the parts of the memory that are still causing the most distress and anxiety) more as therapy goes on. To discuss the experience of revisiting the trauma memory II To discuss in vivo exposure To plan the next week\\'s homework By this point in therapy, we hope that you understand how confronting the memories of your trauma and safe situations that remind you of the trauma can help you get past what happened to you. We hope you are spending hours every day working on your homework, to help your processing along. You should be listening to the tape of the imaginal exposure every day. Don\\'t just \"listen\" passively, but really connect to the imaginal exposure like you do iIi session with your therapist. You should practice the imaginal exposure in a quiet, private place where no one else can hear the tape playing. Your eyes should be dosed during the duration of the exposure. Be sure you are in a place where you feel safe keeping your eyes dosed for this long. Try to picture in your mind\\'s eye what you are describing on the tape, letting yourself feel everything that it triggers and staying with the images and memories and feelings. You should give yourself a few minutes after the imaginal exposure to process the experience for yourself, thinking about how your reactions are changing and what you still need to work on. Is your anxiety getting less? Are you feeling angry? Are you feeling de- 65 Imaginal Exposure pressed? Are you still blaming yourself? Have you begun to let yourself off the hook and realize you did the best you could? Dont try to force how you think you \"should\" be thinking about it, but do stay open to allowing your thoughts and feelings about it to change. Don\\'t be surprised if you find yourself feeling less distressed about things that have always been very disturbing to you. It doesn\\'t mean that the occurrence of the trauma was not important, it means that the impact it has in your life NOW is lessening. Are you putting as much effort as you could be into doing the in vivo exposure exercises? We know they are time consuming, but it is true that the more time you put into it, the more benefit you will get out of it. This treatment program is not very long, best described in weeks rather than months, so putting in as much effort as you can while you are going through it will payoff. Are you noticing the in vivo exposure exercises getting easier? You need to pat yourself on your back for all the work you are putting into this. Starting at about session 4 or 5, when you and your therapist are working in the session on your revisiting the memory of what happened to you (imaginal exposure), your therapist will ask you to slow down during the recounting of your trauma and focus in more detail on what you are seeing, hearing, and feeling. You will still give your SUDS ratings every 5 minutes. As usual, you should just callout your rating as quickly as possible and don\\'t leave the image. Just as before, you will close your eyes and try to vividly imagine what happened at the time of the trauma. Use the present tense, as if it were occurring now, and include what happened and what you were feeling and thinking as you went through this experience. At this point in your work, you should be including all details. If it is in your memory, please say it out loud. Don\\'t worry about what it sounds like. You will continue imaginal exposure for 30-45 minutes withour interruption, until your distress levels decrease. This can take a while. In fact, sometimes it takes several sessions of imaginal exposure before people begin to experience a decrease in distress levels or to \"habituate.\" If this happens to you, the important thing to remember is that this does not mean you won\\'t get better or won\\'t benefit from the treatment. Our studies have shown that people get better at different rates and that not feeling better by the end of 66 a session of imaginal exposure does not mean that you will have a worse outcome from therapy. Are you having any difficulty letting go of your feelings during the imaginal exposure? Remember that you are safe in your therapist\\'s office and that an important part of revisiting trauma memories is the connection to the feelings that are associated with them. Remind yourself that memories are not dangerous even if they make you feel upset or anxious. You are stronger than your memories. As the therapy progresses (starting about session 5), it will be useful to focus on \"hot spots\" more and more. Hot spots are described in the next section. Hot Spots Up to this point, each time you have done your imaginal exposure, you have described the entire memory of what happened to you. And we hope that you have been making progress and have begun to experience the decrease in anxiety that we expect to see, at least with some of the relatively less disturbing parts of the memory. When you reach this point, you and your therapist are going to do the imaginal exposure a little differently. When someone starts getting the benefit of habituation to some aspects of the trauma experience (as we said above, these are usually the relatively less distressing parts of the memory), we begin using a different procedure that helps to emotionally process the most difficult moments. You and your therapist will discuss, based on your last exposure and on your listening to the imaginal exposure tape for homework, what the most upsetting parts of this memory are for you now. And then starting in your next session (probably around session 5), rather than going through the entire memory from beginning to end, your therapist will ask you to focus the revisiting on each of these \"hot spots,\" one at a time. You will pick one to begin with and you will repeat that one part of the memory over and over just by itself, focusing in closely and describing what happened in great detail, as if in slow motion, including what you felt, saw, heard, and thought. You will repeat it as many times as necessary to \"wear it out\" or allow a big decease in your SUDS level. When that part seems to have been sufficiently processed, you will move to the next one. It is similar to what sometimes happens during a massage when they work on a knot over and over until it 61 is smoothed out. One of our patients said it was like listening to a record with skips and we worked on the skips so it didn\\'t skip anymore and played all the way through smoothly. Another likened it to directly cleaning a wound that had caused infection in the entire body after antibiotic treatment had begun to work and make her feel better overall. When your hot spot work is completed and you can visualize and describe all of these worst spots without much distress, you will return to focusing on and describing the entire trauma memory, putting it all back together. This should be done in the last session or two of treatment. Remember, one of the goals of PE is to have you emerge from the therapy with a wellorganized and whole story of what happened ro you, complete with the thoughts and feelings you had at the time. For some people with more than one trauma or with a trauma that happened more than once (e.g., childhood sexual abuse or repeated incidents of combat), it may also be necessary to focus the imaginal exposure on several traumatic memories. We suggest that you do not move on to another trauma memory until you and your therapist have seen some progress with the first memory. Because we try to focus the initial revisiting on the \"worst\" trauma memory or the one that seems to be causing the most reexperiencing symptoms, the benefits of working through this memory often transfer to the other trauma memories so that they are not as bad when you start working on them. But if any other memories are still very upsetting, you may want to work on these as well. You and your therapist will discuss this and decide together whether or not it seems necessary. Processing the Imaginal Exposure As described in detail in session 3, you will process the imaginal exposure with your therapist after you have finished revisiting the trauma. This is where you will talk about the experience of revisiting and recounting the trauma memory, how you are thinking and feeling about the trauma, any changes you are noticing as you process the memories, and what meaning the trauma has in your life now. You will talk about how it has affected your life and how your thoughts about it may be changing. You will also talk about what you need to keep working on. Usually, as treatment progresses, people develop new perspectives on the trauma. These new perspectives are often more realistic, and the memory of the trauma becomes less likely to 68 In Vivo Exposure Homework trigger strong feelings of distress or anxiety. Other negative emotions that are connected to the trauma-sadness, shame, anger, and guilt, for exampleoften decrease as welL Although the goal of revisiting the trauma memory is not to recover forgotten memories, sometimes new material does emerge in the hot spot work as people identifY the most terrifYing moments of the traumatic incidents, e.g., \"I thought the next time my parents would see me would be in a coffin,\" or \"I was worried he would hit me in the eyes and blind me and then, even if I survived, I\\'d never be able to work again.\" It is important to focus the revisiting on these difficult moments, too, and to talk about them with your therapist. You should continue your daily in vivo exposure homework assignments and should be moving up the in vivo hierarchy as treatment progresses. You should continue to practice each exposure item until it becomes easier, ideally until it produces only mild anxiety or discomfort. As your anxiety decreases and your confidence increases, we encourage you to do as much as you can to \"take back\" your life and to find ways to do in vivo exposure in day-to-day life. ~ Continue breathing practice. Listen to the tape of that week\\'s imaginal exposure once a day. Note: you should not listen to the exposure tape before you go to bed, because we don\\'t want to interfere with your sleep. Also, you should not let others listen to the tape because we don\\'t want you to complicate your recovery by having to deal with other people\\'s reactions while sorting out your own. And if you are allowing other people to listen to your tapes, you may leave out important parts of your story because you are worried about how someone else would react to it. Finally, each week, we would rather you listen to the imaginal exposure from the session you most recently had, an,d not go back and listen to the earlier sessions of the trauma recounting. This is because as 69 your therapy progresses, the way that you describe and think and feel about your trauma will likely shift and change. It\\'s important that you move forward as your trauma processing moves forward. ~ Record your reactions to the imaginal exposure using the Imaginal Exposure Homework Recording Form (see p. 54). ~ Continue with in vivo exposure exercises daily, working up the hierarchy with SUDS levels and recording your practices on the In Vivo Exposure Homework Recording Form (see p. 41). ~ Listen to audiotape of each session once. 70 Final Session Goals II To continue revisiting and recounting your trauma via imaginal exposure II To review your progress in treatment with your therapist and discuss continued practice II To wrap up your therapy Imaginal Exposure In this last session, you will spend about 20-30 minutes in imaginal exposure. You will go through the entire trauma memory in this session, rather than working on hot spots. It is important to go through the beginning. middle, and end ofyour story. At this point in your therapy, it is likely that L the way you\\'re thinking and feeling about the trauma has changed, and your story will reflect this. When you finish the imaginal exposure, you will t talk about the experience {\"processing\"} as you have done before. However, in this discussion, it is helpful for you and your therapist to also talk about how the imaginal exposure has changed for you over the course of therapy. Do you remember how you felt the first time you revisited and recounted this traumatic memory? How does it feel to do this today as comparc;d to then? Has anything else changed about the memory or what the trauma means to your life now? Do you view the trauma experience differently than you did before? Review of the Skills You Have Learned in This Program Although we expect that you are feeling much better, we want to prepare you for \"blips\" in the future. There may be times in the future when it feels as though your PTSD symptoms are coming back or seem to be worsen71 ing. This might happen at times of stress, or maybe during times of change. Moving, getting a new job, getting married, having babies, children moving out, children getting married are all generally happy times, but they can be stressfuL Vour body has learned to react to extreme stress with PTSD symptoms, and you may notice some of these symptoms in the future. If you notice any of these symptoms, such as having an increase in intrusive thoughts or images of the trauma, withdrawing from others, avoiding trauma reminders, feeling very irritable, or having trouble sleeping, it will be important for you to pay attention to them. Pay attention to your habits and make sure you are doing what you have learned worked well to reduce your symptoms. Think about, and write down in this workbook, which skills worked best for you and what you need to remind yourself in the future. After all the work you have done, it is important to review your progress in the program and take stock of the skills you have learned. You have spent a great deal of time and effort working with your therapist and doing hours of homework to help you process what happened to you during the trauma. In addition to repeatedly recounting the trauma memories in detail, you have spent a lot of time doing in vivo exposure exercises to help you approach people and situations that became frightening for you after the trauma or just felt unsafe somehow. This is a good time to think about how you are feeling now, what you found helpful or not helpful during treatment, what additional skills you need to learn, and your plans for the future. Your therapist will use the in vivo hierarchy list you made together in session 2. When your therapist reads each item on the list, try to imagine yourself doing each of these things right now and what that would feel like. Your therapist will ask for your SUDS levels for each situation on the list if you did it now. You will then together go over the list and compare the ratings you made in session 2 to the ratings you made in the last session. We think you will be pleasantly surprised! For almost everyone going through this program, the SUDS levels go down a lot. Think abour what that means for you. Think about how you did it, and what you learned about yourself and the world in the process of this program. Think about how hard it was, and how things have changed. Remember how hard you worked. You\\'ve earned those lower SUDS! Look carefully at the list and the \"before\" and \"after\" ratings and see what you can learn. Which are the situations that went down the most? Talk 72 about what you did to cause those changes. Is there anything that you rate near\"0\" now? We bet those are the situations you practiced a lot. Many people we work with wouldn\\'t have thought when they started that it was possible to have some of these situations not bother them at all anymore. Which are some of the situations that didn\\'t change as much? Why do you think these are still relatively anxiety provoking for you? What can you learn about those and what do you think you need to do? For many people, those will be the situations that they didn\\'t practice as much. Just because you are finishing up with yout therapist does not mean you will stop your exposure exercises. Just the opposite! You need to keep up your new good habits. If any of these situations are still bothering you, you need to work hard on them with in vivo exposure homework just like you did on the other situations during therapy. Your therapist can help you come up with a plan for tackling these situations. Also, you should be watchful for any increases in anxiety associated with the activities or situations you confronted during the therapy. If you see such an increase, what should you do? (Hint: what did you do that got you better?) Please remember that what you have learned in this program is an approach, and it involves just that-approaching. Don\\'t avoid something because it is upsetting. To get over it, there is no way to the other side except through it. You need to keep practicing this approach, keep facing your fears, and keep doing the work, even when it gets hard or scary-especially when it gets hard. You have worked so hard and been through so much to get to this place, but these are new habits that need continued practice. Some people at the end of therapy feel as though they are on a fence and could go either way at this point. We encourage you not to fall back into old habits of avoidance. It\\'s like an exercise program to get into shape. If you work hard and achieve your goals but then stop exercising and eating well, you will slide back into old habits and may lose the gains you\\'ve made. One of our PTSD clients who was also recovering from her alcohol dependence said in the final session of her therapy, \"I feel like I\\'ve been retrained and been given new skills and a new way to deal with things. It\\'s just like my alcohol program-these two things go together-every day I need to just keep working this program the way I work my alcohol program.\" She was exactly right! And you, too, need to keep practicing exposure, staying with the upsetting memories, feelings; and situations that are realistically safe until you feel better about them. 73 Graduation We really want you to take stock of al1 that you\\'ve learned over this therapy and think about what helped you to feel better. Here are several questions to think about and discuss with your therapist: III How did you accomplish these changes? What did you do in this therapy that brought about this difference? What have you noticed about your level of anxiety or discomfort in certain situations? What have you learned? What have you found most helpful to manage that anxiety and discomfort? Are there any problems that you are still concerned about? What do you think you need to do about these? You should keep practicing the skills that you learned in therapy over the next several months very deliberately. If you run into problems, we encourage you to call your therapist for a booster session. We know that this type of work can be emotionally intense for both you and your therapist, so, not surprisingly, ending therapy can be difficult for people. Hopefully, you have come to trust your therapist and you have gotten through some intense work together. Take the time you need to say goodbye and think about what you have learned from this relationship. For many trauma survivors for whom trust was a huge issue, it can be very surprising that they have come to share such intimate details of a traumatic experience and have learned to trust their therapist so much. If this was true for you, this is a wonderful lesson for you. Isn\\'t it good to know that you can trust someone again, that they can be there for you, and that you can let them be there for you? We hope you can apply this lesson to your other relationships or future relationships. Again, take stock of what you have accomplished and what still needs some work. How helpful was the brea~hing relaxation for you? How often did you practice the imaginal exposure (listening to the tape) and how did it go for you? Did yout feelings change? What made it easier? Did yout 74 thoughts change? How otten were you able to practice the in vivo exposures? What more should you still work on? Importantly, what advice would you give someone you cated about who was thinking of going through this program? In addition to being surprised that they could trust someone else, many people we have worked with are surprised that they could trust themselves, maybe again, maybe for the first time. We think in some ways, this is what this program is all about: gaining confidence in yourself and learning to trust that you can handle what life throws you. Congratulations! You should be very, very proud of yourself. We know what hard work this is, and you have made some great accomplishments. We are proud if this book, this program, and our experiences have helped you on this journey. Good luck! Safe travels! Approach the rest of your life with confidence!   What Is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder? People who have obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) experience recurrent obsessions and/ or compulsions that are severe enough to cause considerable distress and to interfere with the person\\'s functioning at work, in social activities, in family and social relationships, or in everyday activities. Obsessions are unwanted, intrusive thoughts, ideas, urges, impulses, or worries that run through a person\\'s mind over and over again. Often the intrusive ideas are senseless, unpleasant, and quite distasteful; they produce fear, guilt, apprehension, sadness, or simply discomfort. Common obsessions include repeated impulses to kill a loved one; worries about dirt, germs, contamination, infection, and contagion; recurrent thoughts that something has not been done properly even when the individual knows it has; blasphemous thoughts or excessive concerns about following religious rules; sexual thoughts about doing something repugnant; fears of losing something important; ideas that certain things must always be in a certain place, position, or order; fears of being responsible for harming someone or something; and magical numbers, colors, images, or prayers that might cause harm or discomfort. Other types of ideas or images might also be obsessions if they come into mind repeatedly and are unwanted. The wide variety and sometimes unusual types of obsessions can make OCD difficult to identify. Also, because some types of intrusive ideas seem like obsessions but are not, it\\'s important to consult a mental health professional familiar with this disorder who can make a careful diagnosis. Compulsions or rituals are repeated behaviors or mental actions that are used to reduce anxiety or discomfort caused by an obsession. The goal in doing a ritual is to undo or \"neutralize\" the obsession. Most people recognize that these rituals are excessive but still feel compelled to do them in a particular way according to their own rules. Common compulsions include hand washing, showering, bathing, tooth brushing and grooming, cleaning household items, touching certain objects, checking drawers, locks, and appliances, and going back and forth through a door or repeating an action to undo a thought or image, placing things in a certain order, collecting and saving items so that nothing of value will be lost, having to do something exceedingly slowly to feel that it has been done properly, and seeking reassurance that something has or has not happened. Many people with OCD also have mental rituals like praying, repeating phrases in their mind, mental list making, substituting a good thought for a bad one, or taking back a bad thought. Just as obsessions vary in their frequency and intensity, compulsions may occur only rarely or consume many hours each day. Compulsive behaviors do not provide pleasure (like gambling or smoking or drinking alcohol); OCD sufferers do them to reduce tension, discomfort, or anxiety associated with obsessions. Most people with OCD also avoid a variety of situations that they consider likely to provoke obsessions or rituals. Examples for someone with fears of contamination by dirt and germs are avoiding public rest rooms or shaking hands. Avoiding the stove and other appliances would be common for someone with fears of causing harm and with checking rituals. Although most people clearly recognize that their fears are irrational, this attitude is often hard to maintain when the person is in the middle of an obsession and feels highly anxious or very guilty. What Else Is Known About OeD? OCD was once thought to be relatively rare in the population, but recent community studies show that mild forms of the disorder may be relatively common. It is now estimated that about 2 percent of the population (one in fifty people) suffers from OCD. Childhood onset of OCD is common, but childhood symptoms often disappear and may reappear in a different form during adolescence and young adulthood. For women, the average age of onset is in late teens and early twenties and for men, it begins in early to middle teenage years. Men and women are affected almost equally, but slightly more women seek treatment. Most people with OCD wait an average of ten or more years after symptoms begin before seeking treatment. However, as information about psychiatric conditions has become more available and less stigma is associated with receiving psychOlogical therapy, OCD sufferers are seeking treatment earlier. OCD is typically a chronic condition that may wax and wane over time. The sufferer may go to great pains to hide the problem so that the disorder goes unnoticed, even by family members. However, when symptoms substantially impair a person\\'s social, occupational, and family functioning, OCD is very difficult to hide. In some cases, compulsions may become the major life activity. Many people with OCD also have another type of problem, such as depression, other anxiety disorders like social phobia and panic disorder, or Tourette\\'s syndrome in which the person experiences uncontrollable motor or verbal tics. When depressed mood and feelings of hopelessness are very severe, depression may require treatment before treatment for the OCD begins. Some OCD clients also suffer from panic attacks in situations that trigger their obsessive fears. These are brief periods of high anxiety and associated physical symptoms, like heart racing, shortness of breath and dizzinessl that are upsetting and can seem catastrophic at the time. If these panic symptoms in obsessive situations are especially troublesome, the person may need help learning to control panic before beginning treatment for obsessions and compulsions. Likewisel conditions such as Tourette\\'s syndrome will require additional interventions, usually medications, prior to or at the same time as 2 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder treatment for OCD. Some people with OCD who are overly sensitive to sensory experiences and tend to avoid social contact and have unusual beliefs or perceptual experiences or suspicious ideas may benefit from specialized behavioral treatments provided in settings that help reduce feelings of being emotionally overwhelmed. These kinds of additional treatments should be discussed with a therapist. How Does OeD Begin? Researchers have demonstrated that 85 to 90 percent of people have intrusive thoughts that are similar to those experienced by people with OCD. Obsessions are merely exaggerated versions of these normal mental intrusions. In fact, normal intrusive experiences are quite similar in their nature and content to those of OCD sufferers. This is clear from the types of mental intrusions reported by a group of ordinary people in the list below. Why do some people go on to develop OCD while others do not? One important difference between people who develop OCD and those who don\\'t is how they react to the intrusive thoughts. People who don\\'t develop OCD tend to realize that, although their intrusive thoughts are odd or unexpected, they don\\'t have any special significance or meaning. Because of this, the intrusions don\\'t disturb the person very much, and they occur less frequently and are easier to dismiss. Obsessions Reported by a Nonclinical Sample Impulse to hurt or harm someone Thought of intense anger toward someone, related to a past experience Thought of accident occurring to a loved one Impulse to say something nasty and damning to someone Thought of harm to, or death of, dose friend or family member Thought of acts of violence in sex Thought that something is wrong with her health Impulse to physically and verbally attack someone Thought of harm befalling her children, especially accidents Thought that probability of air crash accident to herself would be minimized if a relative had such an accident Thought whether an accident had occurred to a loved one Thought that she, her husband, and her baby (due) would be greatly harmed because of exposure to asbestos, with conviction that there are tiny asbestos dust particles in the house Thought whether any harm has come to his wife Impulse to shout at and abuse someone Impulse to harm or be violent toward children, especially smaller ones Introduction 3 Impulse to crash car when driving Impulse to attack and violently punish someone-e.g., to throw a child out of a bus Impulse to say rude things to people Thought about accidents or mishaps, usually when about to travel Impulse to push people away and off, in a crowd-e.g., a queue Impulse to attack certain persons Impulse to say inappropriate things-Uwrong things in the wrong place\" Impulse-sexual impulse toward attractive females, known and unknown Thought-wishing and imagining that someone close to her was hurt or harmed Thought of experiences many years ago when he was embarrassed, was humiliated, or was a failure Impulse to violently attack and kill someone Thought that she might do something dramatic like trying to rob a bank Impulse to jump from top of a tall building or mountain/ cliff Impulse to sexually assault a female, known or unknown Impulse to say rude and unacceptable things Impulse to engage in certain sexual practices that involve pain to the partner Impulse to jump off the platform when a train is arriving Thought of physically punishing a loved one Adapted from Rachman and DeSilva (1978). Copyright 1978 by Pergamon Press, Ltd. Adapted by permission. In contrast, people who develop OCD tend to respond to these intrusive thoughts as if they represent real threats and need to be taken seriously. They try not to think about the thoughts that bother them, but unfortunately, this has exactly the opposite effect. That is, efforts to suppress thoughts actually increase their frequency. In addition, those who are fearful of the intrusive ideas begin to avoid situations that might provoke the thoughts. This often doesn\\'t work, so the person tries to undo or neutralize them using behavioral or mental rituals. Unfortunately, avoidance and compulsive behaviors prevent the person from experiencing their thoughts fully and becoming used to them so that obsessions no longer provoke discomfort. In this way, obsessions and compulsions become quite entrenched, and the sufferer never has an opportunity to learn that simply tolerating the obsessions without avoiding or ritualizing eventually leads to reduction in the obsessive fears. Biological factors undoubtedly playa role in the development of OCD. People with OCD appear to differ in their brain structure and chemistry compared to those without this disorder. It also seems likely that OCD can be transmitted genetically, since the disorder occurs more often among identical than fraternal twins, and the rate of OCD symptoms among immediate family members is higher than would be 4 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder expected by chance. More information about biological factors can be found in the suggested readings at the end of this manual. OCD might be more likely to develop in people who hold certain types of strong beliefs or assumptions that they learned previously in their families through religious or cultural training, or from other personal experiences. Sometimes, early experiences with rigid teachings make people more vulnerable to some of the beliefs and attitudes described below. Many of the types of obsessions that people with OCD have are focused on \"gray areas\" in which some element of normal risk is present for everyone. However, individuals with OCD often err on the side of excessive caution and tend to overestimate the likelihood of harm in comparison to others. Sometimes, it seems that people with OCD assume that a situation is dangerous unless it is proven safe. Of course, guarantees of safety are nearly impossible to prove, because there is always the possibility of error. Because they overestimate threat, OCD sufferers often have difficulty tolerating ambiguous situations, and worry whether their decisions and actions are right. They may also underestimate their ability to cope with these kinds of potentially dangerous situations. Another problem with beliefs is that OCD sufferers attach too much importance to particular kinds of thoughts, mistakenly thinking that normal people don\\'t have these thoughts. They may also have a magical idea that simply having a thought or an urge to do something increases the chances that it will actually come true. Of course, if someone thinks that intrusive thoughts are very important and could lead to harm, they are also likely to think that it is necessary to control their thoughts and actions. Many people with OCD also assume too much responsibility for a variety of situations. They are often as concerned about failing to prevent a problem as about causing one, and they tend to think that the responSibility for harm is theirs alone, rather than shared with others. Assuming responsibility for so many situations produces guilt, and it is not surprising that compulsions are used to relieve this guilt. Finally, some people with OCD are also quite perfectionistic-they think they should try to find the right solution to every problem and they worry that even minor mistakes will have serious consequences. What Is the Effect of OeD on Families? OCD can have unfortunate effects on the quality of family life and on family communication. Over time, many family members begin to actually participate in rituals and they may avoid situations at the sufferer\\'s request. Often, family members are asked to provide frequent reassurance about obsessive fears. It is not very surprising that many family members become quite distressed and feel some responsibility for their afflicted relative\\'s difficulties. Some become frustrated, and are critical or even hostile toward the OCD sufferer, while others, especially parents, become overly involved and even take over chores and duties that would normally be the OCD person\\'s responsibility around the home. These reactions are all understandable, given the difficulty that OCD imposes on the sufferer and on family members. It is often helpful to involve family members in treatment, at least at some times, to enable them to have an opportunity to ask questions and decide what to do in difficult situations that can be upsetting for everyone. Introduction 5 Treatment of OeD Over the past twenty-five years the prognosis for OCD has improved greatly. At present, about 70 percent of people with OCD improve with available treatments. The most significant symptom relief comes from behavior therapy, cognitive therapy, and medications that affect the body\\'s serotonin system. Two main types of psychological therapy are very helpful for OCD: behavior therapy and cognitive therapy. These are described briefly below and are taught in detail in this manual. Information about medications is available in the suggested readings at the end of this manual or from a psychiatrist experienced in treating OCD. Essential Components of Behavioral Treatment An important goal of behavioral therapy is to disconnect obsessive thoughts, images, and impulses from the unpleasant fear and discomfort that they provoke. This is accomplished by exposure to situations that cause obsessions, so that the discomfort can gradually decrease. At the same time, the OCD sufferer must stop his or her rituals during the exposure and also stop avoiding situations that cause discomfort. Thus, the basic elements of behavioral treatment for OCD are: Exposure to feared obsessive situations and Prevention of rituals and avoidance behaviors These two parts of the treatment are applied simultaneously and gradually, depending on the person\\'s tolerance for discomfort. This manual focuses on applying exposure gradually using a list of feared situations that is carefully planned in advance with a therapist. This treatment has been used in many research studies with excellent results. During therapy sessions the therapist describes and often demonstrates how to do the exposures to make sure the sufferer is not avoiding obsessive situations. During this process, the therapist asks about discomfort levels regularly to ensure that the situation is manageable and a good choice for treatment. Exposure periods may last forty-five to ninety minutes and should result in a noticeable amount of improvement in discomfort. Each session usually begins with the previous exposure item and then progresses to new ones that are a little more difficult. Later sessions proceed in the same way, until all of the obsessive situations are confronted and anxiety is considerably reduced. It is rare for discomfort to disappear altogether, but most people notice considerable benefit that improves with time. In some cases it is helpful to do some exposures in imagination. In this case, the client and therapist plan imaginary scenes about the feared obsessions, and the therapist narrates parts of the scene while the client closes his or her eyes and imagines it in detail during treatment sessions. Just as for actual exposure, the sufferer is asked to keep imagining the scene until discomfort reduces noticeably. Loop tapes can facilitate exposure to some kinds of obsessions. With the help of the therapist, the client narrates the obsession onto a tape and replays this over and over. During and after each exposure session, the OCD sufferer is asked not to engage in any rituals or avoidances that might interrupt or undo the exposure expe- 6 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder rience. This is done gradually, so that no compulsions are allowed in connection with exposures that are the focus of treatment in that week or from previous weeks. The client is asked to minimize any rituals that occur in situations that have not yet been included in the exposure treatment. Regular homework assignments are given after every session, and usually these are very similar to what was done during the treatment visit. If it makes sense to the client and the therapist, a family member might be asked to help during some homework assignments. Records should be kept of all homework assignments and of how the sufferer felt during the process. This enables the therapist to monitor progress and help with any problems. Essential Components of Cognitive Therapy We know that exposure and prevention of rituals by itself changes some irrational attitudes and beliefs about OeD symptoms. For example, most people begin to think differently about the likelihood of danger and their ability to tolerate anxiety and cope with intrusive experiences. Some may also change their attitude toward intrusive experiences so that these no longer seem so odd or bothersome, and they stop trying to control them. But these and other types of problematic thoughts may not change enough to enable the sufferer to make the best progress or to maintain their gains after treatment ends. Because of this, the therapist may recommend cognitive therapy in addition to behavioral treatment. In cognitive therapy, the therapist helps sufferers examine their interpretations and beliefs to develop an alternative way to think about the intrusive experiences that is much less threatening. Several specialized cognitive therapy techniques can be useful in this process. Although this therapy is relatively new, some published research suggests that individual cognitive therapy with a skilled therapist is as effective as behavioral treatment. The essential components of cognitive therapy are: Identification of irrational beliefs and attitudes Questions to examine the logic of interpretations and beliefs Specialized techniques to help challenge beliefs and attitudes First, the therapist helps the client identify unreasonable interpretations and attitudes toward obsessive thoughts by repeatedly asking what the sufferer was thinking in an obsessive situation and what this means to them. For example, the therapist might ask, \"So if that happened, what would it mean to you?\" Also, the therapist asks clients to keep daily records of their thoughts to help them notice their thinking in various situations. Once the sufferer and the therapist understand what beliefs and attitudes commonly occur in obsessive situations, the therapist asks questions about the logic of the client\\'s explanation of his or her thinking. Sometimes, the therapist may play the role of devil\\'s advocate to help the client think clearly about the obsessions. The client is asked to think like a scientist in evaluating his or her own logic and the evidence for it and to conduct behavioral experiments to test predictions related to obsessive ideas. These experiments are often assigned as part of the exposures in behavioral treatment. Several additional techniques are also taught to help challenge interpretations and beliefs that the client thinks might be irrational. Examples of these are: Introduction 7 Learning to think about the entire range of an idea rather than just one small part of it Experimenting with the effects of trying to control obsessive thoughts compared to the effects of not interfering with these thoughts Calculating the real probability of all of the steps required for the obsessive fear of harm to actually occur Estimating all components of responsibility for a feared event, not just one\\'s own Thinking about an obsessive fear from different perspectives, especially that of a judge or jury that has to evaluate the evidence Examining the advantages and the disadvantages of holding different views of an obsessive situation Research Findings That Guide Treatment Benefit from Exposure and Prevention of Rituals More than twenty-five research studies have demonstrated that behavioral treatment reduces obsessions and compulsions. The benefits from this treatment persisted up to six years after treatment ended. Approximately 75 to 80 percent of clients can expect to benefit, and the majority of them are usually considered very much improved. Although most clients maintain their gains, some clients require additional treatment after the behavior therapy for OCD ends. Studies of serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) medications such as clomipramine, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, sertraline, and paroxetine have indicated that these medications by themselves partly reduce OCD symptoms for most OCD sufferers, but the amount of benefit may be slightly less than for behavior therapy. Adding these medications to behavioral treatment produces little additional benefit on average, but some sufferers find combined treatment quite helpful. Research has shown that the addition of special relapse prevention sessions to behavior therapy especially helps maintain improvement. These sessions help clients recognize potential obsessive problems and use coping skills to reduce anxiety after stressful experiences. Benefit from Cognitive Therapy Only a few studies have investigated the effectiveness of cognitive therapy for OCD symptoms. These studies show that cognitive treatment was quite effective by itself, even without behavioral therapy or medications. The most recent of these studies tested methods of cognitive therapy very similar to the ones included in this manual. In one of these studies, cognitive therapy produced excellent results that were slightly better than the benefits from behavioral treatment. Another study combined cognitive and behavioral treatments for clients who had obsessions and mainly mental rituals, which have previously been considered very hard to treat. The combined cognitive and behavioral treatment produced an 84 percent success 8 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder rate and therapeutic gains were maintained one year later. Therefore, research indicates that cognitive therapy can be quite helpful in reducing OCD symptoms. In this manual, cognitive methods are recommended as additions to exposure and ritual prevention. Goals of Treatment It is important to remember that the goal of treatment for clients with OCD is not to eliminate intrusive thoughts, images, or impulses, but rather to remove their sting. That is, if almost all ordinary people experience intrusions, then eliminating them is virtually impossible. A more reasonable goal is to reduce the frequency, discomfort, and rituals associated with intrusions, so that they are easier to dismiss as habitual meaningless thoughts and easier to cope with when they persist for more than a few minutes. Most people who are treated for OCD will notice a gradual and quite substantial reduction in the severity, frequency, and duration of OCD symptoms by the end of treatment, and many will continue to improve after treatment is over. Improvement in everyday functioning in areas such as work, social relationships, and family life often occurs more slowly. Most people find that stress exacerbates bad habits. Likewise, OCD sufferers will be prone to OCD symptoms in times of crisis. Also, biological factors, such as hormonal fluctuations accompanying pregnancy and menopause, may trigger OCD symptoms. Because of this, the last few treatment sessions address how to manage stressors and prevent the return of OCD symptoms. In some cases, a person might need some booster sessions to resolve increases in obsessions and compulsions. Generally, most OCD sufferers will need to continue to use the tools they learn in therapy to help them maintain their gains. Some clients may also suffer from other conditions that require additional therapy after the OCD treatment is completed, or they may need assistance with employment or social problems if these have been affected by the OCD. Generally, we recommend that clients work on one problem at a time to obtain the most benefit from therapy. The Format for Therapy Sessions Most behavioral and cognitive treatments for OCD require from fifteen to twentyfive sessions. This manual is deSigned for a sixteen-session treatment, but you and your therapist will need to determine together whether you need more or fewer sessions, depending on your response as treatment progresses. To design and carry out an effective behavioral and cognitive therapy for OCD, the therapist first collects detailed information about the client\\'s symptoms. Usually, the therapist will interview the client and his or her family members and ask the client to complete several questionnaires and to keep records of obsessive fears and compulsive behaviors. In the first few interviews, the therapist will make a diagnosis, identify the specific symptoms of OCD, and obtain information about historical and current features and effects of the disorder, about previous treatment, and about any other problems or resources that might be important in recovery from OCD. Usually, one or more family interviews will also be scheduled to learn about how family members may be involved in symptoms and their reactions to the OCD. The questionnaires and self- Introduction 9 monitoring provide additional information about the nature and severity of OCD and related symptoms to guide the treatment plan. Also, during the first few sessions of treatment, the client and family receive education about OCD and about the treatment methods. Then, the therapist and client design a hierarchy. This is a list of situations that provoke obsessions, arranged from least to most disturbing. As described earlier, exposure treatment begins with the least disturbing items and progresses to more difficult ones while the client gradually stops rituals associated with these situations. All of the exposures are planned ahead and carried out during and between sessions as part of the homework. After several sessions of exposure and prevention of rituals, the therapist may introduce cognitive therapy methods to help the client examine his or her reasoning when thinking about obsessive situations. As described earlier, several types of cognitive methods will be used to help clients examine their thoughts from different perspectives. Homework is an essential part of therapy. Without it clients cannot improve and learn enough skills to overcome their symptoms. Several different types of homework may be assigned, including exposure and blocking rituals between sessions and also recording and deliberately challenging thinking about obsessive situations. Sometimes family members might be able to assist with some homework assignments, but this will be planned during the therapy sessions. The therapist and client begin each session by reviewing the agenda for that day. This helps keep treatment on track, so that neither person becomes sidetracked onto other topics. For each treatment session the therapist reviews the homework and then moves on to working on the exposures and prevention of rituals scheduled for that session and to cognitive techniques that might be especially useful during exposure. After this, the therapist and client agree on the homework assignment and whether a family member should assist. Each session follows this general format, adjusting exposures and homework assignments to the client\\'s progress. Before treatment ends, one or more follow-up meetings should be scheduled to ensure that progress continues and any problems are resolved. The therapist will also assess the degree of improvement in OCD symptoms at the end of treatment. After treatment ends, the client should be alert to warning signs that may indicate the need for booster sessions. These signs are increased discomfort to old or new obsessive thoughts, increased avoidance, and mild recurrence of old rituals or the appearance of new compulsions. If this happens, clients should not become alarmed, since often only a few sessions are needed to resolve the problem. 10 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Getting Started Treatment Goals and Motivation The introduction to this manual indicated that the goal of treatment for OCD is not to eliminate intrusive obsessions, thoughts, images, and impulses, but to reduce their frequency and the discomfort that is associated with them. Also, treatment aims to reduce or eliminate rituals and avoidance of obsessive situations. Because a successful outcome of treatment requires significant effort from clients who come regularly to sessions and do their homework as best they can, it is very important to be sure that you are ready to work seriously toward these goals. Sometimes people are afraid of the treatment itself, afraid that they won\\'t be able to tolerate or cope with the therapy requirements or the discomfort. If this is your only concern, rest assured that the therapist will help you plan a treatment that suits your needs. Although sometimes you will feel uncomfortable, it is extremely unlikely that you will not be able to do the tasks, and you will always have an important role in deciding what the assignments are. The therapist will encourage you and help you find a pace that is feasible for you. But sometimes, OCD sufferers are ambivalent about treatment for other reasons. Some people come into treatment because their partner or another family member has pressured them into it. Unfortunately, a half-hearted effort because someone else insists will not produce enough change to make the effort worth the trouble. It\\'s important to think ahead to how you are likely to feel if you are successful in therapy and OCD is no longer a significant problem for you. Do you have anything to lose if your symptoms improve a lot? Some things you might lose are money, a special role in your family, and protection from duties and responsibilities that might seem overwhelming. For example, some people with OCD have applied for and are receiving disability payments because of their symptoms. If OCD improves along with everyday functioning, these payments are likely to stop. Sometimes, people with OCD are treated specially by their family members who take over their jobs and responsibilities; if OCD improves, they might be expected to resume doing these chores. Also, sufferers are sometimes worried about their ability to function effectively in a work setting or in social situations; if OCD prevents this now, then improvement in these symptoms might mean having to face these other problems. This can be quite scary, especially since no one knows in advance how they will feel and whether they will be able to cope with fears and learn new skills to feel more competent. If you feel ambivalent about treatment, be sure to discuss this with your therapist honestly so that a wise decision can be made about how to proceed. Discussing OeD Symptoms Your therapist will spend most of this session and the next asking questions about topics that are very important to making decisions about what symptoms to treat and how to design the therapy. These topics include your obsessions, your compulsions, and any situations that you avoid entering because of your obsessive fears. For example, the therapist will ask what circumstances cause you to feel the need to do your rituals and ask you for recent examples. It is important to know whether you have mental rituals like praying, making lists in your mind, or thinking good thoughts to fix bad ones. It is also important to learn whether you ask questions or seek reassurance from other people or from experts. These are like rituals and require special intervention during therapy. The therapist will also ask what you think would happen if you didn\\'t do your rituals, for example, disease, death, fire, killing someone, going crazy, going to jail, and so forth. Finally, you\\'ll be asked about what kinds of situations or activities you avoid because of your OCD symptoms. This will take some thought since you are more likely to notice what you do rather than what you don\\'t do. The therapist will also ask you about the history of your OCD, when it first began and whether the symptoms have fluctuated or changed between then and now. Your ideas about why they began and persisted are also important. You\\'ll be asked how much time you spend on the OCD problems and how much they interfere with your ability to function, as well as whether other family members have had OCD or similar problems. Some people have other problems besides OCD, such as other anxiety conditions like the tendency to worry a lot, social fears or panic attacks, or other types of problems like eating disorders, problems with tics or impulsive behaviors, or problems with depression, alcohol or drugs, and so forth. Please be honest about these, since the therapist may have to adjust treatment to take these problems into account. The therapist will want to know what other treatments you have tried for OCD, especially medications and whether you are taking any now and what effect they have had. It is not necessary to take medications to benefit from the treatment described in this manual. However, your therapist will advise you whether the addition of medications might be helpful in your particular case. If you are already taking medications, therapists generally prefer that you keep these stable during the behavioral and cognitive treatment so that it is clear what effect the psychological treatment is having. If you were to change your medications substantially during therapy, it would be difficult to figure out whether you were getting better because of the psychological treatment or the medication. 12 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Asking Questions Feel free to ask questions about your therapist\\'s impression of your symptoms and whether they will respond to treatment. The vast majority of people with OCD can be treated with the methods that you will learn in this manual, but if you have concerns, it\\'s important to raise these and ask for information so you can be sure this is the right treatment for you at this time. If you are living with your family, your therapist may also ask you to think about the possibility of inviting the family member(s) to attend some or all of the next session or two. Often family members can be very helpful in giving information you might not have thought about, and they may have a different perspective on your situation that the therapist may find important to understand. Homework Your therapist will probably ask you to fill out some questionnaires or forms that inquire about your OeD symptoms and other symptoms as well. Please be honest in your answers, but you do not need to be careful to get the \"right\" answer. Try hard not to be perfectionistic about completing these. Your first impressions are more important. You might also be asked at the end of this session or the next one to keep a record of your main obsessions and compulsions for several days. This helps the therapist understand when these symptoms occur and exactly what it feels like to you. To do this, you will learn to rate your discomfort level on a scale from 0 to 100 where 0 means very relaxed or no discomfort at all and 100 is the worst anxiety or discomfort you have ever felt in your life. We call this scale Subjective Units of Discomfort or SUDs. A form for keeping a record is included on the next page. Getting Started 13 Self-Monitoring Form Please record the actual number of minutes or number of times you perform rituals specified on this form. Please note the situation that led to your need to\\' do the ritual, as well as the amount of discomfort on a scale from 0 to tOO, where 0 means completely calm and 100 means extremely upset or disturbed. Please note the following suggestions from your therapist for keeping records of rituals: Example: Ritual A: Washil1g Ritual B: CheckinS for harm Time of Day Situation that led to ritual Discomfort Minutes Ritualizing Ritual A Ritual B 9:30 a.m Took out the garbage 70 4 min. 11:30 a.m. Bathroom-urination 80 5 min. 1:00 p.m. Drove car to town center 85 10 min. 4:00 p.m. Used iron 60 2 min. 6:30 p.m. Cleaning up after dinner55 15 min. stove, oven, faucet Continued on Next Page 14 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsesslve-Compulsive Disorder  - -  - Self-Monitoring Form cont.

If you have any questions or comments, always feel free to voice these at the beginning of the time. General History Most of this session will be devoted to learning about your general history, including what it was like to grow up in your family, your social life as a child and an adult, your religious background, how you did in school, your past and present work situation, and your current family life. If you had any especially traumatic experiences, it is important to report these so the therapist understands what effect these might have had on you. These questions are designed to help the therapist understand your upbringing and experiences and how these might have influenced your OCD symptoms and affected your attitudes about various situations. You will also be asked about how your family has reacted to your OCD symptoms and about their views on why this problem developed. In particular, the therapist needs to know how your family accommodates to or is involved in your symptoms and how they feel about this. It is also important to learn how supportive your family members are and whether you get along so that they might be helpful during the treatment process. Symptom Severity After getting your history, the therapist will want to review your OCD symptoms in detail, especially to learn about any symptoms that didn\\'t corne up during the first session. You and your therapist will need to decide which symptoms should be the targets of the treatment and agree on the order in which they should be treated, if you have more than one obsession or compulsion. The therapist will look over your self-monitoring forms to understand how these symptoms occur on a daily basis, especially how much time they take and what triggers them. Sometimes, people have difficulty figuring out how to use these forms for record keeping. If this was true for you, your therapist will probably give new instructions that should work better for you. Your therapist may also ask questions to get a clear picture of the severity of the OeD problem. Homework Your therapist may ask you to complete other forms during the week and especially to begin to make a complete list of most obsessive situations that trigger rituals. This will form the basis for the treatment plan in which you will be gradually exposed to your feared situations. In the next session, the items on the list can be arranged according to how difficult they are for you. For now, just make as complete a list as possible, usually with fifteen to twenty-five situations that provoke obsessive fears. A blank list is given at the end of this session to help you. If you have more than one type of obsessive fear, you can make out another list of obsessive situations for each one. Often, the therapist will want to arrange a family session for the next visit to discuss family involvement in symptoms, reactions to OCD, and to educate family members about OCD and the behavioral and cognitive treatment methods that will be used with you. Generally, only adult family members living at home or in regular contact with you will be invited to attend, although you should tell the therapist if you want someone in particular to attend. 18 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder List of Obsessive Situations Obsessive Theme _ -Triggers for Obsessions Discomfort (specific situations, objects, or thoughts (0-100) that provoke obsessive fears) 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12. 13. 14. 15. Completing the Assessment 19  Family Assessment, Education, and Treatment Planning Family Assessment You and your family members will be interviewed together during this session, so that your family has a chance to describe what they have noticed about your symptoms. If your parents are attending, they might be asked about when the symptoms began and why they thought this happened at that time. They may also be able to comment on any changes they have observed over time. The therapist will also want to know how they feel about these symptoms and whether they blame themselves, as many parents do. Your family members will also be asked whether they accommodate to the OCD and if so, how. For example, many family members provide reassurance, wait for the OCD sufferer who may be doing rituals, avoid going into situations that upset the sufferer, perform compulsions for the sufferer, and take over tasks that are difficult for them to do. Because these efforts often produce frustration, the therapist will ask about your family members\\' reactions to the accommodation. It is also useful to know how family members think about their relationship with you and how well you communicate with each other. Knowing family members\\' attitudes toward the treatment program can also be important, especially if it might be helpful to include them in the treatment. If you find that family members are not very supportive, they probably won\\'t be included much in the treatment process, but it is still important for them to learn about the treatment so that they know what is happening and do not interfere mistakenly with the treatment process. Behavioral Models for OeD An important part of this session is educating you and your family members about the relationship of obsessions to compulsions and how the behavioral treatment works in relation to this. The following description helps clarify this. Treatments for OCD derive from observations that many people have made about the function that obsessions and compulsions serve. That is, obsessions provoke anxiety and other negative emotions like guilt. In contrast to obsessions, compulsions or rituals (these are different names for the same thing) reduce discomfort, even if only briefly. So obsessive thinking causes discomfort, and compulsive behaviors and mental rituals reduce it. Some obsessions begin when a traumatic experience or frightening information triggers strong fear in a person and then becomes associated with other reminders of this unpleasant experience. The fearful person begins to anticipate and avoid any reminders of the negative experience. Think about whether this is true in your own experience. If it is, your reaction may be a bit like thinking that you are about to be attacked by a ferocious animal without really knowing when or even whether the animal is on the loose or locked up. You become concerned whenever anything hints of the animal\\'s presence, and your tension helps you to be ready to protect yourself. A lot of uncertainty is involved, and when it is difficult to predict harm, people usually try very hard to control it. Perhaps your own rituals are an effort to control what seems like unpredictable fear reactions. Even very irrational fears can become quite persistent in this way. They become habits that occur automatically. Once a fear or obsession is established, people naturally try to reduce their discomfort. For many people, an effective method is simply to avoid the fearful situation in the first place or to escape from it. But when the fear is caused by internal thoughts or images rather than actual situations, it is impossible to avoid or escape because you can\\'t just turn off your thinking, although lots of people try. So people with obsessive thoughts develop more active ways to undo or prevent the fear by engaging in compulsive behaviors or mental rituals. But why would somebody keep doing these rituals when they are so time consuming and upsetting? This is because the rituals at least reduce discomfort a little or for brief periods, and even a brief reduction of bad feelings makes a person feel slightly better. It also strongly increases the chances that they will repeat whatever made them feel better. Figure 3-1 shows a model for how this works. Figure 3-1: Behavioral Model for OeD 1 Neutral Event Traumatic Event Media Information Vicarious Experience Anxiety Increase Rituals, Avoidance .\\'j Negative Reinforcement: (strengthens rituals and /) obsessions)Anxiety Decrease 22 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder This is how people get caught in a vicious circle that doesn\\'t seem to make a lot of sense unless you think about it carefully. The problem is that once people get hooked on compulsions to manage their obsessive discomfort, they never come into contact with their obsessive ideas or feared situations for long enough to get used to them. A good treatment for OCD, then, is exposure to feared situations and prevention of the rituals and avoidance that blocks this exposure. If people with OCD experience the things they fear for long enough, eventually they just get used to it. We call this \"habituation\" or \"extinction\" of emotional reactions. This is a lot like the experience we have when we first come into a room with a peculiar smell. After a while, we don\\'t notice the smell; we just get used to it. Likewise, someone who lives near train tracks stops noticing when a train goes by, even though the sound is quite loud. If compulsions or rituals interrupt the exposure, the anxiety reduction is also interrupted and discomfort stays high. So to be effective, exposure should not be interrupted with rituals, and these have to be stopped during exposures. To enable OCD sufferers to participate in treatment, you and your therapist begin with obsessions and situations that are less disturbing and work your way up to harder ones. This is why you need to develop a complete list of obsessive situations that can be arranged hierarchically from less to more discomfort. During therapy sessions, you\\'ll actually go to those situations for exposure and also do this as homework. Sometimes, it is also helpful to use imagined exposures for certain types of symptoms that are hard to work on directly. For each exposure situation, you and your therapist will work on blocking all avoidance and rituals so that the exposure is prolonged enough to reduce discomfort. You\\'ll be allowed to do some rituals in other situations that you haven\\'t yet started working on. Eventually, you work your way through all of the obsessive situations and block all of the rituals. If you have any questions about this explanation for behavioral treatment ask your therapist. Much has been written about OCD as a biological problem. Research findings show that people with OCD do have biological features that are different from those without OCD. These include differences in the structure of the brain and in brain biochemistry. It is important that you understand that both serotonergic medications and behavioral treatments produce changes in the brain that cause OCD sufferers\\' brains to look more like those who don\\'t have OCD. That means that there are several ways to correct OCD. One important advantage of behavioral treatment is that you will also learn skills that are useful in preventing a recurrence of obsessions and compulsions in the future. If you would like more information about biological features of OCD, you might want to read some chapters in the books on the reading list at the end of this manual, especially in the book by Jenike and colleagues (1998.) Cognitive Models for OCD People with OCD also seem to have certain kinds of mistaken interpretations about their obsessions and unhelpful attitudes that they\\'ve developed from experience. These types of thoughts might distort their view of some situations. For example, some people think that just having certain kinds of thoughts is bad and that they need to control those thoughts by not thinking them. The problem is that none of us can really control our thoughts in that way. In fact, researchers have demonstrated that trying to suppress obsessions actually strengthens them rather than reducing them. This Family Assessment, Education, and Treatment Planning 23 happens because when people work hard not to think something, they become so vigilant about these unwanted thoughts that they are even more attuned to them than if they\\'d left them alone in the first place. People with OCD also seem to overestimate the threat in various situations, when the real dangers are actually much lower. Because of this, they don\\'t tolerate uncertainty well and often have to check over and over to make sure they haven\\'t made important mistakes. Many people with OCD accept too much responsibility for situations and this leads to guilty feelings and rituals to undo the feared harm. Some people hold perfectionistic or rigid attitudes, perhaps because they were taught that it was important to \"do it right.\" Often, however, it would be much better to accept some mistakes and get the job done. These kinds of general errors in thinking or beliefs usually can contribute greatly to obsessive thinking and lead to longer and more elaborate behavioral and mental compulsions. Figure 3-2 shows a model for how cognitive features of OCD contribute to the problem of obsessions and rituals. The process begins with normal thoughts or images that approximately 90 percent of ordinary people have from time to time. A list of the kinds of thoughts people often have was given in the introduction to this manual. See if any of them are similar to your own obsessions. People interpret these intrusive thoughts to have a particular meaning. Interpretations are influenced by a person\\'s mood and by other events that cause stress. Sometimes people interpret intrusions differently when they have heard or read something recently in the news; that is, information can affect what you think about an intrusive thought. When an interpretation is especially anxiety or guilt provoking, most people try to reduce their discomfort with avoidance or rituals, which only work temporarily. Figure 3-2: Model of Cognition in OeD Intrusion (obsession) Beliefs Other Factors (general or specific) . ..( family history, stress, \"\"\\'biology, information) \\'\" Interpretations (expectancies, judgments, \"\\'automatic thoughts) \"\"\\'-Moodstate (depression, anxiety) / Neutral Emotions Negative Emotions (anxiety, guilt, depression) No further action Avoidance Compulsions 24 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder To correct some of the mistaken thinking that people with OeD might have, your therapist may use cognitive therapy techniques during the exposure treatment. Several techniques can help correct thinking errors and help speed up the recovery process. Still, it is easier to change behaviors like compulsions than it is to change the way people think. This takes longer but may be an important part of the therapy process. The treatment described in this manual begins with exposure and response prevention based on the behavioral model and gradually incorporates cognitive strategies based on the cognitive model. If you have any questions about the cognitive or exposure parts of the treatment, be sure to ask your therapist. What your therapist will be trying to do in treatment is to make obsessive thoughts much less disturbing and help you to stop avoiding them or stop using rituals or any other undoing strategy to get rid of them. He or she will also help you to think differently in reaction to intrusive thoughts, so that they stay with you a short whilel bother you only a littlel and then gradually go away. EventuallYI your obsessive thoughts will also become less frequent because they donlt bother you much and donlt produce the same intense urge to get rid of them. Insteadl you just live with them for a bit until they go away. Family Assistance with the Therapy Inviting a family member to assist in treatment depends on whether you would find the assistance helpful. If you wishl discuss this with your therapist so you can work out a plan for the treatment sessions and for homework that will be feasible for both you and your relative. The therapist will also need to talk to your relative about how to assist in treatment. UsuallYI this mainly involves attending sessions occasionally so everyone has the same understanding of the treatment plan. Sometimes relatives will be asked to help with exposure homework assignments at home or in other settings. Alsol your therapist will need to advise your relative how to respond in certain kinds of situations that can be confusing. Homework Your therapist will ask to see your list of obsessive situations and may request that you work on finalizing this list for next time. Your hierarchy is likely to be a main focus of the next session. Family Assessment, Education, and Treatment Planning 25  Exposure and Response Prevention Agenda For this session you will need to decide whether you are ready to proceed with exposure treatment. This will include revising your hierarchy list and beginning the actual exposure, starting with the first item(s) on your list. Goals for this session will likely be to reduce your obsessive fears during exposure, to think about how to begin returning to more normal patterns of living, and to identify more appropriate ways to cope effectively with daily stressors. It is important for you to learn to become an expert in your own treatment, and therefore, the therapist will help you learn how to do the exposures and how to interrupt or prevent rituals when you have an urge to do these. Exposure treatment requires much effort and courage. It might be helpful for you and your therapist to draw up a written therapy contract like the one at the end of this session so that you are both very clear about your responsibilities and activities during treatment. Developing the Hierarchy You have already begun to make a list of situations that provoke your obsessive fears and rituals. Now it\\'s time to review the list to be sure that it contains nearly all of the important obsessional situations that you are aware of. You may have more than one list because you have more than one type of obsessive fear. Examples of different hierarchy themes are contamination by pesticides, being dishonest, and causing harm by negligence. Don\\'t be concerned if you have several types of fears. This is not likely to impede your treatment since each obsession can be treated in tum. Items on your list should be organized according to the degree of discomfort they provoke on the 0 to 100 SUDs scale described earlier. Examples of hierarchies from patients with different types of OeD symptoms are given below to give you an idea of what to include and how to organize yours. Of course, your list(s) will be quite different from these, matching your particular fears. Fears of Dirt and Germ Contamination Item Discomfort Session Floor in therapist\\'s office 40 1 Waiting room chairs 45 2 Door knobs in office and waiting area 50 2 Hallway floor 55 3 Door knob outside the bathroom door 55 3 Shopping mall benches 55 3 Office bathroom sink, soap dispenser 60 4 Office bathroom floor, inside doorknob 65 5 Shopping mall floor 65 5 Office bathroom toilet seat 70-75 6 Shopping mall bathroom sink counter, knobs 75 6 Shopping mall bathroom toilet seat sanitary container 85 7 Using bathroom in shopping mall 90 8 Using bathroom in train or bus station 95 9 Fears of Harming Others [kids in another room] Sight of scissors on the table 30 1 Sight of paring knife on the counter 40 1 Sight of 6\" kitchen knife on the counter 45 2 Using paring knife to cut vegetables 50 2 Using kitchen knife to cut vegetables 55 3 Sight of large knife 55 3 Using large knife 60 4 28 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Item Discomfort Session [kids sitting at kitchen table] Using paring knife 70 5 Using kitchen knife 75 5 Using large knife 80 6 [kids at sink or counter] Using paring knife 85 7 Using kitchen knife 90 7 Using large knife 100 8 AIDS fears [at AIDS Action Center] Sitting in waiting area, handling literature 45 1 Using public rest rooms 50 1 [at Neighborhood Health Center] Sitting in waiting area for AIDS testing 50 2 Using public phones, doorknobs 55 2 Touching floors, trash can 65 3 Using public rest rooms 70 3 Going to restaurants and stores with probable gay 70 4 waiters/ salespeople Using public facilities at these restaurants/ stores 75 5 Sitting on benches in area frequented by possible drug 80 6 users [safe times/ places onlyJ [Hospital Emergency rooms] Sitting in waiting area 80 7 Using public rest rooms 90 7 Exposure and Response Prevention 29 Planning Exposures Sometimes the exposures to your obsessive fears can be done in or near your therapist\\'s office. For example, you might be able to bring many of your feared items into the office in a bag and then handle them while your therapist is present. Often, however, it will be necessary to do your exposures in your home, in your workplace, at shops or public places, or in other settings that you must travel to. It is often helpful to have your therapist go with you to these settings, especially the first time, but sometimes this may not be possible. Whatever your particular circumstance, planning the next several exposure sessions will require a careful review of the items on your hierarchy to determine how to implement the exposures and which ones should come first. Once you are confident that you can complete the exposure alone or with telephone assistance from your therapist, these situations can be assigned as homework. In any case, next to each hierarchy item should go the number of the session in which it will occur and the exact location of the exposure so that you and your therapist know what is planned for when. If you have more than one type of obsession and ritual, it is usually best to begin with one of them and make some progress on that one before moving on to the next type of situation. Remember that for each exposure situation, you will also need to stop doing any rituals that you would normally do in that context. This takes quite a lot of courage, but most people can do this with the therapist\\'s assistance. Beginning Exposure and Response Prevention To do the exposure to the first item on your hierarchy, you will need to make sure that full contact occurs. This means that if your fears are about contamination or things you don\\'t like to touch, you should touch it completely without protecting any area of your body, clothes, purse, or other thing you usually try to keep clean. Touch the item(s) with the palms of your hands and especially your fingertips, then touch your hands to your face and hair and aU parts of your c1othin~ handling things in your wallet or purse and so forth. Be sure not to avoid any part of the contact and don\\'t do any rituals, even small ones like wiping or brushing off the contamination. Even brief little rituals interfere with getting used to the item and prolong the whole process. Your therapist will try to help you do this as fully as possible. Your therapist will ask you about your discomfort level to see how you are reacting. Be sure to be honest in reporting this so that your therapist can make adjustments in the kind of exposure you do. It\\'s important to feel some significant discomfort in order to learn to have a different response to the obsessive situation. Sometimes you might react with strong fear or other emotions; your therapist will help you manage your discomfort while you keep doing the exposure. You will need to repeat the exposure or keep thinking about it to get the maximum benefit from the process. If you have checking rituals, you will probably be asked to do an activity without any checking and then keep the activity in mind. Depending on the nature of your symptoms, you may be advised to go on to other 30 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compufsive Disorder things or to keep ruminating about the first exposure without ritualizing. Your therapist will ask you about your emotional reaction every few minutes and will explore with you all aspects of your fears during the exposure. This means your thoughts, how you feel and how your body reacts, any catastrophic ideas that occur to you, memories, images, and so forth. This discussion helps you emotionally process your obsessive fears to the fullest extent. You should continue the exposure until you notice that some reduction in discomfort (called \"habituation\") occurs. Notice that when you stick it out, eventually you do feel better without any rituals or avoidance. If you run out of time before your discomfort decreases noticeably, your therapist might ask you to continue the exposure without rituals afterwards and to call in to report on the experience. Response-Prevention Plan It is very important to stop all rituals entirely during and after the exposure, including mental rituals, asking for reassurance or reassuring yourself in a compulsive way, and any other little compulsions you are tempted to do. By ritualizing you don\\'t learn that if you just left the obsessional fears alone, eventually you would feel better without the ritual. That is, you learn the wrong lesson, thereby undoing the work of the exposure session. If you encounter situations during the week that you have not yet worked on as part of the exposure, you may be allowed to do a brief ritual but then you must repeat the exposure from today\\'s session or from your homework. Otherwise, there is a significant danger that the ritual that you do in another context might undo some of the good exposure work you have already done. Generally, you and your therapist will use a gradual response-prevention plan with the following steps: Try to avoid exposure situations that are higher on your hierarchy whenever possible. Reduce all ritualizing to a minimum as agreed between you and your therapist. Stop all rituals and avoidance connected to current and previous exposure situations. Minimal rituals are allowed in difficult situations not yet encountered in treatment. Immediately following permissible rituals, re-expose yourself to the most recently practiced exposure items. The overall goal is to maximize exposure and minimize ritualizing, while still enabling you to tolerate discomfort and gain confidence in your ability to make positive steps. Exposure and Response Prevention 31 Homework You will need to do exposure homework every day or nearly every day until your next session. These assignments will usually include situations similar to ones you worked on during the session, but in other contexts to facilitate generalization to other settingsespecially ones you encounter frequently during the week. Sometimes, homework might also include other kinds of exposure situations because they provoke similar levels of discomfort as the ones in the treatment session. When you work on exposures by yourself, you might have a little more discomfort because a familiar and supportive person is not there. Often, a supportive family member is a good substitute. When your therapist assigns a homework task, be sure that you indicate whether you are confident that you can do it. If you are not, tell the therapist so both of you can figure out what assignment might be better. However, it is also important that you challenge yourself. You will not make good progress unless you are willing to try out exposures that are sometimes a bit difficult for you. Record your homework assignment on a Homework Form that is provided at the end of this chapter. This form asks for a description of the exposure context, how long you worked on it, and whether you were able to stop rituals. You will need to complete one of these forms daily, so please make copies or get copies from your therapist. Family Assistance If a family member will be assisting you, you and your therapist should decide whether to invite him or her to attend all or part of the exposure session and homework planning. This enables your relative to observe how your therapist behaves during the exposure process. Generally, your family assistant will be mainly an observer, helping you by asking occasional questions or making supportive or informational comments. Your relative\\'s role is to: Be available if possible when you need assistance or support during daily exposure homework Observe your progress during homework or other exposure situations Take note and report any observations that may be of interest to you and your therapist in planning treatment. This includes observation of avoidance and/or \"mini-rituals\" that you do that you might not have noticed. Your relative should not provide reassurance that might serve the same purpose as a ritual. You and your relative should agree on the procedure for contacting your therapist by phone if there is any confusion between sessions about homework assignments. 32 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Treatment Contract 1.

In addition, you will learn how to do imagined exposure or loop tape exposures if these are needed in your case. Be aware that not all oeD sufferers will need to use these procedures for exposure to be effective. Reviewing Homework First, your therapist will review the homework assigned from last session to make sure that this experience was helpfuL Some people may experience higher than expected anxiety during the homework. This means the exposure is activating obsessive fears, as it should. If you can tolerate the discomfort, anxiety eventually declines and you are likely to make good progress despite your discomfort. This takes more time for some people than for others. If you are having trouble completing your exposure homework or stopping your rituals as you had agreed, it is time for a discussion with your therapist about what is interfering with your progress. Remember that anytime you use rituals or avoidance to manage your anxiety during exposure homework, you are actually strengthening the OCD habits and mak- ing your own task more difficult. Exposure You and your therapist will select one or more items from your list for exposure for this session. You might notice some increase in discomfort compared to how you felt at the end of the last session. This is quite common. Usually anxiety rebounds a little between sessions and this is not a cause for concern. As before, observe your reactions carefully during the exposure process and report them to your therapist. Your therapist will ask you about your level of discomfort and help you engage fully in the exposure process. Try not to be tentative in doing the exposures, because this is a kind of avoidance designed to protect you. Instead you need to screw up your courage and take the plunge to see how you respond. If your family assistant is present, he or she might help you push yourself. As soon as you can tolerate the exposure reasonably well, check with your therapist about adding the next item on the hierarchy. Sometimes you\\'ll be able to include more than one hierarchy item in a single session, especially if both are conveniently accessible. However, you don\\'t need to push yourself too hard if your discomfort level is still high. Follow your therapist\\'s lead in the exposure, making sure that you do the exposure as completely as possible. Report your anxiety level when asked and focus on any obsessive ideas that occur to you. You can vary the exposure cues from time to time to encourage anxiety reduction in similar situations. Whenever you can, see if you can do the exposure yourself without help from your therapiSt. Between sessions, you\\'ll want to be able to do homework assignments without an assistant or to handle exposure situations that occur unexpectedly during the day. Sometimes during treatment, you will be asked to do things that most people do not ordinarily do unless they have to. Remember that most other people also don\\'t have OCD and that they could do the exposure if the situation required it. To really get over a fear, it is very important to confront your worst fears and to become comfortable with the worst part of the problem, not just the easier parts. Complete exposure now decreases the chances that your OCD symptoms will return later on, after therapy has ended. Imagined Exposure and Loop-Tape Methods For some types of obsessions and compulsions, it may be very useful to replace direct exposure with imagined exposures or loop-tape exposures, at least for some sessions. These methods are described here. In some cases, direct exposure to feared cues doesn\\'t provoke all of the OCD sufferers\\' fears of disasters. In other cases, direct exposures are very difficult to implement with your therapist present. For these situations, your therapist might suggest a procedure called imagined exposure which has the same kinds of effects that direct exposure does. First, you and your therapist construct a series of scenes that can be arranged, beginning with easier ones and progressing over the next several sessions to more difficult ones. These are tape recorded during the office session for replay as homework assignments. Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder 38 Together, you and your therapist outline a scenario in which you encounter the triggers for your obsessive discomfort. The scene usually includes one or more of your feared disastrous outcomes. Then, sit back in a comfortable chair with your eyes closed and listen to your therapist begin to describe the scene. Your therapist will ask you frequently for information about what you are seeing in the image using questions like: \"What do you see now? Describe what\\'s happening now. What do you hear [see, feel, smell, etc.]? What are you thinking? What is your reaction? How clear is the image on a scale from 0 to lOO? Tell me your discomfort level on a scale of 0 to 100.\" These questions enable the therapist to be sure that you are imagining the scene clearly and experiencing it fully. Be sure to be honest in your reporting, especially if you are having a problem forming the image clearly. During the scene, be sure that you do not imagine doing rituals or avoiding the triggers for your obsessive fears. The scene will be taped so you can play it back later as homework. Endless-Loop Tapes If you have obsessions that are mainly accompanied by mental rituals, it may be especially helpful to record your obsession in your own voice onto a loop tape that plays over and over. This permits repeated exposure to the obsession without interruption from the mental ritual. Examples of obsessions that lend themselves to this procedure are blasphemous, vulgar, or \"immoral\" thoughts, bad words, or unlucky numbers that pop into your mind. These obsessions usually provoke neutralizing or \"undoing\" self-statements, prayers, or other thinking rituals. You or your therapist can buy a loop tape of the right length to match the typical duration of your obsessive intrusion (for example, one-, two-, or three-minute tape). You and your therapist should first decide on the best wording for your obsessive thoughts and you can then narrate one or more of these thoughts aloud onto the tape. Then, listen to this tape during the therapy session and pay attention to the words and their meaning without inserting any mental rituals that you usually use. The therapist will also ask you to listen to this tape as a homework assignment for long enough to produce some reduction in discomfort. If you have several different kinds of disturbing intrusions, you and your therapist can arrange these in a hierarchy for exposure in the next several sessions. Family Assistance If your family member attends this session, he or she will learn the best ways to be helpful at home to encourage you in following the treatment. Your relative can call the therapist in case of any confusion between sessions. All of you should also discuss ways in which your family accommodates to your OeD symptoms and whether some changes in these accommodating behaviors may be appropriate at this point. A goal of the treatment is to reduce family accommodation and this can be accomplished gradually as you make progress on your exposures. Direct and Imagined Exposure and Response Prevention 39 Homework You and your therapist can agree on homework assignments that match the level of exposure difficulty at which you have been working. Homework might include direct exposure and/or imaged or loop-tape exposures. Usually imagined or looptape exposures are assigned daily or near daily for about an hour a day. In the case of loop tapes, this may be broken into shorter periods, and in the case of imagined scenes, more time might be needed to reduce discomfort. Your therapist will give you specific instructions for you and/ or your family member. Be sure to be alert for compulsive and avoidance behaviors so you can stop these during homework. 40 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Continuing Exposure and Response Prevention Agenda The agenda for this session includes reviewing your homework assignments, exposure to hierarchy items, and prevention of rituals, along with planning homework exposures and blocking compulsions, reassurance-seeking and avoidance, and discussion of family responses. Reviewing Homework You and your therapist will review homework from the previous session by examining the Homework Form and discussing any problems or difficulties. If you have any concerns, be sure to raise them at this time. Exposure, espedally without the help of your therapist, requires quite a lot of courage. Exposure You and your therapist should proceed as planned to the next items on the hierarchy. Take the lead in doing the exposure as much as you can, even if you feel somewhat reluctant. Focus on the exposure and on obsessive concerns you have. Let your therapist know what level of discomfort you experience and discuss any thought processes that accompany the exposures. Look for other situations for exposure that are similarly difficult to encourage generalization of the learning process to other contexts. If vour discomfort decreases fairly quickly to the hierarchy items, you can begin working on the next items. As ~lways, be active in yo~r contact with the exposure situation and focus on the expenence and on any assoClated thoughts, images, emotional responses, and perceptions. Your therapist will ask for a report of your discomfort level every few minutes to check on your progress. If you are able to continue the exposure after the session, this may help you make even more progress. Some people with fears of contamination feel the contact on their skin as a tingling sensation that transfers to other parts of their skin with direct touch and that may be especially difficult to tolerate because of the physical feelings. However, most physical sensations, even somewhat painful ones, lessen with time if you can just tolerate the discomfort for a while. You may find it helpful to experiment with what you notice about the exposure experience to see if you can decrease your sensitivity to the item. Sometimes, a person\\'s attention can help or hinder the exposure process. Sometimes what used to seem like minor OeD symptoms before you started treatment can become more prominent as you make progress on your hierarchy items. As anxiety reduces to the problem you are working on, old fears sometimes recur because now there is mental room to worry about these ideas again. This is a common experience for many OCD sufferers and is not a cause for alarm. It only means that you and your therapist need to develop another hierarchy and include exposures to the new fears. These are just as likely to habituate as the ones you\\'ve already worked on, often more rapidly than the original ones, and eventually you will \"run out\" of obsessions. Imagined and Loop-Tape Exposures If you have also been working on exposure to imagery scenes or to a loop-tape narration, you and your therapist can add new components to the scenes or tapes from the next step on your hierarchy. Generally, it is wise to avoid beginning a new scene of greater difficulty unless you have enough time remaining in the session to enable you to become accustomed to the images. The format for taped exposures will be similar to the previous ones. Response Prevention Sometimes OeD sufferers have difficulty distinguishing between reasonable coping strategies during exposure and ritualistic ones that should be prevented. Most of the time, if you just ask yourself whether it \"feels like a ritual,\" you\\'ll be able to tell whether your responses to the obsessive anxiety should be continued or blocked. Rituals have a driven quality to them so the person needs to repeat the effort or do it correctly in a particular and often stereotypic fashion. In contrast, coping responses simply help a person feel a little more comfortable by thinking in a more rational way. If you notice that you have begun to develop a new ritual, don\\'t be alarmed, but be sure to discuss this with your therapist so you can figure out how to block it effectively. Likewise, be observant of your need to obtain reassurance, since this often serves the same purpose as a ritual. Reassurance reduces discomfort but does not assist you in finding your own way to calm yourself in the face of obsessions. Of course, you have every right to ask for information when you do not know the Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder 42 answer to a question. However, if you find that the answers do not satisfy you or that you want to ask the same question again to be sure you heard it right and to calm your anxiety, consider this to be a rituaL Similarly, you may be tempted sometimes to try to assign responsibility for a situation to your therapist or to a family member rather than making your own decision about possible harmful outcomes. Again, try to resist this urge and discuss the problem with your therapist. Family Assistance Some people have difficulties with family members and may need help learning how to problem-solve to resolve these. If problems in negotiating planned exposures and blocking avoidance and rituals arise between you and your relative(s), you and you therapist may wish to consider a process called behavioral contracting. This usually involves an exchange of agreements in which each of you expresses a goal and agrees on how it should be implemented. First, your therapist helps you and your relative(s) focus on and define a problem. Then, each of you alternates making suggestions of possible ways to correct the problem. After some discussion of the possible advantages and disadvantages of the suggestions, your therapist will encourage agreement on a homework contract that specifies who will do what and when. Your family may need to rehearse how each of you will respond; for example, how your relative would remind you or what to say when expectations are met or not met. Depending on the outcome of the family contract between sessions, your therapist may need to help you renegotiate the plan. Homework You and your therapist need to agree on the daily homework for this week, depending on progress during today\\'s session. Try to select several items in different settings to promote generalization of your gains to as many other situations as possible. Consider in advance whether you think you might have difficulty resisting rituals or avoidance behaviors and discuss these concerns with your therapist to work out a plan. ContInuing Exposure and Response Prevention 43  Exposure and Beginning Cognitive Therapy Agenda The agenda for this session includes review of your homework and continued exposure to items on the hierarchy. Your therapist may also include cognitive therapy during exposure if this seems reasonable at this time. Homework Review As always, it is important to review your exposure homework to be sure that adequate time was spent on exposure and you were able to control your rituals. If you are having any problems with homework, be sure to discuss these so that you and your therapist can decide what to do. Also, if you are having any problems with family communication about OeD symptoms, discuss this with your therapist. Exposure and Ritual Prevention The session will begin with exposure to the previous and/or next item on your hierarchy, depending on your homework experience and whether you are becoming more comfortable with obsessive situations worked on so far. At this point you are probably able to practice exposure by yourself fully without being told what to do. H you haven\\'t already done so, it is important that you begin to practice exposure without your therapist having to direct you as much as before. Be sure that you fully attend to the fear cues by thinking about your thoughts and emotions during the exposure. Notice your discomfort level and report this to your therapist, along with how strongly you feel the urge to do a ritual. H your anxiety reduces quickly, it might be wise to move to another similar situation to be sure that you get used to different situations of the same type. This ensures that you learn to adapt to a variety of feared situations besides the first one you try. If you have been working on imagined exposure scenes or loop tapes of your obsessive thoughts, proceed as before and increase the level of difficulty of the scene or tape to match your progress so far. Cognitive Therapy You and your therapist have probably already talked about some of your interpretations about the meaning of your obsessive thoughts when these actually occur and some of the assumptions or beliefs that you have about your feared ideas. Your therapist will probably write these down from time to time, and will discuss them with you. You might want to pay attention to statements that you make that use words like \"always,\" \"never,\" and \"constantly.\" These words usually signal some exaggeration of reality, since very few situations can be accurately described in these kinds of absolute terms. Some examples of OCD sufferers\\' interpretations of intrusions and of beliefs are listed below to help you notice your own thoughts of this type. Interpretations of Intrusions Whenever I have these thoughts, I feel like I\\'m losing controL I\\'m afraid that the fact that I have this thought means I\\'m going to act on it. The more I think about these things, the greater the risk they will come true. If I ignored these thoughts and something really happened, I couldn\\'t stop blaming myself. Beliefs/Assumptions I believe I could really hurt someone. Ordinary people don\\'t get the kind of weird thoughts I do. You never know when you\\'re going to regret something. I just think I shouldn\\'t take the risk. If I don\\'t fix the problem when I see it, somebody will get hurt. In a way, I\\'m responsible just because I knew about it. I just can\\'t stand it when I don\\'t know the answer. My father was right-when you can\\'t do it right, you shouldn\\'t do it at all. This is a good time to look back at the introduction and session 3, where the cognitive model of OCD was explained. This model presumes that your obsessions have become a problem, at least in part because of how you interpret the intrusive obsessions when they occur. Instead of just being surprising but not especially alarming ideas, they\\'ve become fearful ones. Remember to think of how the 46 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder thoughts affect your emotions and also your behaviors. At the end of this session, we\\'ve drawn a diagram called the Cognitive Triangle to show the influence of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors on each other. Discuss with your therapist how this applies specifically to your intrusive thoughts that contribute to your obsessions and compulsions. By now, the interpretations that are linked to your obsessions have become thinking habits that are so routine you have probably stopped questioning them. You probably also have some basic assumptions and beliefs that are also so automatic that you are hardly aware of them; usually you\\'ve often grown up thinking these ideas were correct. Your therapist will help you figure out what these intrusions and beliefs are so that you can examine them more closely to see whether they should be changed. Your therapist will help you do this by using what we call the scientific method. This means that you and your therapist will consider each idea carefully to see if there is good evidence to support your beliefs and interpretations or whether there are alternative ideas that might actually be more likely or have more supporting evidence. To use this method, your therapist will ask you questions about your thoughts and rephrase what you say to be sure you both understand clearly what you think and why you think it. This helps you explore the logic that you use to support or refute your beliefs. Often, this can be done very effectively during exposures because this is when the ideas associated with your obsessive thinking come to mind most readily. As you and your therapist discuss your ideas, be on the lookout for conclusions that you have drawn that seem illogical when you look at them closely, but yet you believe them when you have an intrusive thought. Your therapist will probably have some ideas for how to help you examine them closely and how to change them if you decide they really don\\'t make sense to you anymore. One strategy for helping you begin this process is to determine your worst case scenario for your obsessive ideas to see what your most basic fear is about. This can usually be identified through a process called downward arrow in which your therapist repeats questions like: \"50 if that happened, what would that mean?\" \"And if that happened, what would/ could happen next?\" \"If that occurred, why would that be so bad?\" Eventually, you reach a \"bottom line\" and can think of no worse consequence of this sequence of events. Examples of ultimate fears are being rejected by someone important to you, dying, being a bad mother, being responsible for someone\\'s death, going to hell, being humiliated or finding out you are stupid. To help you use this method, a Downward Arrow Form is included at the end. Two examples of the beliefs of OCD sufferers are given below: Example 1 I will write an incorrect bank account number, and the money will go to the wrong person. t I will never get my money back. t I will be responsible for the error and I will lose my legal right to get my money back. t I will live in poverty for the rest of my life. Exposure and Beginning Cognitive Therapy 47 Example 2 If I let my daughter\\'s friend come over to play, she might touch the woodwork in our old house. ~ She\\'ll eat the paint and get lead poisoning. ~ Her parents will blame me for letting her come near the paint. ~ I\\'ll be an irresponsible parent. ~ Other people will never let their children play with my daughter. My daughter will be rejected tciallY and it will be my fault. ~ I won\\'t be able to live with myself. It is also important to figure out what the main themes of your intrusive thoughts and beliefs are. These are likely to fall into several categories that seem to be common for people with OCD. These themes are overestimating threat, intolerance for ambiguity, overestimating the importance of your thoughts and your need to control them, accepting excessive responsibility for events, holding perfectionistic standards for your behavior, believing you cannot tolerate anxiety and won\\'t be able to cope with anxiety or other unexpected events. More than one of these beliefs may underlie your obsessive fears. These and other interpretations and beliefs that you hold will be the focus of cognitive therapy in the next few sessions. During exposure, be sure to pay attention to the feared stimulus as much as possible and to use your reactions to the exposure to help figure out your thinking. You may need to continue the exposure after the end of the session to be sure you have processed it fully from an emotional point of view. Homework You and your therapist should agree on exposure homework that will be consistent with what you did during session so that any reduction in your discomfort generalizes to other similar settings. You can pass on any special instructions to your family assistant. As always, be sure to prevent any avoidance and any rituals during your homework exposures. Your therapist will ask you to complete a Homework Form. You should also keep a record of any intrusive experiences and your interpretations and assumptions when obsessive fears arise during the week. You can do this during exposure homework and also when unexpected exposures provoke discomfort for you. Use the Thought-Record Form at the end of this chapter to keep this record. Record the situation that provoked the obsessive fear, thought, or image and any 48 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder thoughts that you noticed in connection with the obsession. To become more aware of your thinking, ask yourself questions like \"What am I thinking?\" or \"What am I worried about?\" and write down any ideas that pop into your head. The form also asks you to rate how strongly you believe in your interpretation and then what emotions you experienced, such as anxiety, guilt, anger, sadness, etc., and the strength of these emotional reactions. If you have any questions about how to fill out this form, be sure to discuss it with your therapist.

Exposure and Beginning Cognitive Therapy 53  Exposure and Cognitive Therapy (Logical Errors and Interpretations) Agenda The agenda for this session is identical to the last session with the addition of helping you identify errors in your thinking about obsessions and deliberately examining your interpretations of obsessive intrusions when they occur. Homework Review With your therapist, review how the exposure and blocking of rituals and avoidance went since last session. Your therapist may choose to wait to review your Thought-Record Forms assigned last week until after you have begun the exposure from your hierarchy planned for this session. Exposure and Ritual Prevention As in the last session, begin exposure to the next item on your hierarchy. Expose yourself as fully as possible and report your discomfort level to your therapist. Pay attention to the situation and to how you feel, but especially notice your thoughts when you are uncomfortable to see how you are interpreting the experience. Your therapist will ask you about these. Once you begin to feel that you can manage the exposure reasonably well, your therapist is likely to begin reviewing your Thought-Record Forms and help you with some cognitive interventions as described below. Cognitive Therapy If you were able to apply the downward arrow procedure from last session, it might be useful to apply it now to the exposure you are doing. If that doesn\\'t seem helpful, your therapist may ask you about your interpretations associated with an obsessive situation or event that happened since the last session. Remember that your therapist doesn\\'t know the answers to questions he or she may ask, and there are no right or wrong answers. It is important to examine how you think and what goes through your mind, even if it seems silly or unreasonable. Think of yourself as a scientist trying to study an interesting phenomenon and to report on your observations. If you had trouble completing the Thought Record Form, please discuss this with your therapist. Otherwise, look it over and try to formulate your interpretations as hypotheses. Hypotheses are \"If ... , then ...\" statements that specify what you think will happen under certain circumstances. For example, after looking at the thoughts you wrote down, you might record your hypothesis as: \"If I can\\'t remember this fact, that means I am a stupid person.\" Now you can examine whether you think that, in fact, your hypothesis is really true. To do this, you will need to decide whether you think it is true of you and also whether you think it is true of all people. You\\'ll also need to think whether it is true only in special situations or whether it is always true. If you think it is true of you, but not of other people, or true sometimes but not others, you will have to consider how these discrepancies could be explained. Think about what evidence you are using to draw your conclusion. In doing this, you are taking on the role of a scientist to examine your own thinking and the evidence that supports or refutes it. Identifying your interpretations and hypotheses is a skill that takes some practice to master. Once you have learned to do it, there are several ways to examine the evidence to help you decide which interpretations or beliefs are reasonable and which ones you think are mistaken. In this session you will learn to identify cognitive errors you might be making and to challenge your interpretations so you can examine the evidence for your hypotheses carefully. Cognitive Errors One way to challenge faulty interpretations is to see whether you are in the habit of thinking in certain sorts of irrational ways. At the end of this chapter, look over the List of Cognitive Errors to see whether any of these are occurring now in the way you are thinking about this exposure situation. For example, are you \"labeling\" yourself as stupid or engaging in \"fortune telling\" by blaming yourself already for something bad that hasn\\'t happened without considering the possibility of good outcomes? Sometimes it is helpful to challenge this type of thinking by asking yourself, \"What evidence do I have to base this prediction on?\" Catastrophizing and emotional reasoning are other common thinking errors. Another is black-and-white thinking, for example, \"If I do \\'X,\\' I\\'ll cause serious harm.\" One way to examine the accuracy of this kind of thinking is to try thinking in shades of gray or percentages: \"Exactly how big an opportunity will I miss compared to other opportunities?\" 56 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Challenging Interpretations You and your therapist will be looking for common themes that run through your assumptions and beliefs. Sometimes these can cause mistaken interpretations of obsessive intrusions. Your therapist will try to help you decide which beliefs and interpretations are the most problematic and find cognitive techniques that will be most helpfuL To work on this, it may be useful to select a few thoughts from your Thought Record and figure out what themes you can detect. Below is a list of possibilities that are fairly common for people with OCD. Some of these were mentioned in session 3. Overimportance of thoughts Need to control thoughts and lor actions Overestimating the probability or the severity of danger Overconcern about certainty or difficulty tolerating ambiguous situations Excessive responsibility Perfectionism and strict standards for your behavior Concern about the consequences of anxiety and/or your ability to cope it These beliefs often result in faulty interpretations of intrusive thoughts. For example, if you believed that it was important to control your thoughts, you would be more likely to be upset when an unwanted thought occurred because you would interpret this to mean that you were bad and were about to lose controL You and your therapist can begin to look more carefully at your interpretations to see if there are other ways to look at them or other assumptions that might be equally valid. The thought challenging techniques are useful tools to help you develop alternative hypotheses. You can try on or test these alternative explanations in specific exposures or experiments later on. Challenging your beliefs is not just an exercise; it does lead to real change in attitudes and behavior. If you have doubts about this, chances are that you have already had this experience in another type of context that you and your therapist might discuss. Consider the follOWing questions, which may help you challenge your interpretations and formulate rational alternatives: What is the evidence for and against my specific interpretation? Are my interpretations logical? Have I confused a thought with a fact? Are my interpretations of the situation realistic? Am I using black-and-white thinking? Am I confusing certainties with possibilities? Is my judgment based on the way I feel instead of facts? Have I emphasized the irrelevant factors? What would I tell a friend who told me this? (Logical Errors and Interpretations) 57 What would a friend say to me? What could I tell myself? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this type of thinking? Is this thought helpful right now? What would be a more rational way of looking at that? Homework You and your therapist should agree on your exposure homework until the next session. You can also plan to listen to taped imagined exposures if these are relevant. You may need to pass any special instructions on to your family assistant if you have one. Remember to anticipate and block avoidance and rituals. Also, your therapist will probably ask you to complete another version of the Thought Record (#2) which includes an additional column for you to write down how you challenged your thoughts and rate how credible were the rational alternatives that you used. 58 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder List of Cognitive Errors 1. All-or-Nothing Thinking: You see things in black-or-white categories. If a situation falls short of perfect, you see it as a total failure. 2. Overgeneralization: You see a single negative event, such as a romantic rejection or a career reversal, as a never-ending pattern of defeat by using words such as \"always\" or \"never\" when you think about it. 3. Mental Filter: You pick out a single negative detail and dwell on it exclusively, so that your vision of all of reality becomes darkened, like the drop of ink that discolors a beaker of water. Example: You receive many positive comments about your presentation to a group of associates at work, but one of them says something mildly critical. You obsess about his reaction for days and ignore all the positive feedback. 4. Discounting the Positive: You reject positive experiences by insisting they \"don\\'t count.\" If you do a good job, you may tell yourself that it wasn\\'t good enough or that anyone could have done as well. Discounting the positive takes the joy out of life and makes you feel inadequate and unrewarded. 5. Jumping to Conclusions: You interpret things negatively when there are no facts to support your conclusion. Variations on this theme are: Mind reading: Without checking it out, you arbitrarily conclude that someone is reacting negatively to you. Fortune telling: You predict that things will turn out badly, even when you don\\'t really know what will happen. 6. Magnification: You exaggerate the importance of your problems and shortcomings, or you minimize the importance of your desirable qualities. 7. Emotional Reasoning: You assume that your negative emotions necessarily reflect the way things really are: \"1 feel guilty. I must have done something wrong; I must be a bad person.\" Or \"1 feel anxious. Something terrible must be about to happen.\" 8. \"Should\" Statements: You tell yourself that things should be the way you hoped or expected them to be. \"Musts,\" \"oughts,\" and \"have to\\'s\" are similar offenders. \"Should\" statements that are directed against yourself lead to guilt and frustration. \"Should\" statements directed against other people or the world in general lead to anger and frustration. Continued on Next Page (Logical Errors and Interpretations) 59 List of Cognitive Errors cont. 9. Labeling: Labeling is an extreme form of all-or-nothing thinking. Instead of saying, \"I made a mistake/\" you attach a negative label to yourself: \"I\\'m a loser.\" You might also label yourself \"a fool\" or \"a failure\" or \"a jerk.\" Labeling is quite irrational because you are not the same as what you do. Human beings exist, but \"fools/\" \"losers/\" and \"jerks\" do not. These labels are just useless abstractions that lead to anger, anxiety, frustration, and low self-esteem. 10. Personalization and Blame: Personalization occurs when you hold yourself personally responsible for an event that isn/t entirely under your control. Personalization leads to guilt, shame, and feelings of inadequacy. For example, a woman who received a notice that her child was having difficulties at school told herself, \"This shows what a bad mother I am/\" instead of trying to pinpoint the cause of the problem so that she could be helpful to her child.

Homework Review You and your therapist can review the exposure Homework Form and discuss your progress and any difficulties. You will also want to review your Thought Records for this session, either before starting or after you have begun the exposure. Exposure and Blocking Rituals Proceed to the next item on your hierarchy list; expose yourself to the situation so that you can process the situation fully. As you work with more difficult items on your list, you may find that you need a little more help managing your anxiety and remaining in the situation. Your therapist will suggest ways to help if this is needed. Pay attention to your emotional reactions and the thoughts, ideas, or images that arise, as well as to your interpretations or beliefs. Cognitive Therapy Challenging the Importance of Thoughts Discuss the ways in which you tried to challenge your interpretations and beliefs on your Thought-Record Form. It is important to try to keep your scientific perspective as much as you can since it helps you examine your reactions more objectively. Be sure that you are focusing on your hypotheses about yourself and not just on the obsessive thoughts. This session contains several suggestions for ways to work on your interpretations, especially if they concern overimportance of thoughts. The main ideas related to overimportance of thoughts are that: Just having the thought means it is important. Thoughts can cause behaviors or events. Thinking is as bad as doing. Your therapist will help you decide which of the techniques suggested below are likely to be pertinent or useful in your situation. Examining the Logic If you think that \"If I have a thought, it must be important/\\' you and your therapist can discuss whether you think that all of your thoughts are important just because you think them. That is, are some of your thoughts unimportant? If you think that \"Thoughts can cause actions/\\' you and your therapist can try generating other examples of this besides your usual obsessive thought to see whether you believe this is true in situations besides your obsessive ones. Sometimes you may need to test your ideas by using a behavioral experiment during the coming week. If you think that \"Thinking is the same as doing/\\' consider again the fact that 85 to 90 percent of ordinary people have intrusive thoughts which may be similar to your own. These were listed in table 1 in the introduction. You and your therapist might want to examine the likelihood that you would act on your ideas, as well as the kind of evidence you would consider appropriate to determine whether someone who has these kind of thoughts would act on them. You may wish to discuss any learning experiences you have had that might contribute to your beliefs. Survey Method Sometimes it may be useful to take a different perspective for a while. For example, you might ask yourself whether you would hold the same attitude toward someone else you know welL You might also want to conduct a small survey among people you know to determine how different your thoughts are from a group of people without OCD. Continuum Technique If you think of yourself as \"bad\" or \"immoral\" because of obsessive thoughts, such as harming others or engaging in sexual acts, it may be useful to rate your own 64 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compuls;ve Disorder behavior in relation to other \"bad\" or \"immoral\" acts. Your therapist can help you examine your attitudes about yourself in the context of your beliefs about all immoral acts. For example, you could draw a line and write \"extremely immoral\" at one end and \"very moral\" at the other end. Decide what behavior belongs at each extreme, as well as in the middle. Rate \"thinking about (your thought)\" in comparison to other actions you listed. Advantages and Disadvantages Your therapist can also help you examine and list the pros and cons of your interpretations and beliefs so you can examine the value of the advantages compared to the disadvantages. Challenging the Need to Control Thoughts Many people with OCD try to manage their anxiety by trying to control their obsessive thoughts. If this is true for you, it may be useful to learn the effects of trying to stop your obsessive thoughts. Use the Thought Suppression Graph given at the end of this session to graph how often the obsessive thought occurs on days when you try to stop it compared to days when you allow it to appear freely without interference. It is usually best to alternate suppression days with no interference days to see the effect. Homework Agree on your exposure homework until the next session and plan to listen to taped imagined exposures, if these are relevant. Remember to anticipate and block avoidance and rituals. Continue completing the Thought-Record Form and note whenever you tried one of the methods you learned in this session or previous ones. After trying out the methods you are taught, select the ones you find most useful or comfortable and use these as often as it seems appropriate. (Overlmportance of Thoughts) 65 Thought Suppression Graph Number of intrusions Intrusive thought to suppress: 66 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulslve Disorder Exposure and Cognitive Therapy (Danger and Anxiety) Agenda The agenda for this session is similar to previous ones, with the addition of challenging interpretations and beliefs about overestimation of the probability or severity of danger and the consequences of experiencing anxiety. Homework Review You and your therapist should review the exposure homework, as well as your Thought Records to see how you are applying the cognitive-therapy skills you have learned so far. You and your therapist can also review the Thought Suppression Graph if you used this during the week. Exposure and Ritual Prevention For many OCD sufferers, exposure sessions will occur outside the office or may be assigned mainly as homework if the therapist cannot be present Remember to be in full contact with your next hierarchy item or situations. Observe your emotions, thoughts, and behaviors and take care not to allow any rituals or avoidance of this situation. Discuss with your therapist your catastrophic fears and any other emotional reactions and interpretations or beliefs that you experience. Cognitive Therapy Your therapist will want to know which cognitive skills you have found helpful since the last session and whether you noticed any cognitive errors and how you dealt with these. Several additional cognitive techniques are described below as possible options for you and your therapist to consider, depending on the nature of your obsessive symptoms and beliefs. Challenging Estimates of Harmful Outcomes If you are prone to overestimating danger, you may want to actually calculate the probability of the dangerous outcome. To do this, you will need to first determine what specific events would have to occur to lead to the outcome you fear, estimate actual likelihood of each event separately, and compute the overall chances of the feared harm by multiplying together all of the chances of each separate event. You can then compare your original estimate of the probability to the one you calculate after thinking it through carefully. Your therapist can work this through with you. The survey method that was described in session 9 may also be useful to determine the frequency or likelihood of your feared consequences. First make a prediction about the likelihood of the outcome you fear and then find out how many people actually experienced this event and what their attitude would be toward people who make this mistake. You may notice that you tend to estimate a greater likelihood of harm or danger when you\\'re anxious than when you are calm. Consider how you might use this information when you are confronted with your obsessive fears between sessions. Another method for examining the accuracy of your predictions about the probability of catastrophes is behavioral experiments. These are like scientific experiments to test the evidence for and against alternate interpretations. Your therapist will help you devise experiments that test your hypotheses, and you can record your experiences on the Cognitive-Behavioral Experiment Form at the end of this chapter. As a general rule, for all of your experiments you should first specify in writing the hypothesis you are testing (that is, the likelihood of occurrence of feared consequences) and also review that hypothesis after you\\'ve completed the experiment. Challenging Estimations of the Severity of the Consequences If your therapist agrees that it would be useful, you may wish to consult with an expert to determine whether the consequences of a feared outcome will be as severe as you expect. Be sure, however, that this is not just another way to obtain reassurance that is like doing a ritual. Also, consulting with an expert should not be a substitute for examining whether you are making important cognitive errors, like jumping to conclusions or black-and-white thinking. If you notice this, ask yourself whether this type of thinking is also appropriate for other contexts in which other types of disasters (not your obsessive ones) might occur. Your therapist can help 68 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder you do this. You may also need to ask yourself whether the fact that a disaster could occur and would be terrible makes it any more likely. Role playing or the courtroom technique may help you generate alternate hypotheses besides your catastrophic ones. You can test these by playing the role of a judge or jury member or acting as a lawyer in your own case. You will need to evaluate the rationality of the arguments you have been making from a new perspective in which only reasonable evidence is admissible in \"court.\" See session 11 for more detail about this method. Challenging Beliefs About the Consequences of Anxiety Some OCD sufferers believe that anxiety is dangerous or that it will render them unable to function. These types of beliefs can interfere with exposure because people who are afraid of experiencing discomfort often use rituals and avoidance to stop or control anxiety. This, in turn, prevents them from disconfirming these and other faulty beliefs and interpretations. Sufferers with these fears may worry about the immediate effects of anxiety, for example, going crazy or losing control of your senses. If you have these types of beliefs, your therapist can help you use the downward arrow technique to identify your fears and associated beliefs. You and your therapist can then review whether you ever felt anxious in the way you\\'ve reared in the past and what happened when you did. Consider whether you have ever lost control or behaved strangely if you fear these outcomes. Some people with OCD believe that anxiety will prevent them from functioning. If this is a problem for you, consider whether you have been anxious in the past but still functioned, even if you weren\\'t at your best. If this is true for you, you will need to reevaluate the accuracy of your belief that functioning with anxiety is impossible. If you are afraid of anxiety in the future, your therapist can help you explore whether trying to avoid anxiety by using rituals and avoidance is actually likely to reduce your obsessive fear. As you think about what has happened on previous occasions when you tried to avoid anxiety, you and your therapist can examine the advantages and disadvantages of continuing your OeD behavior. Behavioral experiments can also be used to chal1enge overestimates of the negative consequences of anxiety. You and your therapist can write down your predictions about your behavior while you are anxious in certain situations and then agree on an assignment to test this prediction by obserVing your actual performance while you are anxious. Then you can compare your prediction to your actual performance and develop a hypothesis to explain what happened. Homework Your exposure homework will be similar to last session\\'s, but with new items that are next on your hierarchy. You can also follow cognitive therapy homework assignments that you and your therapist agree on by using the techniques you have learned so far. These include using the downward arrow to identify your worst fears and basic beliefs, examining the evidence from a scientific or courtroom per( Danger and Anxiety) 69 spective, generating alternative hypotheses, conducting surveys, evaluating your own behavior on the entire continuum of problem behaviors that you obsess about, calculating the probability of danger and challenging your estimations of consequences of anxiety, and examining the advantages and disadvantages. Finally, you and your therapist can agree on which behavioral experiments should be carried out. 70 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Cognitive-Behavioral Experiment Form Session # Name Date _ 1.

(Danger and Anxiety) 71  Exposure and Cognitive Therapy (Responsibility) Agenda The agenda for this session is similar to previous ones, with the addition of cognitive techniques for challenging interpretations and beliefs about responsibility for thoughts and actions and the consequences of responsibility. Exposure and cognitive homework will be assigned. Homework Review You and your therapist should review the exposure homework, as well as your Thought Records to see how you are applying the cognitive therapy skills you have learned so far. You and your therapist can also review the Cognitive-Behavioral Experiment Form if you used it during the week. Exposure and Ritual Prevention Exposure should continue as before, scheduling sessions in or outside the office as needed or as homework if the therapist cannot be present. By now you should be working on the highest items on the hierarchy and it is very important to be in full contact with these hierarchy situations. Observe your emotions, thoughts, and behaviors and do not allow any rituals or avoidance of the situations you are working on. Discuss with your therapist your catastrophic fears and any other emotional reactions and interpretations or beliefs that you experience. Continue the exposures until your discomfort reduces noticeably. Cognitive Therapy This session includes some additional methods for working on problems you might have with overestimating your responsibility for your thoughts and actions. As for the previous sessions, some of these problems and ways of resolving them will not fit for you. You and your therapist can pick and choose what seems to be most relevant and likely to have the most benefit for you. Challenging Responsibility Some OCD sufferers believe that they are responsible for having an obsessive thought that makes them uncomfortable (for example, thoughts about stabbing someone or blasphemous thoughts) or that they are responsible for doing or not doing something (for example, not picking up objects in the road to prevent someone from having an accident or failing to check something). People who have these kinds of obsessive fears often feel guilty and fear that others will reject them if they find out that they have been \"irresponsible\" in these ways. If you experience obsessive fears like these and tend to believe that it is your responsibility to control your thoughts and actions, the treatment methods suggested below may be of help. Consult with your therapist about how best to use these methods. Pie Technique One way to work on changing your beliefs about responsibility is to use the pie technique. First, estimate what percentage of responsibility you believe you have for what you are afraid will happen. Then, with your therapist\\'s help make a written list of all of the other factors that could possibly playa role. Often there are some that you have not thought of because you are so focused on your own role in the potential problem. Your therapist can help you think about this and a supportive family member might also be helpful. Then, draw all of these portions of responsibility as pieces of a pie. Label all of the pieces and make them larger or smaller depending on the amount of responsibility they should have for the outcome you are concerned about. Draw your own contribution last. After you are finished, see how your original estimate of your responsibility compares to the one after you have finished the pie. Courtroom Approach You can also use the courtroom technique described in session 10 to challenge your interpretations of responsibility. You and your therapist can decide which roles to play first\" but eventually, you must attempt to defend your guilt using only empirical evidence that would be allowed in a court of law. This means that emotional reasoning in which you are accused of being guilty simply because you feel that way would not be considered acceptable evidence unless you can generate factual proof. Your therapist will help remind you when evidence would be inadmissible. You may need to use this method several times for various obsessive fears before you are able to use it to challenge your irrational interpretations when you are alone. 74 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Double-5tandard Technique Many OCD sufferers hold one standard of responsibility for themselves but another for other people. Often their expectation of blame from others is much greater than their own blame of someone else who might contribute to or cause the same problem. If this double standard applies to you, your therapist can help you evaluate what you actually believe and why. You might also want to consider the advantages and disadvantages (or costs and benefits) of maintaining a double standard. Behavioral Experiments Experiments can also help you correct beliefs about being overly responsible. As usual, you can write out your hypotheses and predictions first and after doing the experiment, you can examine whether your predictions came true and whether there are any alternative hypotheses. Your therapist will help you design experiments if this method seems useful for you. Homework Your exposure homework should follow what you worked on in this session or since the last assignment. Consider whether you will need any family assistance or discussion, and how you will prevent rituals and avoidance. Complete the Thought Record during planned or unexpected exposure situations, and apply relevant cognitive techniques taught so far, after discussing your preferences with your therapist. These techniques include the ones learned in previous sessions, as well as those described for this session to resolve problems with excessive responSibility. These include the pie technique, courtroom approach, double-standard examination, and possibly behavioral experiments. At the next session let your therapist know which methods you used and which ones worked best. (Responsibility) 75  Exposure and Cognitive Therapy (Certainty and Perfectionism) Agenda The agenda for this session is similar to previous ones, with the addition of cognitive techniques for challenging interpretations and beliefs about the need for certainty and perfectionism. Exposure and cognitive homework will be assigned. Homework Review You and your therapist should review the exposure homework, as well as your Thought Records and the Cognitive-Behavioral Experiment Form, if applicable, to see how you are applying the cognitive therapy skills you have learned so far. Exposure and Ritual Prevention At this point, you should have been exposed to the highest items on your hierarchy. From this point on, you will need to continue exposures to items that are still difficult and provoke the most discomfort. You and your therapist should review the original hierarchy so you can give new discomfort ratings to each item to determine what exposures are still needed. Some or all of these may need to occur outside the office and as homework assignments, as in previous sessions. Try to work in a variety of different exposure contexts to encourage generalization of your gains to multiple settings. Your therapist will want you to take the primary lead in planning the exposures if you have not already begun to do this, so that you are prepared to handle future situations when obsessions or compulsive urges occur when you are not in treatment. You and your therapist can also review the Thought Records and discuss the techniques that were most helpful. Cognitive Therapy Challenging the Need for Certainty and Perfectionism Some OCD sufferers have problems with a need for certainty and difficulty tolerating ambiguous situations. If you think this is a problem for you, sometimes the downward arrow method can help clarify exactly what you fear most, if this is not already apparent to you and your therapist. In using this method of specifying each part of the ear, notice whether you are making any cOgnitive errors. Common ones are black-and-white thinking and jumping to conclusions, but you may also have others. Consider whether these thoughts are reasonable in the context you have outlined. Another useful method already described is examining the advantages and disadvantages of being certain or being perfect and meeting high standards. As you do this, consider the value of the advantages and also examine the disadvantages of being certain or perfect. Usually, these are substantial and may be what brought you into treatment. The survey method also may be helpful in challenging the need for certainty or meeting perfectionistic standards. Consider conducting a survey of a small group of people about their own standards and certainty in various situations that you and your therapist think would be good tests. It is best to fitst predict how you think the survey will tum out and then compare your predictions to the actual results. The continuum technique was used previously for overirnportance of thoughts and may be helpful here. On paper you can create a scale from least to most important with regard to certainty and perfectionistic standards and decide what to put at each end as a good description of the ends of your scale. Your therapist can help you decide what goes there. Then, think where on this scale you would put different examples of situations on the continuum you are working on. After this, rate the most recent situation when you were concerned about certainty or standards and see how it compares with your attitude at the time of that obsessive concern. For example, you might create the following scale: not important to very important to remembertbe rememberlbe certain certain Consider where an item like remembering who pitched for the Yankees in 1950 would fit on this scale. What about remembering your children\\'s birthdates? Now, rate your most recent intrusive thought about forgetting or uncertainty. Where does it fall on the scale? Often, it is also helpful to enumerate all of the things (not just obsessive ones) that you aren\\'t certain about and examine the need to know these things as well. You could also design a behavioral experiment to challenge the importance of certainty and whether failing to know something or meet a certain standard means that something bad will happen. For example, you might decide to test how you 78 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsesslve-Compulsive Disorder experience doing something mostly right, but not perfectly, like leaving some dishes undone or completing most but not all parts of a task. Work out the details of this experiment with your therapist. Homework For homework, plan to do exposure and response prevention to cover the remaining items or situations that still provoke discomfort. You should decide how to conduct these exposures and prevent avoidance by yourself, only asking for help if you feel confused about how to proceed. Plan to complete the Thought-Record Forms and to apply the cognitive techniques you have found useful. If it is a problem for you, challenge your need for certainty and perfectionistic attitudes wherever you see an opportunity. You can report next time which techniques you tried and which ones worked best. (Certainty and Perfectionism) 79  Continuing Exposure and Cognitive Therapy Agenda The agenda for these final exposure sessions is the same as previous ones, with the addition of beginning to return to normal behavior if your OCD symptoms disrupted everyday tasks and of doing these tasks on your own without therapist or family assistance. Focus on applying cognitive techniques using methods you have found useful. Homework Review You and your therapist should review the exposure Homework Form as well as Thought Records from this week and discuss progress and any problems you encountered. Exposure and Ritual Prevention During these two sessions, you and your therapist can plan exposures to any items from the hierarchy that continue to bother you. Sometimes treatment participants notice that some obsessive concerns that have not bothered them recently are now more disturbing. This is not a cause for concern, but you and your therapist will need to plan exposures to these new situations. Review your original hierarchy to decide what exposures you think are still needed. Try to do these as homework self-exposure as much as possible so you get plenty of experience planning and doing your own exposures. Think about any new situations that might present a challenge for you and try to include these in your last sessions or homework assignments. You will also want to gradually replace the total blocking of rituals required for exposure and ritual-prevention treatment with normal behavior whenever this is appropriate. If you have had washing or cleaning rituals, this means learning to do washing and cleaning tasks in a normal, nonritualistic way. Most OCD sufferers with other types of rituals like checking, ordering, and repeating rituals will not need to do anything different now to achieve normal behavior. However, if you have checking rituals, there may be some instances in which ordinary people would check once but not more often, so you may have to practice normal checking instead of ritualistic checking. Discuss this with your therapist to decide what to do. Cognitive Therapy You and your therapist can use your Thought Records to continue to work on cognitive problems using any of the several techniques you have already learned and found helpfuL Sometimes you may need to brainstorm to find ways to resolve problematic interpretations and assumptions. Below are listed the types of erroneous interpretations and beliefs we have described earlier: Overimportance of thoughts Need to control thoughts and/or actions Overestimating the probability or the severity of danger Concern about the consequences of anxiety and/or your ability to cope with it Excessive responsibility Overconcem about certainty or difficulty tolerating ambiguous situations Perfectionism and strict standards for your behavior If you are still having problems with some of these, go back to the session in which the cognitive therapy methods that may be useful are discussed. You have learned several different kinds of methods to help correct errors in your thinking about your OCD symptoms. These are listed below to remind you of methods that might be useful: Downward arrow to identify assumptions Identifying cognitive errors Challenging questions Survey method Continuum technique Listing the advantages and disadvantages Thought-suppression test Calculating the probability of danger 82 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsesslve-Compulslve Disorder Behavioral experiments Role playing Pie technique Courtroom approach Double-standard technique To review any of these refer to earlier sessions where they were described. Homework Your exposure and ritual-prevention homework should address remaining items that provoke discomfort for you. Work on these on your own as much as you are able. Continue to complete the Thought Record and apply useful cognitive techniques taught so far. Continuing Exposure and Cognitive Therapy 83  Relapse Prevention Agenda The agenda for this session includes homework review, planning exposure and response-prevention homework, discussion of the ending of treatment, and training to prevent a relapse of OCD symptoms. Homework Review This is the same as for previous sessions. Ending Treatment You will be finishing treatment soon and your therapist may have already scheduled a follow-up appointment. If you have concerns about stopping treatment, or if you anticipate problems, discuss these with your therapist. Preventing Relapse After treatment ends, many OeD sufferers do experience some instances of intrusive thoughts (remember this is normal for most people) or even uncontrollable urges to ritualize that disturb them. This is not unusual and is not a cause for alarm. However, to help you prevent your OCD symptoms from returning in the future and causing distress and interference in your life, you will need to anticipate and prepare to handle potentially problematic situations. We call this relapse-prevention training, and it consists of several components: Learning to anticipate stressors and risky situations Correcting faulty beliefs and assumptions Self-exposure training Seeking family support and assistance Planning lifestyle changes These skills are described in this session and the next. Anticipating Stressors and High Risk Situations It is very possible to live a life with minimal or no interference from OCD symptoms, but this kind of long-term gain requires perseverance and commitment to your personal goals. It is important to expect that your progress on OCD symptoms will not always be smooth and steady. Ups and downs are likely to happen in the coming months and may mean that you are having a lapse, but this is different from a relapse. A lapse is a temporary period in which some obsessions, compulsion, or avoidance behaviors return. This usually means that something stressful is going on in your life, and you need to pay attention to it to keep the stressor from affecting other areas of your life. Now is a good time to develop a list with your therapist of potentially stressful situations and hassles that might provoke obsessions or compulsions. Typical examples are interpersonal conflicts, extra responsibilities, fatigue or illness, a job change, media information about a new source of harm, or a serious loss. As you list potential candidates for exacerbating your OCD, consider what cognitive errors or mistaken assumptions you are most likely to make if these events occur. Practicing Stress Management When stressful events occur and cause you to be more anxious or worried than usual, like all people, you will need to have some coping skills to get through difficult periods. Without such skills, you are likely to turn to rituals because they used to help you feel better, even if this new stressor has little to do with your old obsessions. To prevent a recurrence of compulsive behavior, now is a good time to learn about stress management techniques that appeal to you and fit your lifestyle. Consider finding one of the many good books available or attending a class on this topic and beginning to incorporate some of the suggestions into your schedule. Examples include relaxation skills, meditation techniques, exercise, planned relaxing activities, and many others. Learning these strategies in advance can help prevent recurrence of serious OCD symptoms. Correcting Faulty Beliefs and Assumptions It may be helpful for you to review the cognitive-behavioral model described in session 3 to remind yourself of the principles you\\'ve been using during therapy. 86 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder You have learned a variety of skills during this treatment program, rather like having a toolbox full of tools that you can use when you need them. The basic steps you\\'ve used in the cognitive part of your treatment include: Assess your distress levels in feared obsessive situations. Identify your faulty interpretations of obsessions or intrusions. Write down your interpretations and challenge them. Generate alternative interpretations using various methods. Test your alternative interpretations using behavioral experiments. Compare the results to the predicted results. Make a list of the cognitive errors you are prone to that you have worked on during treatment. Also make a list of cognitive techniques that have worked well so far to help you challenge your mistaken attitudes. If you notice in the future that your intrusive thoughts and interpretations become troublesome, try selfmonitoring them as you did during treatment. Refer to the List of Cognitive Errors and challenging questions from the Thought Record instructions to help you correct faulty thinking. If you\\'ve had difficulty identifying exactly what you\\'re afraid at, the downward arrow technique may be helpful in figuring this out. Think about how you could conduct behavioral experiments to test predictions. You and your therapist can write down a list of techniques that you can use in case of recurrence of obsessions in future. If you tend to overestimate the importance of your intrusive thoughts or your responsibility for thoughts or events, refer to the sessions that describe treatments for these problems and include the ones you prefer in your list. You will also need to work on any perfectionistic attitudes you may hold to keep them from contributing to future difficulties. Fear of Positive Experiences We have noticed that some people with OCD avoid enjoyable experiences because they associate enjoyment with intrusive obsessions. However, to learn a new lifestyle, it is important to be able to relax and have fun to offset the stresses in your life. It is also important to build some flexibility into your life if you tend to live by strict rules. If these are problems for you, discuss how you might work on this with your therapist. For example, you may be able to design some behavioral experiments to help. Self-Exposure Training From now on, you will need to plan any exposure experiences on your own, without your therapist present. It is important to do this before treatment ends, so that you\\'re assured that you can do exposures alone jf a particular obsession begins to bother you again. If you need help working on the distinction between normal behavior and rituals, discuss this further with your therapist and develop a plan. It you have noticed any new obsessions, remember that this is common and you Relapse Prevention 87 should plan exposures for these situations, keeping a record of your anxiety during the exposure. Seeking Family Support and Assistance You and your therapist should decide whether to invite your relative(s) to attend these final sessions of treatment to agree upon a plan for support if you experience a lapse in OeD symptoms. It may be helpful for your family to have realistic expectations about future OCD symptoms and to know how to assist if lapses occur. They may also be helpful in identifying non-obsessive activities that would help you return to a normal lifestyle. If you have been living with family members but this does not seem like a good long-term plan, you and your therapist can consider what to do about this and discuss it with your family. Planning Lifestyle Changes You and your therapist will want to devote some of this session and the next to discussing important changes in lifestyle, such as working, doing more social activities, and taking on more home responsibilities. Decide what tasks should be accomplished now or after therapy ends to make progress on your goals in living. Homework If you need to do any final exposures, cognitive homework, or other homework assignment before your next and final session, decide what tasks need to be done and write these down. Your therapist may ask you to complete some forms like those you answered at the beginning of treatment, along with a questionnaire about your satisfaction with this treatment program. 88 Client Manual for Overcoming Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Relapse Prevention and Ending Treatment Agenda The agenda for this session includes homework review, discussion of the ending of treatment, and planning for the future. Homework Review You and your therapist can review your homework and decide what else you may wish to do after the therapy ends. Ending Treatment Your therapist will ask you how you feel about your experience during treatment and how you feel about stopping. You might want to review this treatment manual to remind yourself of the methods your worked on during the therapy. If you havenlt already done SOl you may want to make up a list to keep in this manual of the specific interventions you found most usefuL These are what you will need to refer as a reminder of what to do in stressful times if OeD symptoms reappear. Plan for the Future Make sure that you know the likely early warning signs of potential OCD problems and how you will respond to these. Decide what role your family members should play in helping you identify or work on resolving problems, and discuss this with them to get their agreement. You will also want to develop a clear plan to address any problems you have had in functioning at work, and in family, social, and leisure activities. You and your therapist can decide if you need a referral to other agencies for help with other problems like vocational testing, job training, marital therapy, social-skills training, joining ongoing groups, or finding leisure activities of interest. Support Groups Many OCD sufferers benefit from continued support from others who have suffered from OCD or from involvement in a support group organization such as a local Obsessive Compulsive Foundation affiliate. These connections can meet several needs. They provide social support in stressful times and social contact for enjoyment; they may occupy free time when you might be tempted to do rituals and also serve as a worthy cause for you to invest your energy in. You and your therapist can decide whether joining a support group or starting one is a good idea. Your therapist can help you find such a group and you may also want to contact the national OC Foundation (listed in the appendix) for information on OCD and on support groups in your area. Medication Issues You and your therapist can discuss your plans regarding medication changes if any. If you are considering changing your medications, it may be best to wait for about six months after therapy has ended before deciding to do this to be sure you have stabilized your gains. Sometimes reducing medication too quickly can precipitate a lapse or an episode of depression and so if you do decide to discontinue, a gradual tapering off under your psychiatrist\\'s supervision is wise. Your therapist and your psychiatrist should discuss your options to be sure they are in agreement.     The Invitation: Are You Ready to Begin the Journey to Overcome Social Anxiety? Have you ever experienced social anxiety? If you are like most people, you have had many such experiences. Social anxiety is feeling tense, nervous, or frightened in situations that involve other people. To help make this definition more clear, let\\'s take a look at Nicole in a situation that many of us will find familiar. (Note that whenever we describe our clients in this book, their names and some details are changed to protect their privacy.) Nicole recently has received the good news that she is being promoted to a supervisory position in her job. However, the morning before she starts the new job, she finds herself questioning whether the promotion is what she really wants. As part of her new responsibilities, she has to make presentations on her department\\'s activities at weekly management meetings. While preparing what she will say in her first meeting, Nicole notices that she is nervous about speaking in front of the managers, most of whom she does not know very well. She has a few butterflies in her stomach as she worries about making a good impression. After all, she does not want anyone to think that they made a mistake when they offered her the promotion! Finally, it is time for the meeting, and Nicole takes her place at the conference table. As she listens to others give their reports, her anxiety increases and her heart beats faster than normal. She tries to relax by telling herself that she is prepared and that no one expects her to be perfect on her first day. When it is Nicole\\'s turn to speak, she feels a little rush of anxiety as she looks out at all of the faces, and she stumbles over the first couple of words. However, as she gets into her report and notices that everyone seems to be listening attentively, the anXiety quickly subsides. Afterwards, Nicole wonders what she was so worried about since her report went fine. She thinks she will like her new job. The nervousness that Nicole experienced when she had to speak in front of the group is one type of social anxiety. Social anxiety in public speaking situations is 1 2 very common, and most people have some of the symptoms that Nicole hadbutterflies in her stomach, increased heart rate, worries about what others will think about her, and a bit of difficulty speaking fluently. Many people have social anXiety the first few times they have to do something such as speaking in front of a group, meeting with a new boss, going to a job interview, going to a new class or job where they do not know anyone, or getting to know someone they might like to date. This commonly experienced social anXiety is unpleasant but not unmanageable, and it goes away fairly quickly. However, as we will see in the following example, some people have a very different experience with social anXiety. Cory and Jodi have been dating for several months, and this dinner will be the first time he will meet her family. Let\\'s take a look at Cory as he is getting dressed to go to dinner with his girlfriend and her parents. He takes a deep breath to relieve his tension as he thinks to himself that worrying about this dinner has ruined his entire week. Every time he thought about it, he felt sick to his stomach. As the time draws near, he feels even more upset and nauseous. Although Cory is in his thirties, Jodi is his first girlfriend, and they started dating only because she actively pursued him. Cory never thought someone as pretty and fun as Jodi would go out with him! Now he is worried that he will make such a terrible impression on her parents that she will be embarrassed to be with him. On the way to the restaurant, Cory nearly runs off the road because he is so distracted by thoughts of the dinner. All he wants to do is run away, as far and as fast as he can. When Jodi introduces him to her parents, his heart is pounding and his palms are sweaty. He becomes convinced that her father thinks he is a loser because he looks so anxious. Throughout the dinner, Cory has to make an effort to keep track of the conversation because he keeps thinking that everything is going wrong. At the end of the evening, Cory declines Jodi\\'s parents\\' invitation to stay for coffee and dessert, claiming that he has to be at work early the next morning. The next day, Jodi tells Cory that she felt that the dinner was a big success and her mother thought it was \"sweet\" that he looked a little nervous. Unlike Nicole, Cory\\'s experience of social anxiety causes him to feel miserable and truly interferes with his life. Not only was he nervous on the day of the dinner, but he had been anxiously anticipating it all week. The social anxiety interfered with his concentration so that he had difficulty driving safely and making dinner conversation. The comment Jodi\\'s mother made about his nervousness made it clear to Cory that his anXiety was visible to Jodi\\'s parents, and he is worried about what they will think of him. As we can see, social anxiety is a normal part of life, but it can sometimes have a negative impact on an individual\\'s life. The important question is not whether someone experiences social anXiety or not, but to what degree and how often. Thus, experiencing social anxiety is not like haVing a broken arm-your arm is either broken or it is not. Rather, social anxiety is on a continuum. To illustrate, let\\'s think about how people with differing levels of social anXiety might react in Nicole\\'s and Cory\\'s situations. Individuals who experience less social anxiety than Nicole might not be at all nervous about giving a report for the first time and, in fact, might welcome the opportunity to demonstrate their talents in front of the management group. Others might have worried for several days about giving the report, perhaps even haVing difficulty sleeping the night before. People who experience more social anXiety than Nicole might have continued to be anxious throughout the presentation. They may have performed well despite the anxiety, but it is also possible that they would have had difficulty effectively communicating their main points. Aperson who experiences very high levels of social anxiety might have turned down the promotion, knOWing that giving reports was part of the job and the prospect of doing so was too terrifying to even consider. Someone who experiences much less social anxiety than Cory might have been a little nervous just before meeting Jodi\\'s parents (most people are nervous meeting prospective in-laws!) but would have quickly become more comfortable as they began to talk together. Someone who experiences more severe social anxiety than Cory might have refused to attend the dinner because he felt panicky just thinking about it, despite knowing that this would make Jodi angry and might even threaten the future of their relationship. Let\\'s consider one more example that demonstrates just how devastating social anxiety can be. Eric was a 30-year-old man who sought help with his social anxiety after reading a story in the newspaper about our treatment program. It was immediately obvious that Eric was very nervous about talking on the telephone. After a lot of encouragement, he agreed to come in and meet with a member of our staff. At the clinic, we could tell that Eric was having difficulty just sitting in the waiting room because he felt so anxious. As he talked with our staff person, he started to feel a little more comfortable and described how his social anxiety had gradually gotten worse. Eric explained that he had always been shy and nervous around people but had managed to get along in school by reading books rather than talking to others. He went to college primarily because he was too frightened to think about getting a job; college seemed a safer prospect because he knew what to expect in a school environment. Throughout college he worked at part-time jobs on campus that did not require contact with people, such as re-shelving books at the library. After he graduated, Eric was again confronted with the prospect of finding work. He lived for a couple of years off his savings, some money from his parents, and a few part-time jobs that he usually quit after a few weeks because he could not tolerate the anxiety. He had no friends. He spent some time with a cousin and lived with his parents. Finally, his parents insisted that he get a steady job, so he took a position as a night-shift janitor at the college. Eric was very anxious at first but was soon able to develop a routine that allowed him to work alone most of the night cleaning several floors of a large classroom building. Because Eric was bright, hard-working, and reliable, his supervisor tried several times to promote him to more responsible positions, but Eric always refused. Any change might require that 3 he have more contact with other people, and he did not believe he would ever be able to supervise anyone. When he was not at work, he stayed home. His one pleasure was music trivia, and he constantly read books about popular artists, listened to the radio, and watched the music channels on TV. Eric explained to our staff member that he felt nervous around almost everyone. If he had to talk with anyone, his heart would pound, and he would feel shaky all over and nauseous. When he went out in public, he felt extremely self-conscious and was convinced that everyone could see that something was wrong with him. Eric came to treatment because he was terrified at the way his life was turning out. He wanted friends and a family someday, but it was clear to him that his life was not heading in that direction. Eric\\'s parents were getting older and he feared he would be living on the street if something happened to them. Defining Social Anxiety Mental health professionals have traditionally called severe social anxiety \"social phobia.\" Recently the term \"social anxiety disorder\" has come into use. We will use sodal anxiety disorder in this manual with one exception. In Chapter 9, we describe how to overcome specific social fears like worrying that others will see your hand shake while writing a check. Because these fears tend to be very focused, we continue to use \"specific social phobias\" to describe this aspect of social anxiety disorder. Adefinition of social anxiety disorder was prOVided in 1994 by the American Psychiatric Association in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ofMental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV). DSM-IV defines social anxiety disorder as \"a marked and persistent fear of one or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or possible scrutiny by others. The person fears that he or she will act in a way (or show anxiety symptoms) that will be humiliating or embarrassing\" (p. 416). This means that the heart ofsocial anxiety disorder is anxiety due to concern about what others might think ofyou. The social and performance situations feared by people with social anxiety disorder vary Widely, but the most common ones are public speaking, conversations with unfamiliar people, dating, and being assertive. In addition, some individuals with social anxiety disorder are afraid of eating or drinking in front of other people, being the center of attention, talking with supervisors or other authority figures, urinating in a public bathroom (usually only men have this fear), or intimate sexual situations. Regardless of the specific situation, people with social anxiety disorder share a common fear that others will think poorly of them. Sometimes this worry about what others think is related to a fear of displaying a particular anxiety symptom such as blushing or trembling. 4 The following criteria must be met for an individual to be diagnosed with social anxiety disorder: 1) the person must realize that the fear is excessive and that most people would not be as frightened in a similar situation; 2) the person must avoid the situations that cause anxiety or suffer through them despite great distress; and 3) the social anxiety disorder must interfere with the person\\'s life in important ways (e.g., keep him or her from dating, going to school, doing well at work) or the person must be very upset about having the fears. Social Anxiety or Social Anxiety Disorder? up until now, we have been using the terms social anXiety disorder and social anxiety interchangeably. You might be wondering whether there is a difference between the two. As we just saw, social anxiety disorder is an official label or diagnosis that is based on the specific criteria laid out in DSM-IV. Most mental health professionals recognize that these criteria are fairly arbitrary, but it is helpful to have a standardized definition to assist clinicians and researchers in communicating with each other. Social anXiety is much more loosely defined than social anxiety disorder and simply refers to the distress a person might experience when interacting with or performing in front of other people. As we said earlier, nearly everyone experiences social anxiety sometimes, but it is usually short-lived and does not interfere with the person\\'s life. However, as social anxiety starts to become more severe or is experienced more often and in more situations, then it might be called social anxiety disorder. Because the line between the two is so arbitrary, we will use the terms interchangeably in this book. If you experience social anXiety to the extent that it causes you distress or interferes with things you want to do, then this therapy program is probably for you, regardless of whether you technically meet the criteria for social anxiety disorder. How Do I Know If This Program Is for Mel Embarking on any change program requires a commitment of substantial time and energy. Before making that investment, it is important to carefully consider whether you are ready to change and whether a particular program will meet your needs. Assess whether this program is right for you by considering the following questions. These questions present ways in which social anxiety may be negatively affecting your life. 1. Does being nervous or uncomfortable around other people keep you from doing things you want to do? 2. If you are honest with yourself, are you in your present job (or school) because you only have to deal with people you know well? If you are unemployed, have you avoided looking for a job for fear of interacting with others? Have you avoided getting a job or changing jobs because you are anxious about job interviews? 5 6 3. Are you not dating because the thought of going out with someone makes you very nervous or because you are afraid of what will happen if you ask someone out? 4. Do you limit how involved you become with people because you are afraid of letting them get to know you? Do you worry that if people really knew you, they wouldn\\'t like you? 5. Do people often comment that you are quiet, unapproachable, or withdrawn in social situations or meetings? 6. Do you find yourself turning down invitations to social events because you know you would feel uncomfortable if you went? 7. If you do make plans to go to a social event or a work activity that involves other people, do you feel relief if it is canceled? 8. Does being the center of attention make you feel very uncomfortable and self-conscious? 9. Do you worry about blushing or looking nervous in front of other people? 10. Are you the sort of person who rarely strikes up casual conversations with store clerks, neighbors, passengers sitting next to you on the bus or plane, classmates, or co-workers from other departments? 11. Do people tell you that you worry too much about what others think of you? 12. Are you uncomfortable eating or drinking with others because you worry about spilling your drink or embarrassing yourself in some other way? Do you worry that you don\\'t have good manners? 13. Do you get so nervous talking to people that your voice sounds odd or quivers or you can\\'t get your breath? 14. Do you like other people and daydream about a better social life but doubt your ability to achieve your dream because you are too shy to really get to know people? 15. Do you have trouble stating your opinion or asking for something you deserve because you worry about what others will think of you? If you said \"yes\" to any of these questions and would like to make a change in your life, then this workbook applies to you. Some people will find that almost all of these questions describe them. If that is true for you, then you have discovered that social anxiety is probably limiting. Don\\'t be concerned. Answering yes to lots of the questions just means that you are likely to find this program particularly helpful. Will This Program Work for Me? This program is a comprehensive approach to the treatment of social anxiety and social anxiety disorder. This may lead you to ask whether this program is effective and, more important, whether it will be effective for you. Because each person is an individual, with a unique background, personality, and daily liVing situation, it is impossible to guarantee that this program will help you overcome your social anxiety or social anxiety disorder. That\\'s the bad news. The good news is that there are many reasons to believe that you will see a significant decrease in social anxiety if you follow the procedures carefully. That optimism is based on a large body of scientific research. Let us tell you a bit about that research. The treatment approach described in this manual was first developed by Dr. Richard Heimberg in the early 1980s, at the time that social anxiety disorder was first officially recognized as a unique type of anxiety problem. In the first carefully controlled scientific study using this treatment, 75% of the participants were rated as haVing made major improvements in their social anxiety disorder symptoms. The participants reported that they were much less anxious in the situations they had feared prior to treatment. Six months after treatment they came back to the clinic for evaluation and were usually still doing well. We later contacted as many of the people who had participated in this study as we could locate to see if they continued to do well or if their social anxiety disorder had returned. If the positive effects of treatment \"wear off\" and a person starts to get anxious again in many social situations, then the treatment has not been long lasting. The results, however, were positive: five years after the treatment, most of the participants we contacted continued to show the benefits of treatment. Since that first study in the 1980s, there have been at least 10 other scientific studies that have investigated whether the treatment procedures described in this manual (or very similar ones) reduce social anxiety and social anxiety disorder. These studies have included hundreds of participants and have been conducted in the United States, Australia, Great Britain, the Netherlands, and other European countries. Overall, these studies show that most people make significant improvement with the treatment. In the studies we have conducted, about 80% of the participants made substantial progress in treatment. You might be asking yourself what is \"significant improvement\" or \"substantial progress\"? Does that mean the participants overcame all of their social anxiety? Since social anxiety is a normal part of life, it cannot be fully eliminated. However, we use careful scientific criteria to assure that the improvement that people make in treatment is large enough that it leads to important changes in their lives. When Linda first came to our treatment program, she was 35 years old and working as a clerk in a state office. Linda had graduated from college several years earlier and had taken a number of classes toward a master\\'s degree in social work. 7 She disliked her current job and was eager to finish her degree so she could pursue her chosen profession. However, Linda was extremely frightened about giving presentations in class and was unable to take any class that required speaking, even informally, in the classroom. She worried that she would stumble over her words, lose her train of thought, and generally appear incompetent and foolish. Linda participated in 12 weeks of the group version of the treatment described in this manual. By the end of therapy, she would get a little nervous at the beginning of a presentation in the group but felt the anxiety was manageable. As treatment ended, she signed up for one of the classes she had been avoiding, and felt fairly confident about being able to complete the required class presentation. Although she thought she might always be a little nervous talking in front of others, Linda felt that she would be able to handle any anxiety that arose. About a year later, she sent her therapists a note reporting that she had finished her social work degree and had found a position she was enjoying. Jim was a 36-year-old man who had never been married when he sought treatment to help with his anxiety in dating situations. Actually, Jim became anxious almost any time he had to talk with someone, but it was worse with women, and he very much wanted to develop a serious relationship. By the end of three months of treatment, Jim felt much more confident in social situations and had become involved with a singles\\' outdoor recreational group. He was making an effort to ask women for dates on a regular basis, even if he was only somewhat interested in them. These dates were casual in the sense that Jim did not have to be ready to marry someone to invite that p~rson to a movie. Six months after the end of therapy, Jim reported to his therapist that one of these casual dates had turned into a more serious relationship and they had even begun to discuss marriage. What Can I Do to Get the Most Out of This Program? There are no guarantees that the therapy described in this workbook will help you conquer your social anxiety, but scientific research has shown it to be helpful for literally hundreds of people. However, there are some things you can do to help you get as much benefit from a therapy program as possible. Seriously invest in change. No matter what anyone tells you, making personal changes is hard workI Overcoming social anxiety is no exception. To get as much out of this program as possible, you must invest both your time and your emotional resources. This means setting aside time at least several times a week to work on your social anxiety in addition to participating in a structured therapy session. The work might include doing some of the exercises in this book, talking to someone you wouldn\\'t normally talk with, or practicing the self-help skills you will learn. In fact, the more practice the better, so if you can spend even 20-30 minutes a day, you will see progress. 8 In addition to investing time, you must invest emotional resources. By this we mean two things. First, some of the exercises in this book will make you uncomfortable or possibly even very anxious. Although it seems a little odd, you must be willing to experience some anxiety in order to overcome it. We have a slogan for this-Invest Anxiety in a Calmer Future. This means that you must face your fears in order to overcome them. You do not have to face the worst ones first, but you will have to gradually try some things you have been avoiding. Done systematically, that investment will payoff. Second, you must invest emotionally by being honest with yourself and with your therapist. As you start to analyze some of the thoughts and fears you have about yourself and the world around you, you might find that some of them are embarrassing or seem childish to you. Speak up about them. The thoughts and fears that cause you the most distress are the most important ones to talk about. Not talking about what concerns you makes your therapist\\'s job very difficult. Do the exercises carefully and practice, practice, practice! All of the exercises in this book have been carefully designed to help you progress through the program step by step. Most exercises build on previous ones, so it is important to do each one carefully. Once you have become an expert at all of the skills, you might find shortcuts that work for you. However, doing the procedures carefully at first will assure that you have all the tools needed to cope with the anxiety you might experience as you try the more advanced procedures. The more you rehearse the exercises, the more quickly the skills you learn will become new habits that replace old, problematic habits. And one of the best things about habits is that they require very little effort. Persevere. If you are like most people, you have had problems with social anxiety for a long time, maybe even most of your life. If overcoming social anxiety were easy, you would have done it already. That is why it is important to stick with the program even if it does not seem to be working right away. We have included techniques to monitor your progress. Change usually starts slowly, so pay attention to small improvements. Small improvements usually lead to larger ones with time, patience, and practice. Be kind to yourself. It is easy to focus on what you want to change or things you don\\'t do as well as you would like. It is not always easy to give yourself credit for your efforts. As you work through the program, give yourself a pat on the back as often as possible. Look for things you are making progress on and celebrate them rather than beating yourself up for not yet reaching other goals. Later we will devote a lot of attention to \"disqualifying the positive\" because individuals with social anxiety are often their own worst critics. Most people find that being critical of themselves doesn\\'t help them change. It just makes them feel miserable! Be willing to try new ways and give up old ways of dealing with your social anxiety. If you have been using drugs or alcohol to help control your anxiety, discuss that openly and honestly with your therapist. This program is 9 unlikely to work if you rely more on drugs or alcohol than the procedures you will be learning. If you use alcohol or street drugs like marijuana to control your anxiety, be honest with yourself and your therapist about how much you drink or smoke. If you cannot do the exercises without /Ichemical assistance,\" then you should seriously consider seeking treatment for the substance abuse problem as well. If you take prescription medication for anxiety on an \"as needed\" basis, try not to take it when you are doing the exercises, especially the ones that ask you to try to enter new situations. If you take prescription medication for anxiety on a daily basis, discuss with your therapist or physician whether you should stop or reduce the medication before beginning this program. If you are still experiencing social anxiety despite the medication, you might be able to continue the medication for now as you try this treatment. However, these are complicated decisions that should be made on an individual basis, so it is important to discuss them frankly with your therapist. See Chapter 14 for further discussion about medications in the treatment of social anxiety. To a great extent, whether this program works for you is under your control. If you are honestly ready to invest the time and energy in change and work carefully through the program, our experience treating hundreds of people suggests that you will be able to overcome your social anxiety. If at this point you (or you and your therapist) agree that this approach would be helpful to you, take a deep breath and we\\'ll start this exciting journey together. Overview of This Treatment Program This client workbook describes a step-by-step therapy approach for overcoming social anxiety and social anxiety disorder. It is designed to be used while working with a therapist who has been trained to use cognitive-behavioral treatment for social anxiety. Scientific studies show that therapy that uses this approach is effective. If you are reading this workbook and are not in therapy, you may use it to consider whether or not to seek a therapist at this time. Chapters 2 and 3 provide background information on social anxiety and social anxiety disorder and on related problems like shyness. These chapters will develop a common language that is used in the rest of the manual and will help you understand that many other people experience the same discomfort that you do around people. Chapter 2 also explains how what you do and what you think work together to keep you from overcoming your fears. Most important, Chapter 3 explains the rationale behind the program-what needs to change in order for you to feel more comfortable in the situations that currently make you nervous. 10 In Chapter 4, you will learn how to analyze your social fears and understand exactly what it is about different situations that makes you anxious. You will also learn some self-monitoring skills that will help you track your progress through the program. Self-monitoring is particularly important because people with social anxiety often ignore any successes they might have in social situations. It is critically important for you to become aware of the things that go well for you in social and performance situations so that you can learn to give yourself credit for them. Right now you probably have no trouble blaming yourself for the things that do not go so well; self-monitoring will help you develop a more balanced approach to how you reward and punish yourself. Chapters 5 and 6 will help you gain important self-help skills, known as cognitive restructuring skills, to help you overcome your anxiety. Through careful step-by-step exercises, you will become a sophisticated scientist who seeks out problematic thoughts and subjects them to rigorous tests of logic. That is, you will learn to treat your thoughts about social situations just as if they were the hypotheses in a scientific experiment. The cognitive restructuring skills you learn in Chapters 5 and 6 will help you control your anxiety as you begin to do some of the things that your anxiety has kept you from doing. Chapters 7 and 8 describe a systematic approach to putting yourself in anxiety-provoking situations. By starting with situations that cause you only a little bit of anxiety and gradually working up to more difficult situations, you will soon be able to do some of the things you have been avoiding (or doing only with great anxiety!). Once you have all of the basic skills in place, Chapters 9 through 11 address some common problematic beliefs and difficult situations that we have seen in our years working with socially anxious individuals. Topics like public speaking, making small talk, and worries about specific symptoms of anxiety such as hand tremors will give you further opportunities to practice the skills learned in earlier chapters while addressing a specific concern related to your own profile of social anxiety. Not all of these chapters may appear relevant to you at first, but as you work through each one, you will likely find some helpful pointers. You should read Chapters 12 and 13 after you have been using the procedures for several weeks. These chapters describe how to consolidate the gains you have already made and to move on to a more advanced level. Chapter 13 also talks about how to handle the I/fallout\" that comes with making changes in your life, including the reactions of any friends or family. Chapters 4 through 13 cover the main part of the treatment that we have developed in our research program over the last 18 years. For most people, these procedures will be all that is needed to overcome their social anxiety. The manual ends with a chapter on medication for social anxiety disorder (Chapter 14). We are fortunate to have Michael Liebowitz, M.D., Director of the Anxiety Disorders 11 Clinic at New York State Psychiatric Institute and an international expert on medication for social anxiety disorder, prepare this chapter.

Starting Our Journey Together From the Same Place: Understanding Social Anxiety In the first chapter, we talked about how social anxiety is a normal part of life, but that sometimes it becomes a problem. We asked you to think about a series of questions to help you figure out if social anxiety is a problem in your life. We explained that social anxiety disorder is the official name for more severe kinds of social anxiety that keep a person from doing the things he or she wants to do. In this chapter, we are going to tell you a lot more about social anxiety, including some ideas about what might cause it and how it comes to interfere in people\\'s lives. This will give us a common language and understanding as we begin the journey toward overcoming social anxiety together. But first, let\\'s consider exactly what we mean by the word \"anxiety.\" Imagine this scene... Bill is sitting in a meeting and someone hands him a note. The note states that Dennis, who was supposed to give the financial report, has had to leave abruptly for a family emergency. Dennis will not be able to give the financial report and wants Bill to stand in for him. The report is attached to the note. Bill has never seen it before, and he will have no time to study it because it is next on the agenda. As he sits there staring at the report, Bill realizes that it will be impossible to figure it out before he has to stand up and speak in front of the whole group. Bill would be nervous standing up in front of everyone even if he were prepared, but this is much worse. He immediately feels himself becoming very anxious. What do you think it means that Bill is lIanxious/? In this case, Bill feels his heart pounding, and he is getting very warm. He worries that he will look stupid as he tries to present the report, particularly if his voice shakes and his mind goes blank. He considers sneaking out and not giVing the report at all. After all, if he is really nervous, he is sure that he will just look down at the report and mumble so no one will be able to hear him anyway. 13 As we can see in this example, being IIanxious\" is not just one thing. Anxiety includes what you feel in your body (e.g., the pounding of your heart), what you think (e.g., \"I\\'ll look stupid\"), and what you do (e.g., sneak out). Psychologists talk about the three components, or parts, of anxiety. These are the physiological component, the cognitive component, and the behavioral component. We\\'ll talk about each of these in detaiL The Three Components of Anxiety The Physiological Component This aspect of anxiety describes the feelings you get in your body when you are anxious. This is a very important part of anxiety and often the first that people think about. In the situation described above, we see that Bill had three main physical symptoms-palpitations (the pounding of his heart), flushing (getting \"warm\"), and shaky hands. Figure 2.1 presents a list of the physical symptoms that people sometimes experience when they are anxious. ObViously, you can experience these symptoms for other reasons-a person can be nauseous because of anxiety or because of the spicy burrito at lunch! On rare occasions, these symptoms may suggest a medical problem as well. For example, chest pain can indicate some sort of heart problem and nausea could be related to an ulcer. However, if you notice that you get these symptoms only when you are worried or frightened about something, then the symptoms are most likely part of your anxiety experience. Palpitations (heart pounding) Tachycardia (heart racing) Dizziness Nausea Smothering sensations Lump in the throat Shakiness (hands, head, knees) Blurred vision Headaches Depersonalization (feeling as if you or your surroundings are not the way they should be) \", :\"\\'\":\\'<::<f::1\",\\'i\\':::\\' . ..figure 2;1. . Common Physical Symptoms of Anxiety 14 Muscle aches Tightness in the chest Pain in the chest Ringing in the ears Shortness of breath Diarrhea Flushing Blushing Chills Parathesias (tingling in the fingers, toes, face) About one-third of the general population and one of two people with social anxiety disorder have had a very particular combination of physical symptoms called a \"panic attack.\" Apanic attack is a quick rush of anxiety that includes at least four of the symptoms listed in Figure 2.2. People sometimes say that a panic attack feels like a sudden rush of adrenaline. The anxiety usually stays at the highest peak for only a few minutes (10-15 minutes at the most) and then starts to subside. 1. palpitations (heart pounding) or tachycardia (heart racing) 2. dizziness, unsteady feelings or faintness 3. nausea, abdominal distress 4. shortness of breath or smothering sensations 5. trembling or shaking 6. sweating 7. choking 8. numbness or tingling sensations 9. hot flushes or chills 10. depersonalization or derealization 11. chest pain or discomfort 12. fear of dying 13. fear of going crazy or doing something uncontrolled Figure 2.2. Having 4 of these 13 symptoms all together in a rush of anxiety that peaks quickly then starts to subside is considered a \"panic attack.\" Symptoms of a Panic Attack Note. Reprinted with permission from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual ofMental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV). Copyright 1994 by the American Psychiatric Association. You may have noticed that the last two symptoms on the list in Figure 2.2-fears of dying or going crazy/doing something uncontrolled-are not physical symptoms. When people experience a panic attack, especially for the first time, they often believe they are having a heart attack or losing their mind. This is because the symptoms can be very intense and frightening, especially if they seem to come from out of the blue. This brings us to an important distinction. If you experience panic attacks but they occur only when you encounter a social or performance situation that frightens you, then the treatment described in this manual is probably appropriate for you. However, if your panic attacks seem to occur spontaneously, or at times you would not expect them to, then you may have a related but different problem called \"panic disorder.\" Individuals with panic disorder are most worried about the physical symptoms they are experiencing (e.g., pounding heart or shortness of breath) and what those symptoms mean for their physical or mental health or mortality (e.g., that they are dying or going crazy). On the other hand, a person with social anXiety disorder who experiences panic attacks is usually much more concerned about other people seeing their anxiety than about the physical symptoms themselves. 15 16 If you think you might have panic disorder, discuss it with your therapist. It is also possible to have both social anxiety disorder and panic disorder at the same time. Although some of the treatment techniques used in this manual are similar to those used for panic disorder, there are some special techniques for panic that are highly effective. These techniques are described in another manual in this series: Mastery ofYouT Anxiety and Panic-Third Edition (MAP 3) by David H. Barlow and Michelle G. Craske. Let\\'s take a minute to think about the physical symptoms you experience when you become anxious in a social or performance situation. Figure 2.3 is a form entitled \"Physical Symptoms of Social Anxiety That I Experience.\" (A sample form filled out for Bill appears in Figure 2.4.) Think about a recent situation in which you became anxious. Describe it briefly in the space provided and check off all of the symptoms on the form that you remember having in that situation in the column labeled \"Most Recent.\" Note any symptoms that are not on the list under \"Other.\" Now look over the symptoms you checked and circle the one or two that are the most severe (or that concern you the most). Then think about the time that your social anxiety was the worst you ever experienced. This may have been recently or a long time ago. Although it will probably make you a little uncomfortable to think about it, try to remember exactly how you felt, where you were, what was happening, and so forth. Mter you have a strong memory of your worst experience with social anxiety, describe it briefly in the space provided, then check off any of the symptoms you experienced in the column labeled \"Worst. II People generally have a few more physiological symptoms when they are most anxious but there are usually some symptoms that they \"typicallyII get. As you can see on Bill\\'s form, he listed the experience with the financial report as the recent situation in which he felt anxious. He checked three physical symptoms for that experience-palpitations, shakiness, and flushinglblushing. For the worst experience with social anxiety he could remember, he wrote about a speech he had to give in his 11th grade English class. This is a very painful memory for Bill because he remembers being extremely anxious. He had been dreading giving the 5-minute speech for weeks but could not figure any way to get out of it. On the day of the speech he felt a little better and thought he might get through it. Then, as he started talking, he felt a huge rush of anxiety. His chest tightened up and he felt like he could not breathe, his heart started pounding, and his voice sounded so funny that a couple of students snickered in the back of the room. He skipped class the rest of the week because he was so embarrassed about what had happened. The Cognitive Component As we have seen, Bill was very aware of the physiological component of his anxiety. However, he was probably less tuned into the other components of the experience. Let\\'s look at the cognitive component. \"Cognitive\" is the word psychologists use for thoughts and thought processes. Bill is thinking, l/I\\'lllook stupid,\" and is concerned that his mind will go blank. Anxious thoughts often involve a prediction that something bad will happen, as was the case for Bill.

Figure2.4.;< Physical Symptoms of Social Anxiety That Bill Experiences 18 D o D Individuals with social anxiety often have thoughts about their own performance (\"I won\\'t know what to say to her,\" \"I\\'ll stumble over my words and look dumb\") or what someone else might think about them CIHe\\'ll think I\\'m weird,\" \"They\\'ll think I\\'m boring,\" \"She thinks I\\'m incompetent\"). Do these thoughts sound familiar? Let\\'s take a look at some of the thoughts you have when you are anxious. Go back to the recent anxiety experience you listed when you described your physical symptoms of anxiety and record the same situation on Figure 2.5, IIThoughts Related to an Anxiety-Provoking Situation.\" Asample form forBill appears in Figure 2.6. Write down as many thoughts as you can remember having. Put one thought on each line. Consider thoughts you might have had in anticipation of the event and after the event, as well as during it. Sometimes it is the anticipation of something that makes us most anxious. Now go back and look at the thoughts you listed. Did you ever question these thoughts or ask yourself if they were realistic? Sometimes the thoughts are true but more often they represent our worst fears, rather than what actually happens. Our anxieties often prevent us from looking at a situation objectively. In later chapters we will look carefully at the thoughts you are having and probably uncover some that you may not be aware of at this point. Learning to think differently in situations that make you anxious is an important step toward overcoming your social anxiety. The Behavioral Component We have discussed two of the three components of anxiety (physiological and cognitive), and now we turn to the third-the behavioral component. When psychologists talk about Ilbehavior,\" they usually mean anything that you can observe another person doing. Walking, smiling, sneezing, and juggling are all Ilbehaviors\" because you can look at someone and see whether they are doing one of these or not. You do not have to ask them. (Although some psychologists consider thinking an IIinternal behavior,\" for our purposes we will consider thinking as separate from observable behavior.) It is often helpful to think about the behavioral component of anxiety as having two parts of its own. The first is what you do in an anxiety-provoking situation. Think of the anxious young man who looks down at his shuffling feet as he attempts to talk with an attractive young woman. Shuffling feet and reduced eye contact are behaviors often associated with anxiety. Let\\'s go back to Bill, whose friend Dennis left him to give the financial report, and see what anxious behaviors he was concerned about displaying. Bill thought that he would look only at the report, not the audience, and that he would mumble. These are behaviors you would be able to observe if you were in the room when Bill gave the report. The second part of the behavioral component of anxiety is avoidance. Avoidance involves either not doing something that frightens you or doing it in a way that you stay away from the most frightening aspects of the anxiety-provoking 19 Thoughts Related to an Anxiety-Provoking Situation Briefly describe a recent social or performance situation in which you were anxious: List as many thoughts as you can remember about that situation.

For example, if you experience social anxiety when talking with unfamiliar people, you might turn down an invitation to attend a party where you won\\'t know many people. This would be avoiding the party altogether and is a behavioral sign of anxiety. On the other hand, you might go to the party, even though you are anxious, and spend the entire evening in the kitchen talking with the few people you already know and with whom you feel comfortable. Although you did not avoid the party entirely, you avoided the part that makes you the most anxious, namely talking with strangers. Going back to Bill for a moment, we can see that he considered sneaking out to avoid giving the report. Avoidance behavior is a particularly interesting aspect of anxiety because it is an effective short-term solution to reducing you anxiety! Let\\'s assume that Bill decided to sneak out of the meeting so he would not have to give the financial report. Imagine Bill getting up and walking out the door. How do you think Bill feels as soon as the door doses behind him? He probably feels an immediate decrease in his anxiety as he realizes he will not have to do something that frightens him. Thus, avoidance is an effective way to reduce anxiety in the short run. However, what happens if we follow Bill for a little longer in our imagination? As time goes by, how might he feel about having avoided giving the report? Again, if he is like most people, he will start to feel badly about himself. He might tell himself that he is weak or incompetent and he might feel depressed. He might be angry with himself for not being able to give the report and angry with Dennis for putting him in the situation in the first place. In fact, Bill might now be in an awkward situation because he has to face Dennis and tell him he did not give the report. It might be difficult for Bill to go back to the next meeting of this group because he may wonder what people were thinking about his leaving so suddenly. So, as we can see, avoidance may decrease anxiety initially but it usually creates other bad feelings and problems as well. Avoidance is often a big problem for people with social anxiety because avoiding a few situations that make you anxious can quickly snowball into a general pattern of avoiding lots of situations. Trying to stop avoiding anxiety-provoking situations is difficult because of the immediate relief from anxiety that avoidance provides. This sense of relief \"rewards\" you for avoiding. Anything a person does that gets rewarded is more likely to be done again in the future. If you do something (like leave a situation that makes you nervous) and something good happens (like a decrease in your anxiety), then you will probably do it again. It matters less that avoidance might make you feel bad later. What does matter is that the immediate decrease in anxiety is a very powerful pay-off. Let\\'s take a moment to examine how often you avoid situations that make you anxious. Think about the last week or two. Was there anything that you should have done or would like to have done but did not do because of anxiety? Did you eat by yourself or join your co-workers for lunch? Did you take the opportunity to chat with the attractive single man or woman who started a conversation with you? Did you raise your hand to volunteer when they were looking for help with the new project at work/school/church/community organization? Sometimes avoidance can be very subtle, and most people who have trouble with social anxiety are avoiding more than they think they are. Avoiding means missing out on opportunities to make friends, meet prospective spouses, gain new opportunities at work or school, and make contributions to your family or community. Avoidance has as much to do with those things you never start as with those you stop. Interadion of the Physiological, Cognitive, and Behavioral Components When a person becomes anxious, he or she rarely experiences just one of the components of anxiety. In fact, the cognitive, physiological, and behavioral components of anxiety interact with each other, and an increase or decrease in one may cause increases or decreases in the other two. Let\\'s look at an example of how this might work. Cathy started her job as a clerical worker in a large company about a year ago. She had understood that after she had been there a year, she would get a raise in pay if her performance evaluations were good. Her last evaluation was excellent, but nothing has been said about a raise, and her co-workers say that this is unusual. In fact, Cathy took on extra responsibilities after a part-time person quit a few months ago. Cathy has been wanting to speak with her supervisor about a raise but the thought of doing so makes her very anxious. She has a meeting with her supervisor this morning about a project she has been working on and she plans to bring up her salary at the end of the meeting. When Cathy woke up this morning, her first thought was about the meeting: \"Something must be wrong with my work, or they would have given me a raise.\" Since this is a thought related to her anxiety, we have placed it first in Figure 2.7 and labeled it \"Cognition.\" Let\\'s follow along with Cathy and see how the three components of anxiety interact with each other. As Cathy starts her day, she notices that she has a tight feeling in her stomach, and the muscles in her shoulders and back are tense. She also notices that she is distracted and accidentally knocks an entire stack of files off her desk. As she picks the files off the floor, she thinks, \"I\\'m so incompetent! No wonder they won\\'t give me a raise.\" Just then she notices that her heart is starting to beat faster and the back of her neck has begun to ache from the tense muscles. Cathy tries to keep working but cannot sit still. Every few minutes she finds herself jumping out of her seat to do some unnecessary task. She thinks to herself that if her supervisor had thought she deserved a raise, she would have already been given one. Asking for a raise is probably too \"pushy.\" Cathy is still worried about being too pushy as she goes into the meeting with her supervisor. By then she is feeling a little short of breath and her hands are shaking as she knocks on the office door. During the meeting Cathy keeps haVing images of her boss laughing aloud as she thinks, \"She\\'lliaugh when I ask for a raise because I\\'m 23 Summary 24 so nervous that I\\'ll look ridiculous.\" Throughout the meeting, Cathy\\'s foot taps on the floor and, as the meeting draws to a close, her heart starts pounding. By then she is feeling extremely anxious and thinks, \"I\\'m too nervous to talk with her. I won\\'t do it right and I\\'ll get fired.\" She leaves the meeting without asking about the raise. She immediately starts to feel calmer as her heart slows down and her muscles begin to relax. However, a little while later she feels sad and says to herself, \"I\\'m such a loser! I don\\'t deserve a raise anyway.\" As you can see in Figure 2.7, the physiological, behavioral, and cognitive components of Cathy\\'s anxiety built on each other. As she had an anxious thought, her heart started pounding and her muscles tensed up. Then when she noticed her physical and behavioral symptoms, she had more anxious thoughts until she spiraled down to the point that she was unable to ask for the raise. As described above, when she first avoided asking for the raise, she felt better. Later, however, she was upset about haVing avoided facing her supervisor, and she still did not have the raise she deserved! As you can see, the cognitive, behavioral, and physiological components of anxiety work together and can create a downward spiral that leads to missed opportunities and bad feelings. Most people we have worked with say that this situation sounds all too familiar. As you might guess, the solution involves interrupting the process before it gets out of control. Where did things start to go wrong for Cathy? The downward spiral started with a thought: \"Something must be wrong with my work or they would have given me a raise.\" One can well imagine that Cathy\\'s experience would have turned out differently if she had started with a different thought, such as \"I deserve to know why they have not given me the raise that was promised.\" If you can learn to recognize the signs that the anxiety spiral is starting and you have the tools to change what is happening, then you can begin to overcome the anxiety and take charge of your life. In the rest of this manual, you will learn more about yourself and about the tools you need to do just that. The purpose of this chapter was to develop a common language and understanding about sodal anxiety. As you have seen, the word \"anxiety\" does not mean just one thing. AnXiety has three parts and each may be experienced differently by different people. By now you and your therapist should have a general idea of how the physiological, behavioral, and cognitive components of anxiety play out for you. Understanding your anxiety reaction and learning to monitor the symptoms is an important first step in overcoming sodal anxiety. 9.

The Downward Spiral of Anxiety 25 Homework During the upcoming week, we would like you to monitor all three components of anxiety in one or two situations in which you get anxious. This will give you practice in paying attention to what anxiety feels like for you. You probably already know that anxiety feels uncomfortable and may make you want to leave the situation. Now you can break down that reaction and begin to identify the details (physical symptoms, behaviors, specific thoughts) of your experience. Figure 2.8, entitled IIMonitoring the Three Components of Sodal Anxiety,\" is to be used with this assignment. Any situation that comes up during your week will work for this assignment as long as you experience some social anxiety. It does not have to be a particularly difficult situation, but the anxiety should be high enough that it makes you uncomfortable. If you do not encounter an anxietyprovoking situation this week, then sit down and imagine one that you had recently. Try to recreate the situation in your mind, then fill out the form. We have included a completed form in Figure 2.9 for Cathy, the person we just described who wanted to ask for a raise. ,Self-Assessment .. 1. Anxiety includes four components: behavioral, physical, cognitive, T F and avoidance. 2. The physical symptoms of anxiety can include tachycardia T F (rapid heartbeat), blurred vision, fever, and shortness of breath. 3. If you asked three people if they\\'ve ever had a panic attack, T F probably at least one would say yes. 4. Anxious thoughts, which occur with social anxiety, are usually T F predictions that something bad is going to happen. 5. Avoidance of scary situations makes you feel better immediately and T F is also an effective long-term strategy to reduce your social anxiety.

Sample Form for Cathy 28 More About Social Anxiety and This Treatment Program In the first part of this chapter we will examine the possible causes of social anxiety disorder. As you will see, there are no definite answers about the causes of this disorder, but there is good scientific research about what factors may contribute to it. The good news is that we do not have to understand what caused your social anxiety in order to treat it. However, understanding more about how social anxiety makes life difficult will help explain the rationale for this treatment program. The second part of this chapter will describe the rationale for the treatment program underlying this workbook. Possible Causes of Social Anxiety Most psychologists agree that social anxiety disorder, like most other psychological disorders, is not caused by just one thing, but results from a combination of factors including genetics, experiences in your family, and other experiences you have had. We will talk about each of these in turn. Genetics: Is Social Anxiety in Your Genes7 No one has found the gene that \"causes\" social anxiety disorder, and it is unlikely that one exists. However, scientific research over the last 20 years indicates that sodal anXiety probably has a genetic component, at least for some people. Two lines of evidence support this belief. First, psychologists have looked at social anxiety disorder in twins and found that if one twin is sodally anxious, the other is also likely to be socially anxious. This likelihood increases if the twins are identical twins (come from one egg and have identical genes) than if they are fraternal twins. The second line of evidence that social anxiety disorder has a genetic component comes from work byJerome Kagan and his colleagues at Harvard University. Dr. Kagan has described what he calls \"behavioral inhibition to the unfamiliar\" in 29 30 some infants who are only a few months old. Dr. Kagan has followed some of these infants to the age of 7 and found that three-fourths of the infants who were uncomfortable with the unfamiliar continued to be shy and three-fourths of the infants who were not uncomfortable were not shy at age 7. Because this discomfort or shyness can be identified so early in life and seems to last as the child develops, it seems likely that it is genetically transmitted. If you are like most people with social anxiety, you are not surprised that genetics probably contributes to the development of this problem. There are probably other members of your family who are socially anxious or at least a little bit shy. In fact, someone with social anxiety disorder is about three times as likely to have a close family member with the same disorder as someone who does not have any problems with anxiety. It appears that social anxiety disorder \"runs in families.\" If the disorder is caused by bad (or at least unfortunate) genes, then you are probably stuck with it, right? Wrong. If you look back at the twin research described above, you will see that not everybody with an identical twin who had social anxiety disorder was socially anxious themselves. Similarly, about a quarter of Kagan\\'s shy and uncomfortable infants were not shy a few years later. This is because the genetic contribution to social anxiety disorder, as for other psychological problems, is a predisposition, not a blueprint. Agenetic predisposition means that, all things being equal, if you have inherited certain genes related to shyness, there is an increased likelihood that you will be shy. However, regardless of a genetic predisposition, the life experiences you have strongly influence whether or not you will be socially anxious and how severe that social anxiety will be. Families provide most of our experiences in early life so we will look next at how families might contribute to the development of social anxiety. Family Environment Much of what we know about ourselves, other people, and how the world operates we learned from our family while we were growing up. Although it is unlikely that our personality is set in stone by age 5 as psychologists once believed, certainly our fundamental beliefs about life start to form in early childhood. These beliefs include whether or not you can trust other people, whether events happen to us in a predictable or unpredictable fashion, whether life is under our control or whether we are mostly vulnerable to the whims of fate and powerful other people. We also start to learn whether we are valuable and worthwhile individuals. We learn all of these basic principles by watching and listening to those around us. If one or both parents have social anxiety, then their child might learn to be socially anxious by watching how the parents handle social situations. For example, if the parents tend not to socialize with other people, then the child probably will not socialize a lot and will not value social activity as an important part of life. In fact, several studies have found that the families of people with social anxiety disorder tend not to socialize with other families, even compared to people who have problems with other types of anxiety such as agoraphobia. Similarly, a parent who looks nervous around other people and seems worried about what others think communicates to the child that social interactions are not safe and that one must always be on guard. Parents can also teach children to avoid feared social situations by refusing invitations themselves or suggesting avoidance as a coping strategy when the child is anxious. For example, if 7-yearold Andrea is scared about going to her friend\\'s birthday party, a socially anxious parent might be sYmpathetic and encourage her to stay home, telephoning the friend to say that she is ill. Certainly we are not suggesting that parents should force children to do everything that scares them, but by consistently offering avoidance as an option, parents can teach their child it is better to avoid than to try to push ahead and overcome the fear. Important Experiences Sometimes people we have treated for social anxiety disorder say that there were particular experiences that made them socially anxious. Achild or adolescent who is \"different\" in some way from his or her peers may start to develop social anxiety. One person told us that he became nervous around others when he was teased for stuttering. Although the stuttering had mostly disappeared through speech therapy, as an adult he was still uncomfortable talking with people he did not know well. Another man who came from a lOVing but very poor family said that his social anxiety started during his wedding to a college classmate who came from a wealthy family. He was so afraid that he would do something socially inappropriate during the wedding that he began to sweat profusely. People commented on his nervousness and perspiration, and from that point on, he was nervous around people he perceived as higher in social status than his own family. Although he had achieved significant financial and social success, most of his co-workers and acquaintances caused him serious anxiety as he worried that they would discover that he \"didn\\'t belong.\" For some individuals, the beginning of their problems with social anxiety is having a panic attack in a social situation. For example, people with very severe pUblic speaking anxiety sometimes remember a particular incident in which they had a huge rush of anxiety symptoms (panic attack) while giving a speech. Some individuals were able to finish their speeches, but others had to stop. Since these experiences often happen in school, people may remember being teased or laughed at by their classmates and feeling humiliated. The memory of this situation often haunts them whenever they need to speak in front of a group, so they are likely to avoid doing so. Avoidance prevents the opportunity to have a more successful experience, and the bad experience continues to control them. Pulling It AU Together: The Interaction of Genetics, Family Environment and Important Life Experiences We have seen that there are three primary causes of social anxiety disorder: a genetic predisposition to be anxious and withdrawn, learning experiences within one\\'s family, and other unique or traumatic experiences. These are represented in Figure 3.1 as slices of a pie. Not all of these factors are equally important for 31 everyone with social anxiety disorder. However, we believe that most individuals who seek treatment are probably born with a tendency to be shy and to withdraw from new situations. If this tendency combines with particular experiences as one grows up, then the person may develop dysfunctional ways of thinking about the world and about what happens to them. We will briefly examine some of these dysfunctional thinking patterns. Other Life Experiences Genetics Family Environment The size or importance of each \"slice\" varies from person to person. Contributions to the Development of Social Anxiety Dysfunctional Thinking Patterns L External Locus of Control. There is a great deal of research showing that people who are anxious or depressed have an \"external locus of control.II That is, the person believes that something outside of him- or herself determines what will happen. Persons with social anxiety disorder believe that other, more capable and competent people control what will happen. Take the example of a man asking a woman to accompany him to a movie. If this man is socially anxious, then he believes it is totally up to her to say yes or no. He probably expects her to say no. However, if the man is not socially anxious, he probably believes he has some influence over her response. He may believe that he can talk her into going, that he will be able to flirt with her so that she will want to go, or that she will be flattered by his interest. This is known as an \"internal locus of control\" because the person believes that something inside of himself or herself influences what will happen. In most instances, people with social anxiety disorder underestimate the control or influence they may have on other people\\'s positive reactions to them. 32 2. Perfectionistic Standards. Some socially anxious people set very high standards for their behavior in social situations. They also believe that other people\\'s standards for them are unrealistically high. Along with these expecta~ tions is the belief that it is not acceptable for them to ever look or feel nervous in social situations. Other standards may emphasize never offending another person, always observing perfect manners, always being dressed just right for every occasion, or always being witty and charming. All of these expectations are perfectly admirable goals but unrealistic to expect of oneself on a regular basis. If achievement of perfection is your goal, you will frequently experience failure and feel badly about yourself. 3. Low Self~E(ficacy. Self~efficacy is the term psychologists use for self-confidence in how effective one expects to be. One type of self~efficacyrefers to the belief that you can do something successfully. Socially anxious people often have low self-efficacy, meaning that they doubt their ability to do the right thing (or to do it well) in a social interaction. They may doubt that they have adequate social skills or the ability to make small talk. Sometimes individuals with social anxiety disorder also experience a second kind of low self-efficacy known as IIlow outcome expectancies,\" This refers to the belief that even if you can perform adequately (such as being assertive and asking someone to change his or her behavior), you will still not get what you want (Le., the other person will not comply). Socially anxious individuals often expect that a situation will go poorly or that they will be rejected by the other person. As with the other dysfunctional thinking patterns, low self-efficacy beliefs such as these can become self~fulfilling. If you do not believe you can accomplish what you want, then it makes little sense to try. However, not trying to make a new friend, give a speech) or tell someone how you feel means that you never really find out what would have happened if you had reached out or spoken up. Thus you never have an opportunity to disconfirm your dysfunctional belief or discover that you are more skilled and more effective than you previously believed. How Dysfunctional Thinking Patterns Play Out in an Actual Situation We have probably all heard the expression IIseeing the world through rose-colored glasses.\" This expression describes the tendency to see people and circumstances in a positive light, even more positively than the situation warrants. People have characteristic ways of viewing the world that act like a filter. Some things get through the filter, and the person thinks about them and acts on them. Other things are blocked out. In the case of rose-colored glasses, positive aspects of people and circumstances make it through the filter. Negative information gets screened out and the person seems to ignore it. Neutral information becomes tinged with pink and is viewed positively. 33 34 Following this metaphor, we might say that people who experience severe social anxiety (and probably other forms of anxiety as well) see the world through amber-colored glasses. Like the amber of a traffic light, these glasses warn that danger could be nearby, so watch out and be prepared. Things may be fine now, but they could change at any minute. These amber glasses help the person to pay extra attention to signals that the interaction may not be going well or that the other person is forming a negative impression. In our research we have found that the filtering system is very specific. Socially anxious people pay a lot of attention to information related to social threat but pay no more attention than a nonanxious person to information about other kinds of threat. The amber glasses also filter out information that indicates non-threat, that the situation is safe, proceeding well, or that the other person is forming a favorable impression. If you ask a socially anxious person how they are performing in a conversation, for example, they almost always underestimate how well they are doing. This is because the amber glasses represent a biased view that focuses on their mistakes or imperfections (\"I stumbled over my words\"). This perspective also leads the person to ignore or disqualify anything that goes well (\"I haven\\'t made a total fool of myself because he is very easy to talk to\"). It is important to realize that these beliefs-or amber-colored filter-are dysfunctional because they provide a biased view of the situation. This serves to maintain the dysfunctional beliefs, increases the physical symptoms of anxiety, and leads to real or imagined poor performance. Dysfundional Beliefs and Increased Physiological Arousal When we are in danger, our bodies have a built-in mechanism to help us handle that danger. When the caveman or cavewoman walked outside the cave and came face to face with a saber-toothed tiger, the ones with an internal alarm system were more likely to survive. This alarm system, called the fight-or-flight response, means that when our brains identify that shape as a dangerous tiger, our bodies gear up (muscles tense, heart rate and blood pressure increase, adrenaline is released into the bloodstream) to either fight the tiger or run away quickly (flight). Although there are some situations today in which the fight-or-flight system helps us respond to danger, social situations are not among them. Social situations are not dangerous, at least not in the same way that a saber-toothed tiger was dangerous. Apounding heart is useful when facing a tiger, but not when trying to start a conversation with a stranger. Excessive physiological arousal, such as a pounding heart, can interfere in two ways. First, social interactions reqUire complicated behavior. One has to pay attention to what the other person is doing and saying, figure out what it means, make the appropriate response, and then evaluate how the other person reacts. All of the extra energy from the fight-or-flight response interferes with these behaviors because a conversation does not require the same level of energy as running or fighting. Instead, conversations require calmness and concentration. Actors and athletes often report that they perform best when they feel \"pumped up\" for a performance, meaning that they are experiencing a little bit of arousal that makes them feel focused and alert rather than lethargic. Too much anxiety, however, keeps actors from remembering their lines or athletes from sinking the gamewinning free throw. How does physiological arousal relate to dysfunctional beliefs? If you have a biased view of a situation, then you might perceive it as more dangerous or challenging than it really is. This would lead to increased arousal that may then interfere with performing well, thus incorrectly confirming the belief that the situation was too difficult for you to handle, and the expected social failure becomes a reality. However, experiencing the arousal itself can also serve to strengthen the dysfunctional beliefs. If your heart is pounding and your muscles have tensed up, then it is easy to think that the situation \"must\" be dangerous. While the inherited tendency to experience arousal in unfamiliar situations contributes to the development of dysfunctional beliefs about their dangerousness, misinterpreting a situation as threatening can lead to arousal which then serves to confirm that the situation is dangerous after alll This circular reasoning is an easy trap to fall into and can lead to more and more anXiety. Dysfunctional Beliefs and Behavior As we just saw, dysfunctional thinking can both result from and lead to physiological arousal. Perceiving social situations through the amber glasses of dysfunctional thinking patterns can also interfere with a person\\'s performance. At every moment we are bombarded by all sorts of sensory information. You see the black words on the white page, feel the pressure of the chair against your back, hear the sound of your own breathing, and so forth. Our attention system can only absorb so much information at one time, so we block out most and only concentrate on what is most relevant at a given moment. HaVing a conversation with someone or giving a speech requires a lot of attention. However, as you will remember from above, socially anxious people use up part of their attentional capacity by watching for signs of sodal threat. That means there is less capacity left to listen to what the other person is saying and to notice small nuances or gestures. We have probably all had the experience of not listening to someone because we were thinking of what to say next. It is very difficult to listen and plan to talk at the same time! To some extent the individual with social anxiety does this all of the time. It is hard to fully participate in a conversation when you are thinking about what to say next, whether the other people like you, whether their voice tone means they are angry, never knowing what to say, and hoping the conversation will be over soon because your heart is starting to pound and they might notice your blushing. Summary of the Development of Social Anxiety and Dysfunctional Beliefs Let\\'s take a moment to summarize the causes of social anxiety disorder. Social anxiety disorder seems to result from an inherited tendency to be anxious and withdrawn in new situations that then interacts with certain types of experiences 35 in life. Whether the genetic predisposition, early experiences, or traumatic experiences are more important varies from person to person. The combination of these factors leads the person to develop certain patterns of dysfunctional thinking about whether he or she has control over the outcome of social situations and whether that outcome is likely to be positive or negative. These beliefs then serve to color how future social interactions are interpreted in a way that tends to confirm the dysfunctional beliefs. The beliefs may interfere with performance or lead the person to avoid the situation, thus preventing opportunities to overcome the anxiety and check out whether the beliefs are true. Frequently Asked Questions When we share this explanation for social anxiety disorder with people, there are some questions that frequently come up as people try to apply it to their own situation. We would like to address some of the most common of these questions now. 1. Isn\\'t my social anxiety caused by a chemical imbalance in my brain? Very often people with social anxiety disorder have read or been told that the disorder is caused by a \"chemical imbalance\" in their brain or nervous system. Usually people take this to mean that being socially anxious is like having an underactive thyroid gland. The body simply is not prodUcing the right chemicals in the right amount and the solution is to change which chemicals are produced by taking medication. This view is only partially correct, however. Research on the brain processes of people with social anxiety disorder has not consistently found differences between individuals with and without the disorder. Yet our thoughts and emotions start in our brain, so there must be biochemical processes underlying social anxiety. The chemical imbalance theory is too simplistic because it ignores the fact that our experiences in the world greatly affect the complex chemical systems and neural pathways in the brain. Recent research with brain imaging demonstrates that the brains of individuals change following successful treatment for emotional disorders, whether the person was treated with medication or with psychological treatments such as the one described in this manual. We recognize the significance of biological processes in fully understanding social anxiety disorder. In fact, many people take medication for the disorder and experience substantial benefit. That is why we have included a chapter on medication in this manual. However, scientific research suggests that biological explanations for social anXiety disorder and treatment with medication are not the whole story for most people. 2. I\\'m just an introvert or shy. Isn\\'t that OK? Of course it is OK to be an introvert or shy if it is OK with you. Lots of people prefer a more solitary life and lead rich, fulfilling lives that emphasize purSUits they do on their own. Many are creative, talented pe~ple wh() choose their friends carefully. 36 However, you are the best judge of whether or not you are happy being an introvert. If being shy keeps you from doing what you want to do, if you are lonely because you lack close friendships, if you want to be with people but it makes you too nervous and uncomfortable, then being an introvert is not OK for you. The treatment discussed in this workbook can help you change. It is unlikely that you will suddenly become an extrovert who is the life of every party, but there is probably a middle ground where you can be quite comfortable. 3. This explanation doesn\\'t fit me. No one else in my family has social anxiety and I was fine until I got divorced/experienced a traumatic event/had children/etc. Our explanation of social anxiety disorder assumes that experiences early in life are important in the development of the disorder for two reasons. First, research suggests that individuals with social anxiety disorder say their parents treated them in particular ways that seem to be related to the development of the problem. Second, most people report that they noticed they were socially anxious their whole life or that it started by the time they were in high school: \\'It is relatively uncommon for social anxiety disorder to start when someone is in their 20s or older. When the disorder seems to start after a significant event in adulthood such as a divorce or relocation, we have often found that there were hints of the problem before but that the person had developed a way to manage it. For example, it is not unusual to see someone seeking treatment for social anxiety after being widowed or divorced. They discover that they had relied on their spouse in social situations and now lack the confidence to enter social situations on their own, let alone re-enter the dating scene. If you are one of the few people whodeveloped social anxiety later in life, this workbook may still be useful to you. It may be important to examine what was going on in your life when the social anxiety developed to see how it changed your beliefs about yourself and the world around you. - Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy as Treatment for Social Anxiety What Is Involved in Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy We have discussed the three components of social anxiety: cognitive, physiological, and behavioraL Each of these will need to be addressed in treatment. Cognitive changes will involve changing dysfunctional beliefs and expectations to a more functional view of yourself, other people, and the world. Excessive physiological arousal in feared situations will need to be reduced substantially. Behavioral changes need to include both improving performance in social situations (if poor performance is a problem) and eliminating avoidance of feared situations and people. The treatment itself has three components which address each of these aspects of social anxiety. The three components of treatment are systematic graduated exposure, cognitive restructuring, and homework assignments. Each of these will be discussed in turn. 37 38 Systematic Graduated Exposure Folk wisdom tells us that if you want to overcome the fear of something} you must ultimately face it head on. The same is true for overcoming social anxiety. However} as you well know} this is easier said than done. Psychologists use the word lJexposureJJ to refer to facing one}s fears in a therapeutic fashion-in other words} doing the things that make you anxious. Your ultimate goal is to feel more comfortable in the situations that now cause fear. Eventually you will have to enter those situations} some of which you may have avoided for a long time. There are lots of ways to face your fears. We like to use the analogy of learning to swim. You can probably learn to swim by jumping repeatedly into the deep end of the pool and struggling to the side. After repeatedly being very scared and swallowing a lot of water} you would eventually learn how to float and then paddle and kick to move through the water. However} it would not be much fun. On the other hand} you can learn to swim by starting gradually} in the shallow end of the pool. First} you just get your feet wet and get used to being in the water. Then you learn to put your face in the water} and later how to float. Over time you develop sufficient skills to be able to jump into the deep end. You will probably still be anxious when jumping off the diving board for the first time} but you have built up your confidence over repeated practices in easier situations. We believe in doing exposure the same way. If someone is anxious about talking with a co-worker of the opposite sex} we believe that it makes sense to work up to it with a series of conversations with people who evoke less anxiety. One of the unique aspects of this treatment program is that you start exposure within the treatment session. If you are not currently in therapy} note that one of the advantages of a structured therapy situation is to provide a safe environment within which to confront difficulties that you have been struggling with alone. By first role playing (acting out) interactions in a therapy session} you have an opportunity to try new things in a controlled environment. You can get feedback on how well you are doing} and the situations can be easier because they can be predictable. For example} if you are anxious about being assertive} you can first practice in the therapy session in which you and your therapist can control how the other person will respond. Another advantage of in-session exposures is that you can practice coping with something that you are worried about but is unlikely or unpredictable in real life. For example} we once worked with someone who always worried that his note cards would blow away during a speech. He feared that he would be embarrassed as he tried to gather them up and then would be unable to continue} as his notes would be out of order. Through careful placement of a fan in the therapy room} we were able to create this fairly unusual situation. Once he had lived through the situation once} he realized that he would just need to take a few minutes to re-order his notes} make a humorous comment about what had happened} and then go on. Why is exposure helpful in overcoming social anxiety? It works in at least three ways. First} as you stay in the situation} your phy~ical symptoms will habituate. Although it may seem like your shaking knees and pounding heart will never stop} this is not the case. Habituation is a normal bodily process in which physiological arousal levels off and then decreases over time. Habituation also occurs with repeated practice in a situation so that over time you become less anxious and the anxiety goes away faster. In real life, people often feel so anxious that they do not stay in a situation long enough to find out that their heart will stop pounding and the nausea will go away. Once you have experienced habituation a few times, you can learn to trust that it will happen, which helps you feel more relaxed before you even enter the feared situation. Second, exposure works because you are practicing exactly what you need to do. Often people have avoided the things they fear for so long that they have had little practice in what to say or do. Exposure allows you to practice the behavioral skills that are involved in asking for a date, making a speech, being assertive, or making conversation in a safe environment. Third, exposure works because it gives you an opportunity to test the reality basis of your dysfunctional beliefs. If you have a perfectionist belief that you must not look at all anxious, then exposure will help you determine how anxious you actually look by giving you feedback from others. Exposure will help you see how others respond if your anxiety does show a little (or a lotI). Cognitive Restructuring Cognitive restructuring is a set of procedures that allow you to directly attack your dysfunctional thinking by systematically analyZing the things you are saying to yourself when anxious. Cognitive restructuring does not mean that you take out the bad thoughts and replace them with good thoughts. It is not just blindly thinking positive thoughts, either. Cognitive restructuring techniques teach you to question your beliefs, assumptions, and expectations to see if they really make sense or are helpful. Obviously cognitive restructuring targets the cognitive component of social anxiety, but you might be surprised to learn that it helps with the physiological and behavioral components as well. Remember that physiological arousal is a normal response to a dangerous situation. Through cognitive restructuring you can learn to make a more realistic assessment of the danger in a situation and, consequently, you should have fewer physical symptoms. Cognitive restructuring helps the behavioral component of social anxiety in two ways. First, as your thinking becomes less dysfunctional, you will have more mental capacity to focus on the situation, rather than focusing so much on your anxious reaction to it. Second, changing your dysfunctional beliefs helps decrease your avoidance which, in tum, gives you an opportunity to have more positive experiences. As you evaluate your experiences more realistically, you will eventually change the dysfunctional beliefs for good. Exercises described in this workbook are designed to help you with cognitive restructuring. If you are currently in therapy with a person trained in this approach, your therapist will help you with this process. 39 40 Homework Assignments The third component of treatment is homework. It would be fine if you went through treatment practicing the exposures in session, learning the cognitive restructuring skills, and feeling more and more confident in the role plays. However, it is essential that you make changes in your real life outside of therapy as well. Homework is designed to make that happen. Over the course of treatment, . your therapist will ask you to do certain things dUring the week. At first, the homework assignments will involve thinking about something or keeping track of how you are thinking or feeling. Later, after you have completed some of your in-session exposures, you will start to try some exposures on your own in real situations. Again, these are graduated so that you start with easier situations and work up to harder ones. Thus, homework is the bridge between therapy sessions and the changes you want to make in your life. There are three important things you should know about homework. First, it is negotiated with your therapist. It is your therapist\\'s job to encourage you to try new things, but it is your job to be honest about what you can and will do for homework. Once you agree to something, you need to follow through, so be sure to let your therapist know how you are feeling about a particular homework assignment. Remember that by expressing your discomfort assertively to your therapist, you are helping yourself overcome your fears of assertiveness or talking with authority figures. Second, you do not have to do the homework perfectly to be successful, you just need to make a good effort. If your homework is to start three conversations dUring the week, then you just need to start the conversation with someone and exchange a few words. You do not need to have a heart-to-heart discussion or start a lifelong friendship! Third, homework assignments for exposure will include cognitive restructuring exercises as welL It is essential that you complete this part Qf the assignment to get the full benefit of the experience. This way any anxiety you feel during the exposure will truly be \"invested in a calmer future,\" just as our slogan says. Summary of the Rationale for Treatment As you can see, this is a fully integrated treatment program in which you systematically begin to face your fears, using cognitive restructuring techniques to help control your social anxiety and change the dysfunctional beliefs that underlie it. By working gradually through the program, you can build success upon success as you tackle more and more difficult situations. At each step you are transferring your progress to the real world through homework and identifying and addressing the dysfunctional beliefs that keep you anxious. Homework This is the end of the introductory educational material. The next chapter introduces the first steps of the treatment program. This is a good time to stop and think about how you feel about starting this program. After all, making major changes in your life can be both exciting and frightening. It is likely that you have been struggling with social anxiety for many years. If so, it may be hard to be confident that you can become more comfortable making speeches, having conversations, dating, or being in other situations you fear. On the other hand, you may be excited that you finally understand what has been going on and you are optimistic about change. Sometimes finding out that someone else has had similar problems can be a huge relief. In the last three chapters we have shared what the scientific literature and our combined years of experience have taught us about social anxiety. During the week, we would like you to review this material and think about whether it makes sense to you. Use the worksheet in Figure 3.2 entitled \"Worksheet for Reactions to Starting This Treatment Program\" to help you think through your reactions. Make a rating on the 1-10 scale for each question, then jot down a few notes to explain your ratings.

Figure3~2-,; ... 42 Plotting the Road Map for Our Journey: Gathering Information on the Situations That Are Difficult for You In the previous chapters, you learned about the cognitive, behavioral, and physiological symptoms that you experience in situations that cause you anxiety. We talked about the factors that contribute to social anxiety disorder, including heredity, things you learn growing up, and experiences you might have in life. We also talked about dysfunctional thinking patterns that can develop as a person grows up and how those patterns can interfere with being comfortable and competent in social situations. The previous chapter ended with a preview of the three components of treatment: graduated exposure to feared situations, cognitive restructuring, and homework assignments. For homework, you were asked to think about how confident you feel about this treatment program. If your ratings indicate that you are fairly confident, that is terrific. You are ready to move on to the next step. Afew doubts are normal, but if you are having significant doubts, then you should discuss these with your therapist before moving on to the next step in the program. You might find it helpful to go back and re-read the sections in Chapters 1 to 3 that address the topiCS about which you have doubts. Chapter 2 focused on the symptoms you may feel when you are socially anxious. In this chapter we are going to start to discuss the situations that make you anxious. Although everyone who experiences social anxiety fears being viewed negatively by others or performing poorly in social situations, the situations that evoke those fears vary considerably from one person to the next. Some people become anxious in only a few situations, but others become anxious almost every time they might have to talk with another person. Before you and your therapist can figure out which situations to tackle first, it is important to understand what makes a situation easier or harder for you. Is it easier or harder if you know the person with whom you will have a conversation? Are groups of people easier or harder than one-on-one situations? To answer these questions, you will be constructing a Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy. This is a rank-ordered list of situations in which you experience anxiety. 43 Building a Fear and Avoidance ~lierarchy There are four steps in constructing a Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy: (1) brainstorming; (2) rank ordering the situations; (3) discovering what makes a situation easier or harder; and (4) making ratings of the situations. You will work through each of these steps with your therapist. We have included an example so you can see how the whole process works before you tackle it for yourself. Step 1: Brainstorming The first step in constructing a Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy is to make a list of situations that you might want to include. The best way to do this is to \"brainstormII by listing as many situations that make you anxious as you can. Figure 4.1 presents a sample hierarchy brainstorming that Marlene completed. Marlene is an elementary school teacher in her mid-40s. You can see on her list that there are many situations at work that make her anxious but there are also some in her personal life that cause her difficulty. Because she is married, dating is not an issue, but she still gets anxious meeting new people, such as her husband\\'s co-workers. You can see that Marlene listed both general categories such as \"talking with students\\' parentsII and very specific situations such as \"meeting her husband\\'s ex-girlfriend at the high school reunion. 1I It is OK to have a mixture like this. As you and your therapist brainstorm together using the form in Figure 4.2, \"Brainstorming for Your Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy,lI be sure to include a wide range of situations. Not all of them will make it onto the final hierarchy, but brainstorming helps assure that you do not miss any important situations. You will want to list at least eight to 10 situations. Do not worry about putting the list in any order at this point. Be sure to include some that you find very difficult as well as others that cause only moderate anxiety and mild anxiety. If you are having difficulty thinking of enough situations, then consider some situations that people with social anxiety commonly say cause them anxiety. Perhaps some of these apply to you: speaking in front of a group large vs. small group familiar vs. unfamiliar people being the center of attention casual conversations friend vs. acquaintance vs. stranger meeting someone new man vs. woman eating or drinking in front of others 44 Brainstorming for Your Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy Rank Situation Talkin9 with stuaentsJparents Meetin9 huspanaJs eX-9irl!riena at hi9h sc..hool reunion Makin9 small talk with huspanaJs c..o-woYkers Makin9 small talk with huspanaJs poss JValkin9 into a meetin9 late when everyone is alreaay seatea Returnin9 somethin9 to a store Havin9 to tell parents their c..hi/a is !ailin9 Eatin9 ainner at someoneJs house that I ao not know well Speakin9 In !ront of! a 9roup of! aaults (kias are O!() Figure4~~; Sample Form for Marlene 45 Rank Brainstorming for Your Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy Situation 46 - COllyrt~ht <Cl 2000 by Graywlnd Publications Incorporated writing or typing while being observed being assertive answering the telephone talking with an authority figure talking with a very attractive person job interviews ,.. taking communion at church unexpectedly seeing an acquaintance giving or receiving a compliment saying \"no\" to someone attending meetings for work with teachers for a community organization You can see that there are variations on some situations, such as different types of conversations, that might cause you more or less anxiety. For example, Marlene finds talking with students\\' parents fairly difficult but she becomes much more anxious if she has to tell the parent that his or her child is failing in school. Maybe you are not very anxious having a casual conversation with someone you know fairly well, but if you have to talk with someone new, then you become much more nervous. By looking over the list of situations provided and considering variations on some of the situations you initially list, you can probably include eight to 10 situations on your worksheet. If you have a lot more, that is fine. Your therapist will help make sure that you have an appropriate range of situations to work on. Step 2: Rank Ordering the Situations After you and your therapist have finalized your brainstorming list, it will be time to rank order the situations with 1 being the most difficult, the situation that causes you the most anxiety and that you would most like to avoid. You will count down so that the highest number is assigned to the situation that causes you the least anXiety on the list. You can see the rank ordering that Marlene did in Figure 4.3. \"Having to tell parents their child is failing\" was the most difficult situation, and \"making small talk with husband\\'s co-workers\" was the least difficult situation. 41 Brainstorming for Your Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy Rank Situation 7 Talkin9 wirh sruaenrs\\' parenrs 2 Meerin9 htiSpana\\'s eX-9irlfriena ar h/9h sc::.hool reunion 10 Makin9 sl1lall ralk wirh htiSpana\\'s c::.o-workers 4 Makin9 sl1lall ralk wirh htiSpana\\'s poss .5 walkin9 inro a l1Ieerin9 fare When everyone is alreaay searea !J l?erurnin9 sOl1lerhin9 ro a srore 1 Havin9 ro rell parenrs rhe/r c::.hila is laiJin9 q Earin9 ainner ar sOl1leone\\'s house rhar I ao nor know well 51\\'~dkhtlfJ il1 Irt!\\'\"ltF C7Jfl d 9r\"t:I1\\' 01 dZ;tilrs (kids dr~ 01<) 3 Speakin9 in fronr 01 rhe c::.on9re9arion ar c::.hurc::.h (t; Speakin9 in fronr 01 rhe Parenr Teac::.her Assoc::.iarion Figu~4.3; Sample Form for Marlene 48 As she did her rank ordering, Marlene had trouble ranking\"speaking in front of a group of adults\" because different variations of that situation caused her different amounts of distress. By dividing the situation into two separate entries on her hierarchy-\"Speaking in front of the congregation at church\" and \"Speaking in front of the Parent Teacher Association meeting\" -Marlene was able to complete the ranking. Step 3: Discovering the Dimensions That Make a Situation Easier or Harder for You Next Marlene will look over her Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy to see if she can notice any patterns in what makes a situation more or less anxiety-provoking for her. As we look at Marlene\\'s list, we can see that who she is making small talk with makes a difference. She is much more comfortable with her husband\\'s co-workers than she is with his boss. As Marlene thinks about it, she realizes that if the other person is an authority figure, it makes the situation more difficult for her. Similarly, she is fairly comfortable speaking in front of a group about work-related topics or as part of her job. She has no anxiety when she is in front of the classroom; that situation does not even appear on her hierarchy. Parent-Teacher Association meetings make her somewhat nervous but everything is related to work so she is confident she knows what she is talking about. However, if she is asked to make an announcement in church or to do some of the readings, she becomes qUite anxious. Finally, Marlene finds telling people something they do not want to hear-for example that their child is failing in school-makes her more anxious than just talking about neutral topics. Thus, we can see that Marlene has three dimensions that make a situation easier or harder for her: status of the person (her husband\\'s boss is an authority figure), whether the situation is workrelated, and the nature of the topic (sharing bad news is harder). You and your therapist will go over your list and define the dimensions that are important for you. Your therapist will ask if there are patterns in what makes a situation easier or harder. Here are some questions that might help you find the dimensions that are relevant for you. Does it make any difference if ... the person is a man or a woman? the person is married or single? the person is higher or lower status than you? the person is younger or older? the person is someone you will or will not see again? the person is or is not very attractive? the person has or does not have a lot more education than you? the situation is one-on-one or involves more than one person? the people are friends, acquaintances, or strangers? 49 the situation is structured (organized around an activity) or unstructured? the situation is formal (like a wedding reception) or casual (like a weekend barbecue)? you will be standing or sitting? the event will last for a short or long time? the event is spontaneous or you have a chance to prepare? The dimensions that are import~t for you may be qUite different from Marlene\\'s. In factI what makes a situation difficult for one person may make it easy for another or it may be totally unimportant to them. Why is it important to identify these dimensions? Because by understanding them, both you and your therapist will be better able to predict how much anxiety you will experience in a new situation that is not on your hierarchy. Later, when you work together to design exposures, it is helpful to be able to make these predictions about situations. Remember the analogy that graduated exposure is like learning to swim by starting out in the shallow end of the pool and working up to the deep end? In a senseI these dimensions define what parts of the lipoolll are more shallow or deep for you. Step 4: Rating Each Situation for Fear It Evokes and the Likelihood You Will Avoid It The final step in constructing your hierarchy will be to make some ratings about each situation. You will be making two ratings: how anxious the situation makes you (Fear Rating) and how likely you are to avoid it (Avoidance Rating). We will discuss each in detail. SUDS: Subjedive Units of Discomfort Scale The scale we will be using to make fear ratings is called the Subjective Units of Discomfort Scale or SUDS for short. The SUDS was developed by two of the founding fathers of behavior therapy-joseph Wolpe and Arnold Lazarus-over 30 years ago. It has stood the test of time because it is simple and easy to use. The SUDS is a 0- to lOa-point scale with higher numbers indicating more anxiety/greater discomfort. Here\\'s what the scale looks like: o 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 no anxiety, mild anxiety, moderate anxiety, severe anxiety, very severe anxiety, calm. relaxed alert. able to cope some trouble concentrating thoughts of leaving worst ever experienced 50 We have put descriptive labels at 0,25,50, 75, and 100. As you can see, the scale measures \"subjectiveII anxiety just as the name suggests, meaning that it is a measure of how you are feeling. How anxious you feel mayor may not match how anxious you look to other people or whether or not you are able to cope with the anxiety and remain in the situation. The SUDS rating is just about feelings. Let\\'s take a moment to talk about various points on the SUDS. SUDS =O. Azero SUDS rating means zero discomfort. You mayor may not be happy or excited but if you are not feeling at all anxious, then your SUDS rating is O. Can you think of a recent situation in which your SUDS rating was 0, a time when you felt calm and relaxed? Maybe you felt excited, but not anxious. Record that situation in the box. Situation When My SUDS Rating Was 0 SUDS = 25. A SUDS rating of 25 indicates that you are feeling mild anxiety with which you can easily cope. In fact, it might mean that you are simply very alert with a little \"edgeII of nervousness. Performers and athletes often report this type of feeling just before going on stage or onto the playing field. It is more \"hyped Up\" than anyone probably wants to feel all the time, but a little anxiety can help a person focus on the need to perform. Nevertheless, in casual sodal situations, it is probably a little more anxiety than most people who do not have problems with sodal anxiety are likely to experience. Think of a recent soda! or performance situation when your SUDS rating would have been 25. Situation When My SUDS Rating Was 25 SUDS = 50. By the time a person feels a SUDS rating of 50, the anxiety is definitely bothersome and uncomfortable. There is some difficulty concentrating on what is going on around you, and the feelings of anxiety are distracting. However, at 50 you still feel that you can probably cope and are not yet thinking about leaving or running out of the room. Think of a recent time when your SUDS rating would have been SO in a social situation. Situation When My SUDS Rating Was 50 S1 SUDS =75. At a SUDS rating of 75, the person is feeling extremely uncomfortable and is having difficulty coping with the anxious feelings. It is very hard to concentrate and all you can think about is how bad the anxiety feels. If you are haVing thoughts of running away, then your rating has probably reached 75. Can you think of a situation that you were in recently that fits this description? Situation When My SUDS Rating Was 75 SUDS =100. Simply defined, a SUDS rating of 100 is the worst anXiety you have ever experienced or can imagine experiencing. Because the scale is subjective, the feelings that are given a rating of 100 vary from person to person. Some people feel very panicky or have a sense that something terrible is going to happen. Think about the worst anxiety you have ever experienced in a situation related to social anxiety. Now, can you imagine anything worse? Whatever you are imagining is your personal definition of a SUDS rating of 100. Be sure to think about a social or performance situation because the SUDS ratings will be used to track your social anxiety. You may have experienced a traumatic or stressful situation in which you were more frightened but that does not tell us much about your social anXiety. Situation When My SUDS Rating Was 100 Think about what your SUDS rating is right now. It is OK to use any number between 0 and 100 (e.g., 23, 57, 92), including 0 and 100. Some people just use the \"tens\" (10, 20, 30, etc.), but you should use the scale however it works best for you. The most important thing is that you communicate to yourself and to your therapist how much anxiety you are feeling so you can track your anxiety as it goes up and down across time. My SUDS Rating Right Now: __ Avoidance Ratings Remember that the list of situations you developed is called a Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy? The second rating for each situation, therefore, will be a rating of avoidance. As we discussed above, avoidance is part of the behavioral component of social anxiety disorder and refers to whether or not you refrain from doing the things that make you anxious. We usually think of avoidance . , \\' 52 as all or nothing (either you attend a party or not) and that is mostly what we will be considering here. However, you might engage in more subtle avoidance by attending the party but talking only with people you already know and with whom you feel fairly comfortable. You do not initiate conversation with anyone who makes you feel challenged or uncomfortable. We will talk about how to rate that type of avoidance. As with SUDS, we will rate avoidance on a 0 to 100 scale with a higher number indicating greater avoidance. Here is the Avoidance Scale: never avoid avoid once in awhile avoid sometimes usually avoid always avoid As with the SUDS ratings, you can use any number between and including 0 and 100. If you virtually never enter a situation because of your anxiety, then the avoidance rating would be 100. If you usually enter the situation then your rating for that situation would be low-about 10-20. However, it is possible to engage in more subtle avoidance even if you usually try to enter the situation. Let\\'s go back to the example of attending a party. You may attend the party but only talk with the one person you know. You might actively avoid haVing to talk with anyone else, even if someone tries to engage you in conversation. In that case, you could honestly say that you do not avoid parties because you do go to them. Your avoidance rating for \"attending parties\" would be low, maybe even O. However, the avoidance rating for \"talking with strangers at parties\" would be high, in this case maybe 95. This rating would not be qUite 100 because you at least put yourself in a position where strangers might talk with you rather than avoiding the opportunity altogether. Sometimes people say that they do not avoid a situation because they do not have the freedom to do so, especially regarding situations related to work or something essential to daily living such as grocery shopping. We have found, however, that it is almost always true that the person could avoid the situation, although the consequences might be extreme. For example, a manager who is anxious about giving a report at a managerial meeting may feel that he cannot avoid the situation because he will lose his job. That may be true, but many people quit jobs (or never even apply in the first place) because they are anxious about giVing such reports, even if there are significant financial consequences. Thus, the manager\\'s avoidance rating for giving the report would be low, despite very high anxiety. Now that you have a good understanding of the Fear and Avoidance Ratings, refer to the Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy form in Figure 4.4. Fill in the situations you rank ordered with the most difficult on top, then make a photocopy of the form. Then fill in the SUDS and Avoidance Rating for each situation on one of the forms, saving the second form without any ratings for evaluating your progress in Chapter 13. Let\\'s look at Marlene\\'s hierarchy and her ratings in Figure 4.5. As we do, we can learn quite a bit about her social anxiety. Both of the top two situations 53 Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy Subjective Units of Discomfort Scale (SUDS) o 5 W \" m 8 ~ \" ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ n ~ e \" \" ~ no anxiety, mild anxiety, moderate anxiety, severe anxiety, very severe anxiety, calm, relaxed alert, able to cope some trouble concentrating thoughts of leaving worst ever experienced Avoidance Rating o 5 W \" D 8 ~ \" ~ ~ ~ ~ \" ~ n ~ U ~ \" ~ never avoid avoid once in awhile avoid sometimes usually avoid always avoid Situation ~ Avoidance #1 most difficult situation is #2 most difficult situation is #3 most difficult situation is #4 most difficult situation is #5 most difficult situation is #6 most difficult situation is #7 most difficult situation is #8 most difficult situation is #9 most difficult situation is #10 most difficult situation is Figu,..4A., . ~ \" \\' \\'\\\\ . 54 Copyrlght e 2000 by Graywtnd Publlcatlons Incorporated Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy Subjective Units of Discomfort Scale (SUDS) o 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 no anxiety, mild anxiety, moderate anxiety, severe anxiety, very severe anxiety, calm, relaxed alert, able to cope some trouble concentrating thoughts of leaving worst ever experienced Avoidance Rating o 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 never avoid avoid once in awhile avoid sometimes usually avoid always avoid Situation SUDS Avoidance #1 most difficult situation is fellin9 parenfs fheir c.-hiltJt is lailin9 /00 25 #2 most difficult situation is meefin9 hus/JantJt\\'s eX-9ir!lrientJt af Hl9h sc.-hool reunion /00 /00 #3 most difficult situation is speakin9 in Ironf 01 fhe c.-on9re9afion af c.-hurc.-h ~o ~o #4 most difficult situation is makin9 small falk wifh hus/JantJt\\'s /Joss 80 40 #5 most difficult situation is walkin9 info a meefin9 lafe where everyo~e Is alreatJty seafetJt 75 ~o #6 most difficult situation is speakln9 in Ironf 01 fhe farenf-Teac.-her Assoc.-Iafion 75 50 #7 most difficult situation is falkln9 wlfh sfutJtenfs\\' parenfs 40 5 #8 most difficult situation is refurnln9 somefHln9 fo a sfore 40 /00 #9 most difficult situation is eafin9 tJtlnner af someoneIS house fhaf 1 tJto nof know well :;5 50 #10 most difficult situation is makln9 sl1lall falk wlfh hus/JantJt\\'s c..o-workers 25 /5 Figure 4.5. Sample Form for Marlene 55 make her extremely anxious (SUDS = 100). But note that she is much more likely to avoid going to the high school reunion than telling parents their child is failing her class. Because speaking with parents is an important part of her job and she feels it is harmful to the child if she puts off telling parents the bad news too long, Marlene usually does speak with the parents. She gave herself an avoidance rating of 25 because she feels that she occasionally puts off scheduling the meeting for a few days. On the other hand, she finds it easier to avoid meeting her husband\\'s ex-girlfriend at the high school reunion. In fact, her husband is qUite angry about her refusal to attend the reunion next month, but so far she does not plan to go. Looking further down Marlene\\'s hierarchy we can see that she has a fairly low avoidance rating for another situation that provokes qUite a lot of anxiety, \"making small talk with husband\\'s boss.\" In that situation, she is more worried about making a bad impression if she seems to avoid the boss than about anything she might say or do during the conversation. On the other hand, two situations that evoke less anxiety are almost always avoided. Situation #5, \"walking into a meeting late where everyone is already seated,\" she avoids by being extremely careful to be on time. Situation #8 is easy to avoid because she ~ither gets her husband to make the return or just keeps the item even though she is dissatisfied. Final Words on Your Fear and Avoidance tlierarchy If you are currently in therapy, your therapist will spend quite a bit of time working out the details of your Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy with you. Whether or not you are in therapy it is helpful to become familiar with the material in this chapter and to start thinking about the situations you will want to include on your hierarchy. The Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy serves two important roles in a cognitive-behavioral treatment program. First, as noted above, developing the hierarchy helps you and your therapist understand which dimensions make a situation easier or harder for you. This information can help your therapist develop exposures in the session and for homework that are challenging but not overwhelming. Second, in a few weeks we will ask you to look at your hierarchy again and make new Fear and Avoidance Ratings. This is a good way to track your progress so that you and your therapist can gauge how well the program is working for you. Homework Learning to Monitor Your Anxiety One of the first steps in gaining control of social anxiety is to understand more precisely when and where you get anxious in your daily life. If you go to see a therapist each week, you can (and probably will) describe some of the times you became anxious since your last session. However, there has been a great deal of 56 scientific research suggesting that what clients report to their therapists is not very accurate. People\\'s memories tend to be related to their current mood. If you are haVing a bad day when you come to see your therapist, you are more likely to remember all of the anxiety you had dUring the week. Similarly, if you are feeling more relaxed and confident when you see your therapist, you will probably remember the week as more calm, without as many anxiety episodes. In order to overcome the effects of current mood on memory, we will be asking you to make some ratings of your anxiety each day. Then when you meet with your therapist, you can review the ratings and be confident that they are accurate. Figure 4.6 provides a form to be used to monitor your anxiety during the week, called \"Self-Monitoring Form.\" Make several copies of this form for use in the coming weeks. As you can see in the completed example (Figure 4.7), you will be making three types of ratings. The first is a rating of your average anxiety for the day using the SUDS scale. It should reflect your general sense of how calm/relaxed or anxious/uptight you typically felt during that day and should not focus only on social anxiety. The second rating is an average daily rating of depression. This rating should reflect the extent to which you generally felt down, blue, sad, or depressed throughout the day. Although it may seem odd to be keeping track of your depression during a treatment program for social anxiety, many people with social anxiety also experience difficulties with depression. We have found that most people feel less depressed as they start to make progress toward overcoming their social anxiety. However, if you get too depressed, your therapist may want to talk with you about separate treatment for your depression. The last rating involves keeping track of your SUDS in one or two situations from your Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy. After completing your hierarchy, you and your therapist should select one or two situations that you would like to monitor. It is best to pick situations that occur fairly often and cause quite a bit of anxiety. You will be monitoring these situations throughout treatment, so avoid picking something that will only occur once or twice. You should complete the self-monitoring form at the end of the day, perhaps after dinner or at bedtime. It is easier to get in the habit if you make the ratings at about the same time each day. Leave the form in a place where you are likely to see it, maybe taped to your bathroom mirror or on your bedside table. Bring the completed form to session each week to review with your therapist. We have two charts (Figure 4.8 and Figure 4.9) for you to track your progress from week to week. Compute the average for each column on the self-monitoring form and mark the average on the charts. Examples of completed charts appear in Figures 4.10 and 4.11. Why Do the Self-Monitoring? Doing self-monitoring every day like this is a bit of a hassle. However, it is also a very important part of the treatment program. As you and your therapist review the self-monitoring each week, you willieam more about the situations that cause 57 Self-Monitoring Form Instrudions: At the end of each day, record the average anxiety and average depression you experienced throughout the day and your peak anxiety in each of the situations you are monitoring.

Sample Completed Weekly Summary of Self-Monitoring of Average Peak Anxiety for Two Situations you difficulties. This will help your therapist tailor the treatment to fit your particular circumstances. Reviewing the self-monitoring each week also keeps track of your progress through the program. You might notice that your anxiety goes up initially as you stop avoiding situations. It is normal and expected that facing your fears will cause anxiety at first. However, over time you should see progress on the charts. 64 1. The situations that evoke social anxiety are the same for everyone. 2. Understanding the dimensions of situations that you find anxiety-provoking will help you predict how much anxiety you might experience in a new situation that you did not include in your hierarchy. 3. You can use avoidance ratings on the Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy to rate your subjective distress in a situation. 4. When constructing your Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy, if an avoidance rating for an anxiety-provoking situation is low, then the anxiety rating will always be low. Answers to Self-Assessment questions can be found in Appendix A. T F T F T F T F Identifying the Thoughts That Cause Anxiety Reviewing Your Self-Monitoring Homework By the time you start this chapter, you should have been completing the selfmonitoring form for a week. As you review the completed form and plot your average ratings for the first week on the graphs, think about what you have learned about your anxiety. What was going on the days that it was the highest and the lowest? Did the two situations you picked to monitor occur dUring the week? If not, consider whether you are avoiding those situations. In the coming weeks, you will start to reduce that avoidance, so your anxiety may increase for awhile. Later it should decrease as you gain confidence facing your fears. If you had trouble completing the self-monitoring for this week and you are in therapy, discuss the difficulties with your therapist. Uyou are not in therapy you may consider consulting a therapist at this time. Perhaps you can pick a better time or place to complete the form. Self-monitoring is extremely important. If you continue to have problems getting it done, then we recommend you stop moving forward in the treatment program and work only on the monitoring for awhile. If you really cannot remember or find time for the monitoring, then maybe this is not the right time to start the treatment program. This program takes a lot of energy and work outside of the session. Be sure you can make the commitment of time and energy before proceeding. The first four chapters laid the basic groundwork for the treatment program that starts in this chapter. In this chapter and the next, you will learn about how what you think influences how anxious you feel and how to change what you are thinking so you can feel less anxious. 65 The Importance of Thoughts Consider two unmarried men, Jerry and Rich, who both moved to town recently for a new job. Neither of them knows anyone and both want to develop friendships and possibly meet a woman to date. As Jerry arrives home from work one evening, he sees an attractive woman about his age getting her mail, apparently arriving home herself. Jerry has seen this woman around and believes that she lives next door to him. He has never spoken with her but would like to get acquainted, so he goes over to her and introduces himself, adding that he has just moved in. She looks up from her mail briefly and says hello. As she continues to sort through her mail, he thinks the following thoughts: She doesn\\'t want to talk with me. I\\'m bothering her. She thinks I\\'m weird or something. I\\'m so inept that I made a bad first impression just saying hello. Suddenly feeling anxious and uncomfortable, Jerry then says, \"See you around,\" and picks up his own mail. He walks into his apartment feeling a little angry (\"She wouldn\\'t even talk to me\") and depressed (\"1\\'11 never meet anyone\"). Now let\\'s look at Rich\\'s experience in the same situation. Just like Jerry, Rich arrives home from work and sees an attractive woman about his age getting her mail. Rich has also seen this woman around and believes that she lives next door to him. He goes over to her and introduces himself, telling her that he just moved in. She, too, looks up from her mail briefly and says hello. As she continues to sort through her mail, he thinks the following thoughts: She must be expecting something important in the mail. Maybe she is tired from work. I\\'ll have to try a little harder. She is pretty dressed up. I\\'ll have to ask her about where she works. She might be a little hesitant to talk with a man she does not know. Rich then makes a comment about the weather and asks if it is typical for this time of year. The woman answers and then asks where he moved from. After talking more about what they each do for work, Rich invites her out for coffee. Although Jerry and Rich started out in identical situations, the outcomes were very different. Why? Because the thoughts they had about the woman\\'s initial lack of friendliness differed dramatically. In other words, how they interpreted her behavior influenced their subsequent actions and, ultimately, whether they had further conversation. It is not events themselves, but our interpretation of events, that causes anxiety. 66 The Relationship Between Events, Thoughts, and Feelings Albert Ellis, the world-renowned psychotherapist and creator of Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT), talks about the relationship between events, thoughts, and feelings in terms of the ABC\\'s. A= Activating Event (what happened-the circumstances) B=Belief (what a person thinks about the activating event) C= Consequences (feelings and behavior) In this case, the activating event was the woman\\'s lack of response to Jerry\\'s or Rich\\'s introduction. Jerry\\'s belief was that she did not want to continue the conversation. Rich\\'s belief was that she probably would want to continue the conversation but was temporarily distracted or tired. These differing beliefs led to very different consequences. Jerry continued to be alone and felt angry and depressed while Rich was excited about the beginning of a possible friendship. Again, it is not the events themselves that make aperson anxious but how one interprets them. Imagine that a stranger is pointing a gun at you. If you are like most people, you will feel frightened because you believe you could get hurt. However, assume that you know the gun is a water pistol. How would you feel now when the stranger points it at you? Probably not very frightened, because you have no reason to believe you are in danger. Again, it is not the gun that frightens us, but our beliefs about the harm the gun could cause. The same is true of social anXiety. People with social anxiety become anxious not because of the situation itself, but because of what they believe about the situation, the other person, or themselves. Let\\'s look at another example to see how this might work. Jose is a 38-year-old man who works in a manufacturing firm, and he is attending a party for a newly hired group of managers at the firm. One of the new managers is standing at the refreshment table. He has not met her yet but has heard that she is making a lot of positive changes. He has been thinking that he might try to get a transfer to be in her department. As Jose starts to walk over and speak with the manager, he has the following thoughts: I\\'m getting nervous just thinking about going to talk to her. She\\'ll think I\\'m too aggressive if I talk to her about the changes she has been making. She\\'ll think there\\'s something wrong with me if she sees how nervous I am. I\\'m going to make a fool of myself. I must make a good first impression or , will never get the job I want. 67 These thoughts lead to the following physical symptoms: heart beating faster breathing faster-feels like he can\\'t get his breath butterflies in his stomach muscles tensing up As Jose gets closer to talking with the manager, he notices his mind is going blank~ and he does not know what to say. He considers detouring to the other end of the table, as if he were only going to refill his glass, but decides to at least say hello and introduce himself. He stumbles over his words as he says his name and has to repeat it for her. After sharing a few words about the party and the food, he excuses himself and slips away. If someone had been watching him, they would have observed the following: walking up to her stumbling over his words blushing cutting the conversation short Before and during the conversation, Jose felt quite anxious. However, as he walked away from the woman, he experienced a number of other feelings as well, and became very upset with himself. Some of the feelings he noticed were: guilt and shame over not being able to handle a simple conversation sadness and anger that he missed an opportunity to get to know the person better foolishness and stupidity at being so incompetent Not surprisingly, Jose perceived this situation as a failure and felt very poorly about himself. His self-esteem went even lower than usual. Exploring Your Thoughts Now imagine yourself at this party and follow through the same analysis that Jose completed. If you do not get anxious at parties, imagine it to be another gathering such as a meeting or reception. You look across the room and see someone you would like to meet standing near the refreshment table. It could be someone that you are interested in dating, someone you admire professionally who could advance your career, or someone famous like a politician, author, or athlete. Pick someone who would cause you at least a little social anxiety if you were to talk with him or her. Imagine that the person is standing alone, eating some of the 68 snacks. Now imagine that you have decided to take this opportunity to go over and talk with the person. As you imagine this, what are you thinking? Write your thoughts in the first section of the form entitled \"Learning About Your Reactions\" (Figure 5.1). There are a couple of phrases to help get you started. As you consider the thoughts you recorded above, what physiological symptoms of anxiety might you experience? List these physical symptoms in Section 2 of the form. As you get closer to the person, with these thoughts running through your head and the physical symptoms running through your body, what would you do? This is the behavioral component of social anxiety. In other words, if someone were observing you, what would they see happening? Record your behaviors in Section 3 of the Learning About Your Reactions form. Now let\\'s consider how the thoughts you listed above would make you feel. Assume that you either had some difficulty in the conversation or you avoided talking with the person altogether. What emotions might you be feeling? Record them in Section 4 of the form. There are a few examples to get you started. As you can see from this exercise, the thoughts that you had as you imagined walking over to the person influenced almost every aspect of the way the situation turned out, including: whether you experienced certain physiological symptoms whether you talked with the person or not if you did talk with him or her, how well you did what emotions you felt and how you felt about yourself How Other People Might React To Our Thoughts Looking back at the thoughts Jose had before approaching the new manager, we can see that he was thinking about how anxious he felt, he anticipated the conversation would turn out poorly, he assumed she would prefer not to talk with him or would think poorly of him, and he placed tremendous importance on making a good first impression. If Jose\\'s thoughts could magically appear in balloons over his head as if he were a cartoon character, what do you think the manager would say if she could read them? Do you agree with Jose that she would be difficult to talk to or uninterested in what he has to say? Or do you think she would be sympathetic? Do you think she would feel bad that she was making him so nervous? Maybe she would like to talk about the changes she has been making because she has put a lot of effort into 69 Learning About Your Reactions 1.

Do you think she might say that talking with the bigwigs might be good for her career but that she is always on the lookout for good employees as well? Now go back and look at the thoughts you wrote down and consider what the person you wanted to talk with would say about your thoughts. Do you think the person would be sympathetic? Do you think he or she would try to make you feel more comfortable? Might he or she tell you not to worry so much? Most people with social anxiety we have worked with say that they would probably be supportive if they knew that the other person was anxious. Usually people say they would try to make the person feel more at ease. Occasionally we have had clients say that the other person would think they were odd or mentally ill for having such crazy thoughts. Although it is possible that some people would react negatively, it has been our experience that most people try to be supportive and encouraging if they know how nervous a person is. That is probably because social anxiety is a part of everyone\\'s life. Everyone can remember feeling nervous at some time, so it is easier to be empathic than if the feelings of social anxiety were totally foreign to them. When Jose worried that the manager would think he was too aggressive or that he would make a fool of himself, he did not question those thoughts. Like most people with social anxiety, he accepted his thoughts as if they were already established facts. Since he had never met her, what reason did he have to believe that she would think he was too aggressive? Is it not just as likely that she would be impressed by his knowledge of what she had done and be excited about talking with someone about how the changes were working out? Look back over the thoughts you wrote down. Did you question them or did you just assume that they were true? We will return to the notion of questioning your thoughts a little later. Automatic Thoughts Aaron T. Beck, the founder of Cognitive Therapy, was one of the first to write extensively about how negative thoughts can make us feel bad. His first work was with people who were suffering from severe depression. Dr. Beck noticed that depressed patients seemed to have a lot of negative, hopeless thoughts such as, /ll\\'m a failure,\" /lI\\'m never going to get better/\\' and /lNothing ever goes right for me. II In fact, the patients regularly shared these thoughts with him. They seemed to come into their minds spontaneously, and the more they thought like this, the worse they felt. In his landmark book entitled Cognitive Therapy for Depression, published in 1979 with his colleagues Drs. John Rush, Brian Shaw, and Gary Emery, Dr. Beck called these negative thoughts automatic thoughts or ATs for short. He defined automatic thoughts as negative or irrational thoughts about oneself, the world, and the future. Since then, Dr. Beck and many other therapists and 71 researchers have confirmed that people with anxiety also have an abundance of ATs. The good news is that as people learn to change their ATs, they feel less anxious and depressed. Learning to change the ATs that make you feel anxious is not simply a matter of taking out the bad thoughts and replacing them with good ones. ATs are very persistent and just trying not to have them will not make them go away. Trying to suppress negative thoughts in order to think positively may actually make the ATs worse! Daniel Wegner, a social psychologist, did an experiment in which he asked people to try not to think about a white bear. No one had been thinking about a white bear to begin with, but after they were instructed to not think about it, something surprising happened. All they could think about were white bears! Many experiments since then have concluded that trying not to think about something has just the opposite effect. So what you will be learning in this program is a series of strategies to attack your ATs directly rather than attempting to suppress them and think positively. The first step is learning to identify your ATs. Identifying ATs and the Emotions They Cause Let\\'s look at an example of the ATs that one of our clients reported haVing in a situation that made her quite anxious. Susan was trying to finish her degree and had enrolled in an evening class in public speaking. It was nearly the last class she needed to finish her program but she had registered and withdrawn three times. Susan was terrified of giving the five required speeches in front of the class. However, this semester she was determined to finish the class. The first assignment was a 3-minute speech about a person you admire. About a week before she was scheduled to speak, Susan started to get nervous. Susan knew that if she was feeling anxious, she must be haVing some ATs. Let\\'s look at what she discovered she was thinking. I don\\'t know who to talk about. I\\'m getting too nervous. I\\'ll look like a complete idiot. I\\'ll get up there and not be able to say anything. Looking at these thoughts, is it any wonder that Susan was feeling anxious and worried? Here is what she imagined would happen: The day of the speech would come and she would still not have picked a topic. She would go up to the front of the class without being prepared. She would stand there for the required 3 minutes mostly in silence, feeling very anxious and uncomfortable, and everyone in the audience would conclude that she had very little intelligence. If that is really what was going to happen, then it makes sense that she felt anxious. Anyone would 72 dread having such an unpleasant experience! But how likely is it that her speech would turn out the way she feared? Let\\'s go back and look at some of the questions Susan asked herself about her ATs. I don\\'t know who to talk about. Do I have any ideas about who I could talk about? Does it really matter who I choose? I\\'m getting too nervous. How nervous is too nervous? What does that mean? Is it any surprise that I am nervous about this speech? Will anyone else be nervous? I\\'ll look like a complete idiot. What do I mean by IIcomplete idiot\"? How much do I think the anxiety will show to others? I\\'ll get up there and not be able to say anything. How likely is it that I will not say anything for 3 minutes? What will happen ifI can\\'t fill the whole 3 minutes? As you can see, Susan is asking herself questions that may help her get a different perspective on some of the thoughts. Try to think of other questions she could ask herself about these thoughts. Do not worry about answering the questions at this point. To give you some idea about how the cognitive restructuring component of treatment will work, let\\'s assume that Susan is a few sessions ahead of this point in the treatment program and has already learned how to challenge her ATs. After she has identified her ATs, Susan will try to question and challenge them. We will call this a conversation between \"Anxious Susan\" and \"Coping Susan.II Here is what she might say to herself: 73 74 Aulo.s S.un: I don\\'t know who to talk about. Coping S.un: Is it really true that I have no ideas about who I could discuss? I really admire my sister. She was so brave when she had breast cancer. I could talk about that. Or, I could talk about someone famous, maybe a president or an actor. It probably does not matter who I talk about anyway because we are not graded on our choice. Aulo.s s.un: I\\'m getting too nervous. Coping S.un: I have been avoiding this class for a long time, so shouldn\\'t I expect to be nervous? Anyway, what does too nervous mean? I just have to try to prepare my speech, work on my ATs, and get through it. It will probably be easier once I have done it the first time. If it is really horrible, I can always withdraw and try again later. Aule.s S.un: I\\'ll get up there and not be able to say anything. Coping s.un: Do I really believe that I won\\'t be able to say anything for the whole three minutes? Certainly, I\\'ll be able to say something. I can plan ahead and write out what I want to say. Even though we are not supposed to read the speech, I can take notes up there to look at in case my mind goes blank. Maybe I\\'ll take a glass of water as well so that I can take a sip if I get stuck and need to fill some time. The most important thing is just to get through it since I\\'ve been avoiding it so long. How do you think Susan would feel after haVing a \"rational talk\" with herself? Usually taking a moment to step back from the ATs, question them, and look at the thoughts more rationally can help reduce anxiety. This is the purpose of the cognitive restructuring portion of the treatment. Cognitive restructuring is not a magic cure for anxiety. It rarely eliminates all anxious feelings. However, it can help you reduce anxiety enough that you are able to cope and get through the difficult situation. These two components of treatment-repeated challenging of ATs combined with repeated exposure to the feared situation-work together to reduce anxiety over time. Identifying Your Own ATs and the Emotions They Cause Now it is time for you to practice identifying your own automatic thoughts and the emotions they cause. Anyone who decides to make changes in his or her life, such as starting a program to overcome social anxiety, probably has some thoughts about making those changes. Although many of the thoughts may be positive and optimistic, there are likely to be doubts as well. After all, if change were easy, you would have done it already! Let\\'s take a look at some ATs you might have about starting this treatment program. Take a moment to think about what we have covered up to now. Think about what you have learned about social anxiety disorder and what you have learned about yourself from doing the exercises. Think about the three components of treatment-therapeutic exposure, cognitive restructuring, and homework. Do you have any doubts or fears about anything you have read? Do you have any doubts about whether the treatment will work for you? About whether you will be able to make the changes you want to make? Write down any thoughts you are having on the form in Figure 5.2 entitled\"Automatic Thoughts About Starting Treatment for Social Anxiety.\" Do not worry about grammar or spelling. Do not edit them or try to make them sound better. Just be honest. Try to identify at least three or four thoughts. Earlier we defined ATs as \"negative or irrational thoughts about oneself, the world, and the future.\" How many of the thoughts you wrote down meet this definition? The thoughts may not seem irrational or illogical and they may not be. Some ATs make sense, but they are negative and/or not helpful to think about. If you are having difficulty identifying ATs, ask yourself the following questions: What doubts do I have about whether this treatment program will work forme? What worries do I have about the exposures? What doubts do I have that I will be able to make real, lasting change? What doubts do I have that my therapist will really be able to understand and help me? (if in therapy) What doubts do I still have that this therapy program could really help me? (if not in therapy) ATs often begin with \"rm ...,\" \"rm going to ...,}} or \"He/she will think ....}} Also look for thoughts that have a lot of emotion in them or contain emotional words (e.g., nervous, anxious, worried, hopeless) or emotionally laden labels (e.g., stupid, incompetent, idiot). 75 D ashamed D hateful Automatic Thoughts About Starting Treatment for Social Anxiety As I think about starting this treatment program, I am thinking about ... 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8.

There are a number of thoughts that come up repeatedly. We have listed those thoughtsl along with some more rational responses to them. Againl we include the rational responses to preview what you will be learning to do for yourself starting next week. This treatment won~t work for me because my sodal anxiety is too severe. What evidencel other than my own pessimismI do I have to think this is true? Do I have evidence that this treatment might possibly be helpful? This treatment has been used with many people around the world. At least some of them were probably as bad off as I ami maybe worse. Besidesl if my problems are so seriousI then it means I need to try even harder to make changes. Jill just do the best I can and hope it works. I\\'ve been anxious too long. There is no way I can change. It is true that I have had problems with social anxiety since I was a childl but does that mean I cannot change? Earlier I read that many of the people in the authors\\' research had social anxiety disorder most of their livesl yet most of them got better. I won\\'t be able to do the exposures because I\\'m too anxious. I am feeling very worried about doing the exposuresl but does that mean I wonlt be able to do them when the time comes? My therapist can help me start slowly and pick easier situations to begin with. Aisol by the time the exposures startl I will have had practice with cognitive restructuring. If I work very hard on cognitive restructuringl that should help me control my anxiety. I don\\'t have any thoughts when I am anxious, so the cognitive restructuring won\\'t work forme. Againl what evidence do I have that this is the case? Although I am having difficulty figuring out what my thoughts are right nowl I have not really had much chance to practice yet. The authors say that other people who could not recall their thoughts at first learned to do so later. Jill keep trying and see how it goes. If I continue to have troublel rll talk with my therapist about it. It will be too hard to talk with my therapist about what I am really thinking. It is true that I might have some thoughts that are embarrassing or seem silly. I might have thoughts that are painful to talk about. Howeverl does this mean I canlt do it? Everything I say to my therapist is private and confidential. Those thoughts that I am worried about might be the most important ones to discuss. I do not have to do it all at oncel though. I can take my time. 77 Role playing the exposures in session sounds silly. That won\\'t work for me. How can I know if the role plays will work for me until I try them? Maybe I am thinking role plays are silly because I am anxious about doing them. This treatment program has helped a lot of people. There is no reason to think that I am that different from them. I\\'ll just try and see how it goes. Besides, there are always the exposures in the homework even if the in-session exposures are not ideal for me. I\\'ve been in therapy lots oftimes and nothing has ever worked for me. Unfortunately, there are no guarantees that this treatment program will work either. However, what good do I do for myself by focusing on this point? There are a lot of scientific studies showing that it is helpful for many people. I have never done anything exactly like this in therapy. My therapist would not be recommending it if it were not appropriate for me. I know that I won\\'t make progress on my social anxiety if I do not try it so my best option is to work hard and see how it goes. Homework In addition to continuing the self-monitoring of your average daily anxiety and depression, it is time to practice keeping track of the ATs you have in a situation that make you anxious during the week. Using the form entitled \"Monitoring Your Automatic Thoughts\"(Figure 5.3), write down a brief description of a situation you encounter that makes you anxious. Afew words are sufficient. Then write down the thoughts you are having. Do not worry about spelling or grammar. Try to write down the thoughts exactly as you think them without editing to make them seem nicer or more sophisticated. If you are thinking, \"I\\'m a damn moron!\" write that down. Do not change it to \"I was thinking that I was not very smart. II Try to come up with at least five thoughts. Then, after you have recorded the thoughts, indicate what emotion(s) you were feeling in the situation. If the feeling you had is not listed, describe it in the space proVided. When To Do Your Homework It is always best to fill out the form as close to the time you had the thoughts as possible. If you find yourself anxiously anticipating an event, then take a few minutes to write down your thoughts before the event even happens. You can always add some thoughts from the actual event later. Sometimes it is not reasonable to take out the paper and write down your thoughts right at the time. Try to fill out the form as soon afterwards as you can, certainly before you go to bed that night. It is especially important to record your thoughts as soon after the situation as possible if you are the sort of person who plays a situation over and over again in your mind, because doing so often changes the nature of the thoughts. We want you to capture your thoughts and feelings as they occurred to you in the situation. 78 Monitoring Your Automatic Thoughts 1. Situation (Briefly describe the anxiety-provoking situation.) 2.

You can either use something that happened in the past or something that may be coming up. Try to imagine it as vividly as possible. Then record the situation (indicating that you imagined it), your thoughts, and the accompanying emotions. See Figure 5.4 for an example of a form completed by John, who describes his automatic thoughts about calling Amanda and inviting her to lunch. ,S~lf-AssessmeJit 1.

Answers to Self-Assessment questions can be found in Appendix A. 81  Tools to Challenge Your Automatic Thoughts In the last chapter you learned how to identify the automatic thoughts that you have when you get anxious. Some people are very aware of their thoughts and do not have any trouble writing them down. Other people find that their ATs slip by so quickly that it takes some practice to learn to catch them. If you are having trouble identifying your ATs, do not despair! Like most things in life, it gets easier with practice. In this chapter, we will cover the remaining steps in cognitive restructuring. These steps include analyzing the ATs for logical errors, questioning whether the ATs are really true, and developing more rational, helpful statements to make to ourselves. By the end of the chapter, you should have an entire arsenal of weapons with which to attack those anxiety-producing ATs that can ruin your life. Defining Thinking Errors In the last chapter we defined ATs as negative or irrational thoughts about oneself, the world, and the future. What do we mean by irrational? Irrational means that there is something about the AT that does not make any sense when you really step back and think about it, something that is illogical in some way. Anumber of psychologists and psychiatrists (Dr. A.T. Beck and his colleagues, Dr. jacqueline Persons and Dr. judith Beck, among others) have written about the types of logical errors that they have found in the thinking of their anxious and depressed clients. Over the years, we have found their ideas to be very helpful for people working to overcome sodal anxiety. We would like to share some of these ideas with you. The logical errors in ATs are called Thinking Errors. We will talk about a number of different types of Thinking Errors as outlined by Dr. judith Beck in her 1995 book Cognitive Therapy: Basics and Beyond (published by Guilford Press and adapted with 83 84 permission of the author and publisher) and based on the work of Dr. A.T. Beck. As you read through the following sections, be sure to keep two points in mind: 1. Many ATs may contain more than one Thinking Error, depending upon which aspect of the thought you emphasize. 2. Recognizing lots of Thinking Errors in your own thoughts does not mean that your social anxiety is more severe or that you will not be able to benefit from this treatment program. We will review each of the Thinking Errors in detail here. Figure 6.1 contains a summary of the Thinking Errors that will be a good reference for you to use as you make efforts to recognize these errors in your thinking in everyday life. Make a copy of it and keep it where you can review it frequently. All-or-Nothing Thinking (Also called black-and-white, polarized, or dichotomous thinking): You view a situation in only two categories instead of on a continuum. All-or-Nothing Thinking means that something is seen as having only two distinct categories. Things are seen as black or as white, without any shades of gray. One of the categories represents goodness, success, intelligence, or attractiveness. The other category represents badness, failure, stupidity, or ugliness. Usually the good category is very small and hard to get into. The bad category, on the other hand, is large and easy to fall into. That means that if one is using All-or-Nothing Thinking to reflect on success and failure, it will be much easier to fail than succeed. There is no such thing as doing OK or partially succeeding, because everything is black and white. Let\\'s look at some examples. Consider the woman who had the AT: \"Men will only date me if I am beautiful.\" In her case, \"beautiful\" meant looking like a movie star or a model. Thus, the category of being beautiful was very small and the opposite, \"ugly\" or \"unattractive,\" included most of the women on the planet! Needless to say, this AT made her very anxious when talking with men because she always expected to be rejected at any moment. Although she was rather attractive, she did not look as though she had just stepped off the cover of a magazine. Another example of All-or-Nothing Thinking is the businessman who became very anxious at the picnic sponsored by his wife\\'s department at the university where she worked. His wife was a professor, and nearly everyone at the picnic had more education than he did. He had the AT \"I\\'ll say something stupid and embarrass both of us.\" For him, stupid things to say included everything that most people talk about all of the time-weather, sports, current events, movies, and so forth. He wanted to say only \"brilliant\" things, so he said nothing at all. If an AT implies that only perfect is good enough, then it probably contains some All-or-Nothing Thinking. If you find yourself not wanting to do something because you fear you will not do it well enough, consider whether you are thinking only in terms of success or failure rather than the important gray areas of partial success or doing well but not perfectly. Fortune Telling You predict that something negative is going to happen in the future, as if you were gazing into a crystal ball. There are two thinking errors that fall under the general heading of Anticipating Negative Outcomes. The first is Fortune Telling. Few of us believe that the fortune teller at the carnival can look into her crystal ball and accurately predict whom we will marry or how many children we will have. Yet it is very common for our clients with social anxiety to look into the future and make very confident predictions such as \"I\\'ll get anxious if I go to the party,\" \"She won\\'t go out with me,\" or \"I won\\'t have anything to say.\" Because they are already convinced that the situation will turn out badly, they often avoid going altogether, giving themselves \"evidence\" that the situation was indeed too difficult for them to handle. Even if the person does not avoid the situation, then these negative predictions can become self-fulfilling prophecies. For example, if people expect to be turned down when they ask a person out on a date, it is unlikely they will put their best foot forward when offering the invitation. Typically when people make negative predictions about what is going to happen in a situation that makes them anxious, they have failed to consider whether there is any evidence to support their prediction. There may be good reason to believe that the situation will turn out just fine. In other cases, people believe that their negative predictions are firmly rooted in the evidence of past experience (e.g., \"1 always get anxious in this situation\"). However, they ignore the fact that every circumstance is slightly different. Even small changes can affect what happens in a social situation. This may be especially true for you as you make progress in this program. You are becoming a different person who may act and think differently than you did in the past. Therefore, the \"evidence\" of past experience may no longer apply. Whenever you find yourself automatically predicting that a situation will turn out badly, beware the Fortune Telling error! Catastrophizing You tell yourself the very worst is happening or is going to happen, without considering other possibilities that may be more likely and/or less negative. The second type of Anticipating Negative Outcomes is Catastrophizing, jumping to the conclusion that something is (or will turn out to be) absolutely terrible without any evidence that it is really that bad. Most often people catastrophize about the future, predicting that an upcoming event will turn out terribly, and then they act as if the prediction is true. \"1\\'11 never get a job!\" is a good example of a Catastrophizing AT that our clients often report after suffering through a 85 86 difficult job interview. Other examples include \"I\\'ll never find another person to love me\" after a relationship ends and \"I\\'ll never get promoted\" after appearing nervous with a supervisor. These Catastrophizing ATs have in common that they each suggest extremely negative consequences if things do not go well in the situation. Sometimes Catastrophizing ATs can seem silly when said aloud. If someone gets turned down for one job, the next step is not usually to move the entire family into a cardboard box in an alley. However, these ATs can lead to very powerful feelings of anxiety, depression, and hopelessness. Sometimes our clients are so ashamed and afraid of the catastrophe they fear that they hardly admit it to themselves. We often find that the feared catastrophe comes in the form of a clear image of some awful outcome, like being home alone and lonely night after night, lying in your deathbed all alone, or seeing your children huddled in a cold alley. Once clients face these horrible images and express their fears aloud, the images almost always becomes less frightening. Disqualifying or Discounting the Positive You unreasonably tell yourself that your positive experiences, deeds, or qualities do not count. This Thinking Error is one of the most common logical errors that we have seen in our work with individuals with social anxiety. As you will see in a later chapter, Disqualifying the Positive, which involves ignoring or rejecting positive experiences or events, can undermine your successes and interfere with your progress in this program. Here are some examples of Disqualifying the Positive ATs: It went OK because she was easy to talk to. I didn\\'t get very anxious. I must have just been having a good day. I don\\'t know why I was so worried about it. It wasn\\'t any big deal. What do all of these thoughts have in common? An event that the person was anxious about beforehand went well, but the person refuses to take any credit for the success. Instead, \"credit\" goes to the other person, some vague unknown force that makes us have \"good days\" and \"bad days,\" or our own stupidity for thinking something would be difficult when it was really easy all along. Disqualifying the Positive is the perfect strategy for maintaining a belief that you will not be able to handle a situation you fear-you have nothing to do with making it go well so there is no reason to be more confident next time! Emotional Reasoning You think something must be true because you \"feel\" (actually, believe) it so strongly, ignoring or discounting evidence to the contrary. Emotions, especially feelings of anxiety, are often very strong. These feelings are truly hard to ignore. The strength of your feelings can mean that you come to believe that they represent the only reality of the situation-\"I\\'m feeling very anxious so this conversation must be going badly. II This is Emotional Reasoning. In this example, it is true that the person is feeling very anxious. However, the conversation could be going just fine. In fact, the anxiety may not be noticeable to the other person. Another example of Emotional Reasoning is the man who felt very anxious at formal parties such as wedding receptions. He had worked all his life as a carpenter, and he felt foolish and out of place being all dressed up and having to talk with people he did not know well. His AT was \"I feel so foolish, I must look really foolish.\" In reality, he looked quite handsome in a suit and tie, and other people were often as worried about making small talk with him as he was with them! Labeling You put a fixed, global label on yourself or others without considering that the evidence might more reasonably lead to a less disastrous conclusion. The Thinking Error of Labeling involves summarizing your feelings about yourself, a situation, or another person with a negative label. Most often people with social anxiety apply negative labels to themselves, not other people. These labels cause problems because they shift your attention from something specific that you might be unhappy with (something you said or did) to a total negative judgement about your personality or character. This is the difference between saying to yourself that you made some mistakes on the project versus calling yourself an incompetent oaf. Not only does the label make you feel bad, it can make you feel stuck and hopeless about changing anything. Over the years our clients have come up with some colorful labels for themselves including: foolish incompetent jerk space cadet idiot inadequate stupid boring loser hopeless mentally ill loony defective dweeb disgusting As you might guess, the same people who labeled themselves with these emotionally loaded words would often be described by others who know them well as bright, competent, interesting, fun, and attractive. When people with social anxiety apply negative labels to others, it is often because they are angry at them. In most cases, they have good reason to be angry. However, sometimes they are angry because a person has put them in a position in which they feel uncomfortable because of their anXiety. Consider the college student who described a professor as a \"total jerkll and an \"incompetent teacherII 87 88 for insisting that the student complete a required classroom presentation. The student, who was very anxious about speaking in front of a group, felt trapped between his fear of making the presentation and his concern about failing the class. Labeling the professor was not helpful because it shifted his attention from trying to cope with his anxiety to just being angry at the professor. MentaI Filter (Also called selective abstraction): You pay undue attention to one negative detail instead of seeing the whole picture. The Thinking Error called Mental Filter means that you focus all of your attention on one negative detail and it colors your entire view of yourself, another person, or the situation. The negative detail can be a symptom of anxiety like a voice quaver, hand tremor, or blush. Or it can be something that happened, like spilling some food or a drink, a single argument with someone you care about, or losing your train of thought. By focusing on the negative detail, it is difficult to see the bigger picture, which is likely to contain many positive aspects as well. Mental Filter is similar to Disqualifying the Positive, in which positive experiences are discounted. In Mental Filter, positive experiences are overwhelmed by the focus on the negative detail. As an example of Mental Filter, consider the lecturer who becomes very anxious after seeing one person yawn in an audience of 7S people. The lecturer\\'s AT is \"That person is yawning so my speech must be boring.\" By focusing all of the attention on the one sleepy person and filtering out the other 74, the lecturer loses the big picture. Yes, the person did yawn. Maybe she was bored by the speech-or maybe she just did not get enough sleep the night before. However, there is no reason to pay more attention to her than to the other 74 who did not yawn. Mind Reading You believe you know what others are thinking, failing to consider other, more likely, possibilities, and you make no effort to check it out. Mind Reading is exactly what the name implies-you assume that someone is reacting poorly to you as if you could read his or her thoughts. Because you are sure about what the other person thinks about you, you act as if it were true without checking it out. That often keeps you from finding out that, like most people, you are not a very talented mind reader and the person was actually thinking neutral or positive thoughts about you or was thinking about something else altogether. Consider the woman who believed that her boss thought she was incompetent because he did not recommend her for a new position that opened up in her firm. In reality her boss thought she could easily get the position, but was not aware that she wanted to be recommended. Or the man who became very anxious when he thought a sales clerk assumed he must be mentally ill because his hand shook a little as he wrote out his check. In realityl she thought he must be feeling impatient because there had been a long line at the checkout stand. Overgeneralization You make a sweeping negative conclusion that goes far beyond the current situation. Overgeneralization means that a person gives too much emphasis to one event or experiencel usually a negative one. This bad thing happenedl so I know that is what will always happen.. Overgeneralization often leads to not trying some thing again that did not go as well as the person would have liked last time. Overgeneralization often means not giving yourself-or someone else-a second chance. Lefs look at an example. Consider the man who was about halfway through this treatment program when his therapist suggested that it might be time to try having lunch with his co-workers. He had become very anxious in the situation before treatment and had been going to his car to eat lunch alone ever since. When asked by his therapist why he did not want to attempt this assignmentl he reported the following Over generalization AT: \"I know I wonlt be able to do it because I got very anxious last time I tried to eat with them. II By basing his conclusion about his inability to join his co-workers for lunch on one experiencel he ignored all of the skills he had learned in therapy and all of his more recent successes in other situations. \"Should\" and \"Must\" Statements (Also called imperatives): You have a precisel fixed idea of how you or others should behave and you overestimate how bad it is that these expectations are not met. Should Statements are usually the easiest Thinking Errors to identify. Just look for ATs that contain the words /lshould/ \"must/ IIought/ or \\'Ihave to./1 It is helpful to think of Should Statements as the rules we have about the way we need to live our lives. Having such rules is not necessarily bad. IIYou should not steal\" is a rule that nearly everyone would agree is a good ideal not an irrational belief. The Should Statements that are Thinking Errors are rules that are extreme or perfectionistici such as III should always be perfect/ III should never get anxious/ /II should always be in control,ll We have found that the Should Statements that socially anxious people use often create extremely high standards. In facti these standards are so high that virtually no one could live up to them. Even highly paid TV anchor people on the evening news shows could not live up to the standards that some socially anxious people set for themselvesl like /II should never stumble over my wordsll or III should always speak clearly and fluently.\" 89 Although you will probably find that your Should Statements are directed at yourself, they can also be directed at other people. If you are feeling angry or hostile towards someone, consider whether a Should Statement is involved. Maybe you have some \"rules\" about how the other person should act. One of our clients was very upset with her husband and revealed the following Should Statement when discussing upcoming holiday plans: \"He shouldn\\'t ask me to spend Christmas with his family. He knows how anxious I get around them.\" Maladaptive Thoughts Consider the following thoughts: I\\'ve never asked anyone out on a date before. I\\'m feeling uncomfortable. It\\'s not fair that I have such severe anxiety. Working on overcoming my anxiety is hard. What do all of these thoughts have in common? They are not illogical. In fact, they are probably true, or they are value judgments which are neither true nor false. Since we defined ATs as \"negative, illogical thoughts,\" these examples are not, strictly speaking, ATs. You may find that you have some thoughts like these that do not seem to fit into any of the Thinking Error categories. It turns out that a few thoughts that cause anxiety do not contain logical errors. However, if you dwell on them, they will make you feel more anxious. These thoughts also may make you perform less well in whatever you are doing. Dr. Jacqueline Persons calls these \"maladaptive thoughts\" rather than ATs. Fortunately, the strategies we use to challenge ATs also work for maladaptive thoughts. Asummary of the Thinking Errors appears in Figure 6.1. Finding the Logical Errors in Your Automatic Thoughts Before we look at the thoughts that you recorded about a time you became anxious in the past week (last week\\'s homework assignment), let\\'s look at Beth\\'s thoughts as she gets ready to go for an interview for a job she really wants: I must make a good first impression or they won\\'t hire me. They are going to think I don\\'t have enough experience. I\\'ll never find another job as perfect as this one would be. When she considered these ATs, Beth felt anxious and hopeless about getting the job. 90 List of Thinking Errors All-or-Nothing Thinking (also called black-and-white, polarized, or dichotomous thinking): You view a situation in only two categories instead of on a continuum. Anticipating Negative Outcomes: You expect that something negative has happened or is going to happen. Two types of thinking errors fall into this category: - Fortune Telling: You predict that something negative is going to happen in the future, as if you were gazing into a crystal ball. - Catastrophizing: You tell yourself that the very worst is happening or is going to happen, without considering other possibilities that may be more likely and/or less negative. Disqualifying or Discounting the Positive: You unreasonably tell yourself that positive experiences, deeds, or qualities do not count. Emotional Reasoning: You think something must be true because you \"feel\" (actually, believe) it so strongly, ignoring or discounting evidence to the contrary. Labeling: You put a fixed, global label on yourself or others without considering that the evidence might more reasonably lead to a less disastrous conclusion. Mental Filter (also called selective abstraction): You pay undue attention to one negative detail instead of seeing the whole picture. Mind Reading: You believe you know what others are thinking, failing to consider other, more likely, possibilities, and you make no effort to check it out. Overgeneralization: You make a sweeping negative conclusion that goes far beyond the current situation. \"Should\" and \"Must\" Statements (also called imperatives): You have a precise, fixed idea of how you or others should behave and you overestimate how bad it is that these expectations are not met. Maladaptive Thoughts: Problematic thoughts that do not contain logical thinking errors. These thoughts may be true. However, dwelling on them makes you feel more anxious and may interfere with your performance. ! Figu~6;1, Note. Adapted with permission from Judith S. Beck (1995), Cognitive Therapy: Basics and Beyond, Guilford Press, Figure 8.2, p. 119. 91 92 Look over the List of Thinking Errors and see how you would classify each thought. Remember, thoughts can fall into more than one category. For right now, do not worry about whether you think the thought is probably true. Just see which Thinking Error{s) might describe the AT. Lefs see if you found the same Thinking Errors that we found. L \"I must make agood first impression or they won\\'t hire me.\" This thought contains several Thinking Errors. It could fall into the Should Statement category. UI must...\" is a way of battering oneself with rigid requirements or rules. There is no room for flexibility. Beth feels she has to make a good first impression or she would not get the job. This thought also has the flavor of All-or-Nothing Thinking in that everything depends on the first impression. Either Beth makes a good first impression and gets the job or she makes a bad first impression and does not get the job. This thought, like all ATs that fall in the All-or-Nothing category, ignores any possibilities between the two extremes. There are many first impressions that can be made besides ugood\" and ubad.\" For example, maybe Beth could make only a moderately good first impression and still get the job. Beth probably also believes that there are many ways to make a bad first impression but only one or two ways to make a good one. Finally, Beth is doing some Fortune Telling. She is looking into her crystal ball and seeing what is going to happen in the future. Although it probably is true that she is more likely to be offered the job if she makes a positive first impression, there is no way to predict that for sure. Alot of factors go into a hiring decision, and the first impression on an interview is only one of them. 2. \\'They are going to think I don\\'t have enough experience.\" \"They are going to think\" or UThey think\" are always good clues that an AT contains the Mind Reading error. Beth has no way of knowing what the interviewers are thinking. They could have a variety of opinions about her level of experience. The interviewers could think that Beth has plenty of experience. Or they could think that she does not have very much experience but she could go through some training. If they think she only has a little experience, they might be pleased that they will not have to pay her as much at first as someone with more. In fact, the different interviewers may hold many opinions and disagree amongst themselves about her experience. If Beth does have quite a bit of experience for this particular job, then this AT is an example of Disqualifying the Positive. Beth could be downplaying her accomplishments rather than recognizing that her experience makes her very appropriate (or even overqualified) for the position. Once again, this thought contains some aspects of the Fortune Telling error in that Beth is predicting what is going to happen. You will notice that many ATs that you have in anticipation of an event that makes you anxious will contain Fortune Telling. It is easy to fall into the trap of thinking about what will happen as if it were an established fact. If the thought is making you anxious, then like Beth, you are probably predicting something bad is going to happen even though you do not actually know what will occur. 3. \"JIll never find another job as perfect as this one would be.II This is a good example of Catastrophizing and All-or-Nothing Thinking all rolled into one thought. The word \"never\" is often a good clue for Catastrophizing. Never having a particular opportunity again means you are anticipating the worst without considering other possible outcomes. Beth is emphasiZing that this is the one possibility in a lifetime for a great job. If she misses this one, there will never be another chance. Certainly there are once-in-a-lifetime opportunities such as being an Olympic athlete, being chosen to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court, or being the first person to set foot on the surface of the moon. Most events in our lives do not offer such unique opportunities. Finally, this AT contains some All-or-Nothing Thinking. Although this may be an excellent job for Beth, it is unlikely that every single aspect of the job would be wonderful. By describing the job as \"perfect,\" Beth is forming an extremely positive opinion that may cause Beth problems for two reasons. First, it is unlikely to be true. In fact, until Beth has been in the job for awhile, she will not have enough information to know whether it has any negative aspects. Second, describing the job as \"perfect\" leads to Catastrophic thinking as discussed above in that all other jobs become \"second best.\" As you can see, there are often several ways to look at an automatic thought. At first it is helpful to try and find several Thinking Errors in each thought. This gives you practice in learning to think about your ATs in a more objective way. Over time most people start to learn which Thinking Errors are the most common for them. If Beth monitored and categorized her thoughts in this way over many situations, she would likely discover that certain errors appear in her thinking on a regular basis. Looking over Beth\\'s thoughts, it appears that Fortune Telling and All-or-Nothing Thinking were the most common for this situation. Over time Beth might learn that, if she is anxious, she is likely to engage in Fortune Telling or All-or-Nothing Thinking. Then she could quickly identify the ATs that were making her anxious and challenge them using the strategies that we will cover later in this chapter. Now, let\\'s have you practice identifying the Thinking Errors in your own thoughts. Identifying the Thinking Errors in Your Homework ATs Recording your ATs during an anxiety-provoking situation during the last week gave you an opportunity to practice the first skill of cognitive restructuringidentifying ATs. This assignment also gave us a list of ATs to use for practice in identifying Thinking Errors. Take out the \"Monitoring Your Automatic Thoughts\" form that you completed during the week for homework. Now look at the List of Thinking Errors in Figure 6.1 and see which distortions might be present in the 93 first thought. At this point, do not worry whether you truly believe the thought is distorted or not. For the sake of the exercise, assume it contains some Thinking Error and try to identify it. If possible, see if each thought can fit in two or three categories. You might find that one category best fits the thought but practicing using several categories gives you more opportunities to view your ATs more objectively. Write the Thinking Errors in the margin next to the AT. After you finish identifying the Thinking Errors in your own thoughts, look over your list and see if there was one that you used several times. Did one type of thinking dominate? If so, then that might be a common Thinking Error for you. As you practice monitoring and analyZing your ATs in the coming weeks, you will learn which thinking errors are most common for you. If you found that identifying the Thinking Errors was difficult, then you might want to practice with some more thoughts before going on to the next section. You can either imagine a Situation that makes you anxious and record your thoughts now or look back at some of the ATs from Chapter 4. Challenging Your Automatic Thoughts To this point you have learned the first two steps of cognitive restructuring: 1. Identifying your ATs and the emotions they cause 2. Examining the Thinking Errors in your ATs. Now it is time to learn about questioning and challenging the ATs to see how realistic or helpful they are. We are going to ask you to become a rational scientist and analyze what your ATs really mean. Sometimes we will even conduct experiments to see if they are true. If you are like most of the people we have worked with, you may be surprised at what you are really thinking! When someone is having difficulty with social anxiety, he or she may have been thinking the same automatic thoughts for a long time, maybe even most of his or her life. The thoughts may be so familiar that the person has never questioned them, never considered whether they were true or even if they made any sense. Thus, the best way to challenge ATs is to ask and answer a series of questions about the meaning of the thoughts. Note that we said Itask and answer.\" As you will see, answering the questions that you pose is an essential step in the process. Anumber of years ago, Drs. Lawrence Sank and Carolyn Shaffer came up with a list of questions to challenge ATs that we\\'ll call It Disputing Questions.\" This is a list of all-purpose questions that encourage a person to look at ATs from different perspectives. Some of the Disputing Questions are particularly appropriate for ATs with certain Thinking Errors and others work for a variety of thoughts. Over the 94 Disputing Questions Use these questions to challenge your automatic thoughts. Be sure to answer each question you pose to yourself. You will find each question helpful for many different thoughts. Several examples are also presented to help you get started. 1. Do I know for certain that ? Example: Do I know for certain that I won\\'t have anything to say? 2. Am I 100% sure that ? Example: Am I 100% sure that my anxiety will show? 3. What evidence do I have that ......:.. ? What evidence do I have that the opposite is true? Example: What evidence do I have that they did not understand my speech? What evidence do I have that they did understand my speech? 4. What is the worst that could happen? How bad is that? How can I cope with that? 5. Do I have a crystal ball? 6. Is there another explanation for ? Example: Is there another explanation for his refusal to have coffee with me? 7. Does have to lead to or equal ? Example: Does \"being nervous\" have to lead to or equal \"looking stupid\"? 8. Is there another point of view? 9. What does mean? Does really mean that I am a(n) ? Example: What does \"looking like an idiot\" mean? Does the fact that I stumbled over my words really mean that I look like an idiot? Adapted from Lawrence I. Sank and Carolyn S. Shaffer (1984), A Therapist\\'s Manual for Cognitive Behavior Therapy ill GrollpS, Plenum Press, p. 223. /., .. Fi~ure6~2~ 95 96 years, we have developed a few additional Disputing Questions that our clients have found particularly helpful. Alist of Sank and Shaffer\\'s Disputing Questions with our additions appears in Figure 6.2. Let\\'s take a look at how the Disputing Questions can be used to challenge ATs. Assume AI has the following AT when he thinks about asking his co-worker Lois out on a date: IIShe won\\'t go out with me.\" Based on what we covered in the previous section, this AT is a perfect example of Fortune Telling. Even before he asks her out, Al \"knows\" that Lois will turn down his invitation. Using the Disputing Questions, let\\'s see how reasonable AI\\'s assumption might be. AI could ask himself: Do I know for certain that Lois won\\'t go out with me? The answer to that question is: No, I don\\'t know what Lois will do. Then AI could use another Disputing Question to see how certain he is about what she will do: Am 1100% sure that Lois won\\'t go out with me? The answer is: I\\'m not 100% certain. There is probably a 50-50 chance she would go out with me. She seems very friendly and she was hinting that she did not have anything to do this weekend. Notice that Al started out thinking that Lois would not go out with him and now he is able to say that there is a 50% chance that she would say yes. AI\\'s change in thinking will probably lead to a change in his actions. It seems very unlikely that AI would ask Lois on a date if he believed she would refuse. However, he may ask her out now that he has reconsidered how she might respond. These examples illustrate several important points about how to use the Disputing Questions to challenge your automatic thoughts. First, pick the Disputing Question that seems to make the most sense for the thought. If the first one does not fit, try others. Second, put the AT in the blank in the Disputing Question if there is one. You may have to change the wording of your thought so that it makes a logical question. For example, the AT \"I\\'ll make a complete fool of myself\" could become \"What is the worst that could happen if I made a complete fool of myself?\" Third, Al had been thinking Lois would refuse to go out with him for qUite a while. It would have been easy for him to get stuck on that belief and not really think through another point of view unless he put the answer to the question into words. Sometimes just Writing down or saying the response to a Disputing Question aloud helps a person realize that the AT does not seem very logical or realistic. The list of Disputing Questions in Figure 6.2 will help you get started with challenging your automatic thoughts. As you use the list, you will find that some of the questions are particularly helpful for you. You will probably also develop other Disputing Questions that are not on the list. This list is definitely not exhaustive. There are many different approaches to challenging each AT. As you gain experience with the cognitive restructuring procedures, you will develop the one that works best for you. Now let\\'s look more closely at the process of challenging ATs by going back to Beth and her job interview. As you will see, it is helpful to challenge a given thought with several Disputing Questions. The Disputing Questions and answers can be conceptualized as the rational coping person inside of you talking with the anxious person inside of you. Beth\\'s first thought about her job interview was, iiI must make a good first impression or they won\\'t hire me.\" We found three primary Thinking Errors in this thought: Should Statement, All-or-Nothing Thinking, and Fortune Telling. In the follOWing dialogues, Coping Beth challenges Anxious Beth\\'s ATs. Anxious Beth: Coping Beth: Anxious Belli: Coping Beth: Anxious Beth: Coping Beth: Anxious Beth: Coping Beth: Anxious Beth: I must make a good first impression or they won\\'t hire me. What evidence do you have that if you don\\'t make a good first impression they won\\'t hire you? I don\\'t have any evidence but I am more likely to get the job if I make a good first impression. Does making a less-than-good first impression mean that you won\\'t get the job? Probably. Are you 100% sure that making a less-than-good first impression means that you won\\'t get the job? No, not 1000k. Sometimes you can make up for a bad first impression. So would it be fair to say to yourself-that it would be better to make a good first impression but even if you don\\'t, you could still get the job. Yes. I have most of the qualifications and they must have a good impression of me from my resume or they would not have invited me to interview. 97 As you can see, Beth used three of the Disputing Questions from the list to challenge this thought. In the last \"Coping Beth\" statement, she turned a negative statement around to make it positive. This is a bit like the proverbial glass that is half full or half empty. Both statements may be equally true but most of us would feel better with the half-full glass. This strategy works well as a Disputing Question. Now let\\'s look at another one of Beth\\'s thoughts. The three Thinking Errors we identified in this thought were Mind Reading, Disqualifying the Positive, and Fortune Telling. Anxlo. Beth: CopI.. Beth: Anx.us Beth: Copt.. Beth: Anxious Beth: Anxious Betla: They are going to think I don\\'t have enough experience. Do you know for certain that they will think you don\\'t have enough experience? No, I don\\'t know for certain. I am just worried they will think that. Let\\'s look at your worry, then. What evidence do you have that you have enough experience? The last two jobs I had were fairly similar to this one. The job announcement said that applicants need at least 2 years of experience. I have 3 years but the first was not full-time. So you have more than 2 years of experience and the announcement said you needed 2 years. Do you have any evidence that it is not enough? No. 98 For this thought, Beth used two Disputing Questions to challenge her AT about not having enough experience. Note that \"Coping Beth\" again re-stated the answers to one of the questions in slightly more positive terms. iiI have 3 years of experience but the first year wasn\\'t full time\" became \"So you have more than 2 years of experience.\" Note how the first statement by Anxious Beth makes it seem that she does not have enough experience but the second statement by Coping Beth points out that she actually has more experience than required! How do you think Beth felt before and after she applied these cognitive restructuring questions to her ATs? From her thoughts, it looks like Beth was very anxious about the interview. Think about what physical symptoms of anxiety you would have if you had those thoughts before a job interview. She probably had some butterflies in her stomach, perhaps more than a few. Do you think she felt a little less anxious after she had challenged the thoughts? It seems likely. As you read through the exchange between Anxious Beth and Coping Beth, notice that the tone of what she is saying to herself becomes more positive and optimistic. It is unlikely she would go into the interview perfectly calm. Almost everyone has some anxiety in job interviews. However, cognitive restructuring should help her feel a little calmer and make it more likely that she can think clearly and make a positive (not perfect!) first impression. Now go back to the ATs that you examined for the exercise on Thinking Errors above. Using the worksheet IIPractice Using Anxious Self/Coping Self Dialogue\" (Figure 6.3), have an {{anxious self/coping self\" dialogue with yourself about two or three of the thoughts. Write the AT on the first line as {{Anxious Self.\" Use one of the Disputing Questions to start to question the AT on the second line labeled {{Coping Self.\" Then on the third line have Anxious Self answer the Disputing Question. Try to go back and forth between Anxious Self and Coping Self several times until you feel that you can see a more positive point of view or at least can see the AT from a slightly different perspective. Repeat this process with two or three ATs until you begin to feel comfortable with it. Be patient with yourself. As with any new skill, it takes time and practice to learn cognitive restructuring and it may feel awkward or even silly at first. Then we will be ready to move on to the final step in cognitive restructuring-developing a Rational Response. Keep in mind that it is very likely that your answers to the Disputing Questions may not seem right and the process may seem artificial to you. This is an indication that you are uncomfortable with these new skills. It is also an indication that you are doing the right thing, not the wrong thing! Combating Automatic Thoughts with a Rational Response The next step in the cognitive restructuring procedure is to develop a Rational Response. ARational Response is a statement that summarizes or highlights the key points you have discovered as you worked through the Anxious Self/Coping Self dialogue. Often the Rational Response is a shorthand reminder to stay focused and think more rationally. When people are in a situation that makes them anxious, they can repeat the Rational Response to themselves as ATs arise. Let\\'s go back to Beth\\'s thoughts about her job interview to see what some Rational Responses might look like. Beth\\'s first AT that we challenged was III must make a good first impression or they won\\'t hire me.\" The Anxious Beth/Coping Beth dialogue ended with a more optimistic restatement by Coping Beth of one of the points: IIS0 would it be fair to say to yourself that it would be better to make a good first impression but even if you don\\'t, you could still get the job?\" This last statement is actually a Rational 99 Practice Using Anxious Self/Coping Self Dialogue Anxious Self (AT): Coping Self: Anxious Self: Coping Self: Anxious Self: Coping Self: Anxious Self: Coping Self: Anxious Self: Coping Self: Anxious Self: Coping Self: Anxious Self: Coping Self: 100 Copyright e 2000 by Graywind Publications Incorporated Response. However, it is quite a mouthful. For Beth to use it effectively in the job interview, it would be better if it were a little shorter. It could be shortened to \"I could still get the job even if I don\\'t make the best first impression\" or even \"Getting this job doesn\\'t depend on the first impression.\" When Beth goes to the interview and notices herself having ATs about how good an impression she is making, she could repeat the Rational Response to herself as a reminder to think more rationally. This reminder should help her feel less anxious as she thinks more about what is going on in the interview and does less Fortune Telling and Catastrophizing about not getting the position. To summarize, the steps in cognitive restructuring so far are: 1. Identify ATs and the emotions they cause 2. Identify Thinking Errors in the ATs 3. Use the Disputing Questions to ask and answer questions to challenge the ATs 4. Develop a Rational Response to combat the ATs when they occur. Let\\'s go back to Beth\\'s final thought and see another example of using the Disputing Questions and developing a Rational Response. Beth1s last thought was a common one for people with social anxiety disorder. This is an AT that comes up in many situations, from conversations to public speaking. Anxious Betll: I\\'ll stumble over my words. (Fortune Telling) Coping Betll: Is stumbling over your words really so important or consequential? AnxIous Beth: If I stumble over my words, I won\\'t look competent enough for this great job that I want. Coping Beth: Does stumbling over your words equal being incompetent? Anxious Beth: If I stumble over my words a lot, I won\\'t look very competent. Coping Beth: What is the likelihood that you will stumble over your words enough to look incompetent? AnxIous Beth: It could happen. I\\'m SUle I\\'ll stumble over my words some, especially at the beginning of the interview. Sometimes it gets better after the first question or two, so it probably is not that likely that I will stumble over my words enough to look incompetent Rational Response: Stumbling over my words a little is OK. 101 102 This Anxious Beth/Coping Beth dialogue is a good example of how analyzing an AT reveals another AT \"underneath\" the first one. At first it looked like Beth was just worried about stumbling over her words. However, that was important to her because she was worried about appearing incompetent. As she thought it through more carefully with the Disputing Questions, she was able to conclude that it was unlikely she would stumble so much that she would look incompetent. That allowed Beth to develop a Rational Response that recognized that she did not have to speak perfectly to appear competent. If she notices herself stumbling in the interview, she can remind herself that \"Stumbling over my words a little is OK.\" That reminder should help her calm down enough so that she can speak clearly. Over the years we have found that developing a Rational Response is the most difficult part of the cognitive restructuring for many people. It seems that people have lived with their ATs so long without questioning them that it is difficult to truly take a more rational point of view. With practice, Rational Responses become easier to develop. Here are some pointers to help you get started: 1. Agood Rational Response takes a positive (or at least neutral) view of the situation or symptoms. \"It probably won\\'t be a total disaster\" is not a good Rational Response. \"It will probably go OK\" or even \"It might go OK\" will be more effective. 2. Agood Rational Response is short. In fact, the shorter the Rational Response the easier it is to use. Sometimes it is helpful to reduce longer Rational Responses to short slogans. It is not necessary that the Rational Responses include all the details, but they should serve as a reminder for everything you thought through in the cognitive restructuring. \"Nervousness i\\'rejection\" is a good example of a slogan type of Rational Response. 3. You do not have to believe the Rational Responses, especially at first. In fact, it would be fairly unusual if you were able to reject your ATs so easily that the Rational Responses were totally believable right away. Cognitive restructuring is like a sculptor chipping away at a block of marble. For a while, it does not seem like much is happening, and it is hard to believe a beautiful sculpture will emerge. However, those first challenges to the ATs are essential to chip away the years of anxious thinking so that healthier, more helpful thoughts about yourself, other people, and social situations can emerge. You do not need to believe the Rational Response at first, but it is very important that you keep an open mind and be willing to consider it. 4. Rational Responses should be realistic. In other words, Rational Responses should represent rational thinking, not wishful thinking! Going back to Al who wants to ask Lois for a date, it would not be realistic for him to use a Rational Response that says \"I\\'m sure Lois will go out with me.\" It is no more rational for Al to predict that Lois definitely will go out with him than to predict that she will not. Abetter Rational Response for Al would acknowledge that he does not know what Lois will do but that he will never know if he does not invite her to go out. As we said in an earlier chapter, cognitive restructuring does not simply replace bad thoughts with good ones. Instead, it encourages you to think realistically about yourself, a situation, and other people. 5. If you are having trouble developing a Rational Response, try some of these that many people have found helpful. However, Rational Responses are very individualized, so just because it works for someone else does not mean it will work for you. _____\\'# The first blank is something you are worried about such as looking nervous, being rejected, experiencing an anxiety symptom, and so forth. The second blank is an outcome you are worried about such as not getting something you want. Some examples are: looking nervous \\'# looking foolish being rejected \\'# being alone forever not getting this job \\'# never getting a good job blushing \\'# looking stupid feeling anxious \\'# looking anxious Sometimes it is helpful to use cognitive restructuring to figure out what the absolutely worst thing that could happen would be. That can lead to good Rational Responses. The worst that can happen is and I can live with thatl is a good Rational Response for ATs about outcomes that are unpleasant but not awful. For example, if your worst fear is that you would be rejected by someone, blush, look silly or foolish, or be temporarily humiliated, then that might be a good Rational Response for you. On the other hand, if your worst fear is something you see as more serious (such as being fired from a job, never finding a marital partner, or missing an important promotion), then it makes more sense to think about how likely such an event might be. That could lead to the Rational Response of, The worst that can happen is , but that is unlikely. In the next chapter we will talk a lot about the last step in cognitive restructuring-setting reasonable goals for ourselves. However, attainable goals can also make good Rational Responses. Some common ones that our clients have developed over the years include: I only have to say hello. I only have to make it through the first couple of minutes, then I\\'ll be OK. I just need to get three points across. 103 Developing good Rational Responses takes time and practice. As you use the cognitive restructuring skills over and over, they will become routine. You might even find that you can shorten or even eliminate some of the steps. At this point, though, be sure to use all of the steps so you allow yourself to get the maximum benefit. Homework Between now and the next session it will be important for you to practice the cognitive restructuring skills. Look for one or two situations dUring the week that cause you some anxiety and work through all four steps using the worksheet in your packet entitled \"Cognitive Restructuring Practice\" (Figure 6.4). Acompleted example appears in Figure 6.5. At the top of the form is a place to describe the situation in a few words, then list your ATs. Try to list at least four or five ATs. In the column next to the ATs, identify the Thinking Errors in each one. Remember that most ATs contain more than one Thinking Error, depending upon how you think about the thought. Then pick two or three of the thoughts to challenge. Using the Disputing Questions, challenge the ATs one at a time with the Anxious Self/Coping Self dialogue. Finally, summarize the work you did with the Disputing Questions into a Rational Response. Feel free to expand the Anxious Self/Coping Self dialogue to another sheet of paper if needed. As always, if you do not have a situation arise this week that causes anxiety, use a situation from the past or imagine something coming up in the future. Try to imagine the situation as vividly as possible so that you will be able to identify your ATs. You should also continue the self-monitoring of your average daily anXiety and depression in the situations you are monitoring each week. .Self-i\\\\ssessment 1. Paying a great deal of attention to a negative detail of a situation T F (versus seeing the whole picture) is an example of the Thinking Error called Mind Reading. 2.

Answers to Self-Assessment questions can be found in Appendix A. 107  Getting Into the Pool: The First Exposure Session The last two chapters have focused on developing cognitive restructuring skills. As you have seen, cognitive restructuring is a procedure that helps you examine how you are thinking and consider whether there may be a more useful way to look at a situation that makes you anxious. Cognitive restructuring, by helping to reduce the anxiety that you experience, also makes it possible for you to handle more and more difficult situations. As with any new skill, the more you practice, the better you will become at analyzing and responding to your own automatic thoughts. However, if you are still confused about the cognitive restructuring procedure, spend a little extra time practicing with YOUI\\' therapist. Now it is time to begin the second component of treatment-therapeutic exposure to feared situations. This will give you a chance to start to apply the cognitive restructuring skills. Before beginning the first exposure, let\\'s take a moment to review how exposure works and why it is such a crucial step in overcoming social anxiety. As described in Chapter 3, therapeutic exposure means facing the situations that make you anxious. After all, the purpose of treatment is to be more comfortable with other people and so eventually you must face those fears. Remember that process will start with easier situations and work up to harder ones. You will most likely start with role plays of the situations with your therapist and gradually practice situations in your daily life. The Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy will help you and your therapist determine which situations to tackle first and which situations to save for later. 109 How Therapeutic Exposure is Helpful Exposure is helpful in at least four ways. 1. Habituation: If you stay in a situation that makes you anxious, your anxiety will eventually level off and then decrease. This happ~ns because your body automatically works to counteract the fear response by lowering your blood pressure and heart rate and slowing your breathing. You may not have discovered this if you have not stayed in anxiety-provoking situations long enough or if your negative thinking keeps feeding your anxiety. Also, some social situations are naturally so short that this process does not have an opportunity to occur. For example, introducing yourself to someone takes only a few moments, so it is difficult for habituation to take place. We have developed some special exposure procedures to handle those types of situations and will share these with you. 2. Practice: Exposure helps you overcome the behavioral component of anxiety because it gives you a chance to practice what to say and how to act in the situations that make you anxious. If someone has always avoided asking a person on a date, then practicing what to say and how to say it is essential. Even if you have been in the situation before, you might have been so anxious that you do not even remember what you said. One advantage of the roleplayed exposure is that the therapist can give you feedback on whether you are saying and doing things in a positive manner. 3. Identification of ATs: There are likely to be some very important ATs that only occur to you right in the middle of the situations that make you anxious. These ATs emerge when you are anxious and often play an important role in keeping your anXiety going. These powerful ATs have been called ({hot cognitions\" because they are so closely tied to your emotional experience. If you pay attention to your thoughts dUring exposures, you can identify the particular ATs that make your anxiety increase the most. Then, by challenging those ATs and developing Rational Responses to them, you will be well-prepared for the troublesome thoughts when they arise during the next exposure and when you face them in the real-life situation. 4. Testing out ATs: Another important use of exposure is to set up a situation that will allow you to test out whether or not an AT is accurate. Let\\'s say that Alice has the AT \"If there is a long silence, I won\\'t be able to handle it\" during conversations with potential dating partners. If she and her therapist want to test out that thought, she could have a conversation with her therapist in session that included a long silence in the middle. This would allow Alice to see what it felt like to sit in silence with someone for awhile. If she is like most people, she would learn two things. First, it is extremely unlikely that such a long silence would occur in an actual conversation because there is strong social pressure for each person to break the silence. In fact, Alice would probably think of several things to say. Second, although her anxiety would 110 initially increase, it would soon start to subside as the silence lengthened. In short, she would learn that, contrary to her AT, she can IIhandle\" a long silence, even though it would probably be fairly uncomfortable. As you can see, therapeutic exposure is a very powerful technique that helps with all three components of social anxiety-the physiological, the behavioral, and the cognitive. It is unlikely that one exposure to a situation will make all of your anxiety about that situation go away. It usually takes several exposures to the same situation for the anxiety to decrease dramatically. However, if you keep track of your SUDS during the exposure, you should see steady improvement as you enter a feared situation again and again. With practice, the anxiety should not rise as high and habituation should occur more quickly each time. In other words, the more times you practice, the anxiety should decrease more rapidly as you stay in the situation. The First In-Session Exposure In the next section we will cover all of the steps involved in completing your first exposure, including picking the situation, doing the cognitive work, setting a goal for yourself, entering the situation, and processing what you learned from the exposure. Although all of these steps might seem overwhelming and cumbersome at first, they will soon become routine. Picking a Situation Which situation should you use for your first exposure? There is no single answer to this question. Of all of the situations in which you experience social anxiety, it may not matter which one you attack first. However, there are some guidelines that will help make the first exposure a success. As you look at the Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy you constructed in Chapter 4 and think about possible exposure situations, look for one that meets the follOWing gUidelines: 1. In real life (as opposed to a role play), you would get a SUDS rating of40-50 on the oto 100 scale. Remember this is graduated exposure-you will start with easier situations first. Save the situations with higher SUDS ratings for later. However, you do not want to start with such an easy situation that you do not benefit from the exposure, because this will not help you to get over your anxiety very qUickly. If in doubt, pick a slightly easier situation for the first time. 2. The situation should be relevant to your ultimate goals in therapy. Many people become anxious when giving a speech. However, often that anXiety is not a problem because the person does not need to give speeches in his/her life. It does not make any difference if he or she is anxious giVing speeches or not. Do not pick a situation for exposure just because it makes you anxious. Pick something that you want to change. 111 112 Usually it takes several exposures to work up to your ultimate goal, so pick an exposure that isa step along the way. For example, if Howard\\'s ultimate treatment goal is to be more comfortable with women because he would like to get married and have a family, then one situation that makes him anxious is asking a woman to marry him. Making a proposal of marriage is not the best place to start treatment, however. For Howard, it would be better to start with casual conversations with women, then practice dating situations and expressing affection later on. 3. The situation should be straightforward. During the exposure you are likely to be anxious, you will be trying to use the cognitive restructuring skills, and you will be concentrating on talking and listening. All of that is complicated enough without having to confront a situation that is complex and/or difficult to stage. The first exposure should be a simple interaction or presentation that does not require extensive preparation or elaborate pretense. For example, Maria knows that she could meet some new friends if she would talk with people at her health club. Most of the women talk with one another while they are on the exercise bicycles. However, Maria usually takes a book to read because she is too nervous to participate in the conversation. As her first exposure, Maria could choose talking with someone on the adjacent exercise bicycle. However, this situation requires a role play in which both people pretend to ride a bicycle. It is difficult to make that seem realistic. In contrast, Maria could also talk with people while standing in line to use a piece of equipment. Both of these situations are equally anxiety-provoking for Maria and both would meet her goal of getting to know people. For her first exposure it would be better to stage having a conversation while waiting in line than the exercise bicycle situation. Here are some good situations to use for the first exposure: Conversation with a person you do not know very well who is ... seated next to you on a bus, train, or plane standing next to you in line somewhere a new co-worker seated near you in an employee lunchroom or cafeteria Speeches such as ... telling about a recent experience or vacation as if in a casual group of people reading aloud from a book or magazine If your primary concerns are about situations other than general social interaction or public speaking (such as eating or writing in front of others), then you may be able to adapt one of these suggested situations to include the specific thing you fear. At this point, you only need a fairly general idea of the situation for the first exposure. All of the details will get filled in later. As long as you have enough information to identify the ATs, you are ready to move to the next step-cognitive restructuring to prepare yourself for the exposure. Cognitive Restructuring Before each exposure you will go through the steps of cognitive restructuring that were covered in the last two chapters. This cognitive preparation will allow you to begin the exposure with Rational Responses in hand for the ATs you expect to have. Cognitive preparation also makes it more likely that the exposure will be helpful in overcoming your anxiety. Step 1. Imagine what it will be like to be in the situation you and your therapist have picked for the first exposure. It is sometimes helpful to imagine the situation as if it were on a movie screen in your head. As you liplay the movie\" in your imagination, pay attention to what ATs you are having. Try to write down at least four to five ATs. Think about how the ATs make you feel. Step 2. Identify Thinking Errors in the ATs. Step 3. Pick the one or two thoughts that seem the most troublesome or important and challenge them using the Disputing Questions. Remember to answer the question raised by each Disputing Question. Step 4. Review the disputes and challenges to the ATs in Step 3 and summarize them into one or two Rational Responses that you will be able to use dUring the exposure. Write the Rational Response(s) where you will be able to read it (them) during the exposure. You are now armed and ready for success in the exposure! Working Out the Details of the Exposure Situation Now it is time to fill in the details of what will happen in the role-played exposure. It is not necessary to figure out exactly what each person will say as if this were a movie script. Rather, outline the setting in which the interaction or speech will occur (e.g., at a home or office, in a bus, around a lunch table), the circumstances (e.g., the person sitting next to you on a plane, the weekly staff meeting, a midmorning coffee break) and the roles each person will play (e.g., a stranger, a female co-worker, your boss). The specific dialogue will simply evolve as the exposure situation proceeds. Usually for the first exposure, there are only two roles-yours (the client) and the other person\\'s (the therapist). Later, you might include several people in the exposure situation. However, if you are completing this treatment program as part of a therapy group, you might have several people in different roles even in the first exposure. 113 Setting an Achievable Behavioral Goal The fifth and last step in the cognitive restructuring before the exposure starts is to set an \"achievable behavioral goal\" so you will know if the exposure was a success. Everyone knows what a goal is-something you would like to accomplish. An \"achievable goal\" is one that you are likely to be able to meet. An achievable \"behavioral\" goal means that the goal is something observable and objective. In other words, the goal should be something that everyone can see and agree on whether or not you met it. The following are two lists of goals-the ones on the left are behavioral goals and the ones on the right are not. Behavioral Goals Say three things Stay in the situation even if I get anxious Learn two things about the other person Describe four ideas Invite her to a movie Ask him to have coffee Non-Behavioral Goals Don\\'t get anxious Feel like I did a good job Make a good impression Be helpful and friendly Look like I am competent Make him feel comfortable Communicate effectively 114 As you can see, the behavioral goals are all based on some type of observable behavior or something that can be objectively evaluated. For example, in a presentation you may want to communicate effectively (non-behavioral goal), but it is very difficult to determine whether or not that goal is met. What one person sees as effective in a presentation, another person may see as boring or confusing. You might argue that part of communicating effectively is to get your ideas across to the audience. However, \"describe four ideas\" is an excellent behavioral goal because it is under your control. You can also check out whether your audience learned something about these four ideas after the presentation, but remember that your goal is to do the best job you can of describing the ideas. Non-behavioral goals based on feelings (\"feel like I did a good job\" or \"make him feel comfortable\") are difficult to evaluate because only the person with the emotion knows exactly what it feels like. Feelings are difficult to measure objectively because other people cannot necessarily see how you feel. Also, we do not have much control over how other people feel, so setting a goal such as \"make him feel comfortable\" may not be achievable no matter how well you do in the exposure. Setting the Goal of Not Being Anxious It is often tempting to set the goal of not being anxious. Indeed, this is probably the overall goal you have for therapy-to not be anxious (or at least not very anxious) in social and/or performance situations. However, there are two problems with this goal. First, it is a big goal for a single exposure. If you have been experiencing social anxiety for even a few months, it is unlikely the problem will go away immediately. Second, as was discussed in Chapter I, some social anxiety is a normal part of life. No matter how successful this treatment program is for you, you will probably experience anxiety from time to time. A more appropriate long-term goal is to accomplish what you want to in situations, despite the anxiety you experience. If you keep meeting that goal, the anxiety will take care of itself. The Importance of Setting Goals Why is it important to set a goal for the exposure? In our work with people with social anxiety, we have noticed that they are often their own worst critics. No matter how well someone does in an exposure, it is too easy to focus on what went wrong. This is a good example of Disqualifying the Positive. All-or-Nothing Thinking plays a role as well. Let\\'s look at an example. Before Andy completed an exposure of having a conversation with a new female co-worker, he was very anxious, and his ATs indicated that he was worried about even being able to say hello to her. However, after the exposure, in which he carried on a very appropriate conversation for nearly 10 minutes, he believed he had failed because he had stumbled over the punch line of a joke he was trying to tell. This is a good example of the Thinking Error of Disqualifying the Positive because Andy did not give himself credit for carrying on the conversation. He discounted his success. All-or-Nothing Thinking is evident in that stumbling at one point in the conversation equaled failure. If Andy had set an achievable behavioral goal of \"saying hello and three more things\" before the exposure started, he would have had good ammunition to challenge his Thinking Errors and be able to take credit for his success after the exposure was over. Reaching an achievable goal would have provided evidence to counter his tendency to Disqualify the Positive. Then the next time he faced a similar situation, he would be able to use his previous success as evidence against his ATs. Setting an achievable behavioral goal helps you take credit for your successes after the exposure and makes preparing for future situations easier. Completing the Exposure During the exposure itself, you will be role playing the situation, usually with your therapist as the other person in the role play (at least for the first exposure or two). These in-session exposures are simulations, not perfect replications, of the actual situation. As discussed in Chapter 2, this has advantages and disadvantages. Role playing allows you to work on your anxiety in a relatively safe environment, without consequences if things do not go as well as you would like. On the other hand, it is sometimes difficult to pretend and you might feel silly at first. However, the exposure will be most effective if you can put yourself into the situation and try to make it as realistic as possible. If you keep telling yourself \"this isn\\'t real\" or \"this doesn\\'t count,\" then the exposure will not be as effective in helping you 115 116 to overcome your anxiety. Also try to stay \"in role.\" This means that during the exposure you should continue with the simulation rather than interrupting to make comments or ask questions. If you focus your attention on the aspects that are realistic and act as if it were the real situation without interruption, you will be better prepared for the actual event. If you find yourself doing something to interrupt the exposure or make it less real, then you should honestly ask yourself if this is a form of avoidance. Someone who is anxious about an exposure could avoid truly facing the fears by interrupting the exposure to ask questions or make comments. Such avoidance might include thinking, \"This isn\\'t real so it doesn\\'t really matter how I do\" or making jokes or acting silly. Doing these sorts of things to avoid fully participating in the exposure is like jumping into the pool and trying to swim but never letting go of the edge of the pool. Technically you are in the water and kicking and moving your arms. However, until you are willing to let go and fully commit yourself to moving through the water, you can never build up your skills and confidence as a swimmer. Similarly, to overcome your fear in the situations that make you anxious, you need to fully commit yourself and try to tolerate the anxiety you experience rather than sneaking away from it. As discussed above, staying with an exposure will allow the anxiety to peak and decrease through the process of habituation. Before, during, and after the exposure your therapist will ask you to give ratings of how anxious you are feeling. These ratings will use the scale that you used when constructing your Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy. Remember this is the Subjective Units of Discomfort Scale (SUDS). The lowest rating is 0 (not at all anxious) and the highest rating is 100 (the worst social anxiety you can imagine). If you are having trouble concentrating, then your SUDS rating is at least a SO. If you are thinking that you want to get out of the situation, then your SUDS rating is at least 75. Your therapist will ask you to give a SUDS rating immediately before the exposure starts. Then, periodically, your therapist will interrupt the exposure and say \"SUDS.\" Just quickly give a number that reflects how nervous you are feeling at that moment and get right back into the role play. At first this will be a little awkward but most people qUickly adjust to it. It does not matter that you give precisely the right number. A\"ballpark figure\" is fine. Then as the exposure ends, the therapist will ask you for a final SUDS rating. The SUDS ratings will be useful in several ways. First, they communicate how anxious you are feeling to your therapist as the exposure is going on. Your therapist is able to combine his or her observations of how anxious you appear and what you are saying and doing dUring the role play with your SUDS ratings to have a good understanding of the experience. This will help your therapist make the exposure as helpful as possible for you. Second, the SUDS ratings are useful in tracking your progress over several weeks. As you keep doing exposures, your average SUDS rating for exposures of similar difficulty should get lower. Finally, the SUDS can be very useful in the cognitive restructuring that you will do after the exposure is over. When your therapist asks you for SUDS ratings, he or she will also ask you to repeat your Rational Response aloud. The purpose of saying your Rational Response aloud is to encourage you to use it to combat your ATs during the exposure. It is easy to fall into the old familiar thought patterns that make you anxious without taking advantage of work you did to try and challenge those thoughts. The more you are able to use the Rational Response during the exposure, the more likely you will be to disrupt your ATs. That will make you less anxious in the long run. So remember, when you read the Rational Response, do not just say the words, but carefully consider their important implications for your life! Do\\'s and Don\\'ts of Therapeutic Exposure As you can see, there is quite a lot going on dUring an exposure. Let\\'s summarize the \"Do\\'s and Don\\'ts.\" 1. Do throw yourself into the role playas completely as possible. 2. Don\\'t try to avoid the anxiety by interrupting the role play or making it less realistic. 3. Do say your Rational Response to yourself as ATs come up. 4. Do repeat your Rational Response aloud when you give a SUDS rating. 5. Do give SUDS ratings quickly without worrying about being too precise. Trying to be too precise could be a subtle way to avoid fully participating in the exposure. 6. Do stay in role until your therapist says it is time to stop. 7. Don\\'t be discouraged if it does not goes as well as you would like. Remember it usually takes repeated exposures to fully conquer one\\'s fears. After the Exposure: Debriefing the Experience The first thing to do after the exposure is to take a deep breath, relax, and congratulate yourself for having the courage to work on your fears. There are many other helpful things to do after the exposure. We\\'ll review some of the basic ones here. 117 118 Reviewing Your Goal One of the first things to do after the exposure is to review your behavioral goaL We have found that it is very common for people to either totally forget what their goal was or to remember it differently than it was. That is why it is important to always write it down. Review your goal and ask yourself if you achieved it. Be careful as you decide whether you achieved your goal. Most people with social anxiety have difficulty objectively analyzing whether they met their goal. One of the Thinking Errors, Disqualifying the Positive, may influence how you see your goal. Aperson might dismiss the goal as being trivial despite the fact that it was seen as quite difficult before the exposure began. Let\\'s look at a concrete example. Mohammed will have to deliver a speech in a few weeks at a luncheon meeting of the local Chamber of Commerce, about which he is quite anxious. For his first exposure, he and his therapist agreed that he would start to work towards this speech by just talking through the ideas he plans to present while seated. He set a behavioral goal of making two specific points about the future of business in his community. Mohammed thinks he will have more points to make during the actual speech but he and his therapist decided to set a goal of only two since this is the first time he has forced himself to think about what he will present. During the exposure, he became very anxious, with his highest SUDS rating being 95. However, despite the high anxiety, he was able to talk through several ideas, not just two. After the exposure, Mohammed told his therapist that he did not achieve his goal because he became very anxious. His therapist pointed out that \"not getting anxious\" was not the behavioral goal they had set. Mohammed engaged in Disqualifying the Positive because he ignored what he did well, namely making more points than he initially thought he could make. By focusing on his anxiety, he failed to give himself credit for his accomplishment. Instead of seeing the exposure as a success, it became another in a long list of perceived failures. It is important not to ignore the fact that Mohammed eventually wants to be less anxious while speaking in public. However, it is unlikely he will be able to overcome his anxiety in the long run unless he gives himself credit for what he is able to accomplish in each exposure along the way. Reviewing ATs Immediately after the exposure it is helpful to review the effectiveness of your cognitive restructuring efforts. This review can focus around three questions: 1. Did I have the ATs I expected to have? 2. How well did the Rational Response I had developed combat these ATs? 3. Were there ATs that I did not anticipate having? If you had some or all of the ATs you expected to have, then the cognitive restructuring you worked on before the exposure should have helped you challenge and rebut those expected ATs. However, most people are not 100% effective at challenging these ATs the first time. For the first exposure, a realistic goal would be recognizing the thoughts as ATs (as opposed to viewing them as logical statements of fact) and attempting to use your Rational Response. The second question is whether the Rational Response seemed to be working or whether it seemed irrelevant or \"off track.\" Usually Rational Responses just need some fine-tuning, but sometimes a person has to start over. ARational Response that seems fine beforehand may not seem very powerful when the person is actually in the anxiety-provoking situation. With most exposures, you will find that there were some ATs that you did not expect to have. As you will remember, identifying these ATs that occur in the heat of the moment-the \"hot cognitions\" -is one of the purposes of exposure. Once they are identified, you can go through the steps of cognitive restructuring and develop a Rational Response. Then you will be prepared the next time the unexpected ATs come up. What Did You Learn? Usually the last thing that we say to clients as we finish debriefing an exposure is, \"What can you take from this experience that you can use in the future?\" As you have seen, completing an exposure is a complicated procedure with lots of different steps. As you go through the experience, you may think about yourself or the world in a new way. You may discover things about yourself that you have never considered before. You will probably experience anxiety but you may experience many other emotions such as sadness, anger, or a sense of accomplishment. You may have tried to do something-such as ask a person for a date or express your feelings-that you have never done before. Because of everything that is going on in an exposure, it is helpful to try and summarize one or two main points for yourself. Here are some of the things our clients have said to us in response to the question, \"What can you take from this experience that you can use in the future?\" If I hang in there, it gets easier. Even though I am very anxious, I can still carryon a conversation. Even though I am very anxious, I won\\'t pass out. It was harder than I thought it would be, but I still made it through. rhe shaking in my hands is not as noticeable as I thought it was. I must not look as nervous as I feel inside. Once I get past the first couple of minutes, I can do OK. 119 Homework After the First In-Session Exposure The procedures we have just described outline the procedure you and your therapist will use for role-played therapeutic exposures within your therapy sessions. Remember that the third component of treatment is homework. After you have done the first exposure in session, you and your therapist will negotiate a homework assignment for an exposure on your own. Usually this will be something that relates to the exposure you completed in the session. Because exposures in real life are often more anxiety-provoking than exposures within the session, it is a good idea to pick an assignment for your homework that is a little easier. You will also be practicing the cognitive skills dUring your homework. At the end of the chapter you will find more details about the homework and a worksheet to use for the cognitive restructuring. Chuck\\'s First Exposure: The Friday Afternoon Conversation Now that we have talked about the various aspects of cognitive restructuring and role-playing that go into the first exposure, we will use an example to help bring these ideas to life. Chuck is a 32-year-oldman who gets very nervous when he has casual conversations with other people, including people he knows fairly well. He feels much less anxious if the conversation is about something specific, such as talking with a co-worker about a project. Chuck says that he does not know how to make \"small talk.\" One of the situations on Chuck\\'s Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy is the Friday afternoon get-together at a local bar with people from work. Chuck would like to go regularly but has only gone twice in the last several years. Once it went well because he ended up talking with someone about work the whole time. The second time, however, everyone was talking about more personal topics, including their upcoming vacations. That time Chuck became extremely anxious and left early. Chuck and his therapist have decided to tackle this situation for his first exposure. Chuck anticipates that he would have the folloWing ATs dUring the Friday afternoon get-together: I don\\'t know how to make small talk. I\\'ll get very nervous. I won\\'t have anything to say. Chuck and his therapist have agreed that they should focus the cognitive restructuring on the third thought, I won\\'t have anything to say. This AT makes Chuck feel anxious, and he feels he would be embarrassed if he had nothing to say. After looking at the List of Thinking Errors, Chuck recognizes that this thought might be an example of All-or-Nothing Thinking because it implies that he would have absolutely nothing to say. There is also some Fortune Telling in that he has predicted what will happen before even going to the bar. Chuck agrees with his therapist that he might also be discounting anything he might say as unimportant. 120 Using several different Disputing Questions, the therapist helped Chuck challenge this thought: Therapist: What is the likelihood that you will have absolutely nothing to say? Chack: Not that likely. I\\'ll at least say hello, and everyone usually talks about what appetizers to order. I can say something about that, but then I won\\'t have anything else to say. Therapist: What does everyone else usually talk about after ordering the appetizers? Chack: Usually just stupid stuff. That\\'s why I don\\'t know what to say. Therapist: Define I/stupid stuff.\" Chack: Sometimes they just joke around. Sometimes they talk about the weather. The one time I was there they talked about summer vacations. They might talk about movies they have seen. Therapist What evidence do you have that you cannot talk about the weather, summer vacations, or movies? Chack: I could probably talk about that stuff. I just don\\'t want to sound stupid or like I don\\'t have anything important to say. Therapist: Does talking about the weather, summer vacations, and movies mean you sound stupid? Chuck: Maybe. Therapist: When your co-workers talk about the weather, summer vacations, and movies do they sound stupid? Chack: Not really, I guess, mostly I guess they are just relaxing and haVing a good time. It is good to unwind after the work week. Therapist: So talking about the weather, summer vacations, and movies might sound stupid but it could also sound like unwinding and having a good time? Chuck: Yes. 121 122 Chuck and his therapist go on to develop a Rational Response. Chuck wants the Rational Response to remind him that it is OK to talk about the topics he considers a little stupid because that is what everyone else does. The purpose of the Friday afternoon get-togethers is to have a good time, not to have serious conversation. To remind himself of all of that, Chuck chooses lilt\\'s OK to talk about the weather\" as his Rational Response. Chuck\\'s therapist suggests that they set the role play up to start right after the appetizer order has been placed. That way they will not have to pretend to be ordering food and it is the more difficult part for Chuck. The therapist will play the role of one of Chuck\\'s co-workers. They talk about how well Chuck knows this co-worker. They agree that they will not talk about work. They rearrange the furniture so it will seem like they are sitting across a table from each other. The corner of the therapist\\'s desk serves as the table. Once the situation has been fully defined, Chuck and his therapist develop an achievable behavioral goal: Chuck will say three things that are not answers to direct questiOns. Chuck is worried that it would be too easy if he just had to answer questions posed by his \"co-worker.\" Mer the therapist asks for Chuck\\'s initial SUDS rating, the role play proceeds. Chuck gives SUDS ratings and repeats his Rational Response about every minute. Mer about 6 minutes, the therapist ends the role play and they started to debrief the exposure. Chuck\\'s SUDS ratings were 35 before the exposure started, and 50, 70, 70, 60, 60, 50 during the exposure. Mer reminding him to congratulate himself for making it through the first exposure, Chuck\\'s therapist asks him whether he has achieved his goal. After first talking about how he felt fairly anxious during the exposure, Chuck remembers that his goal was to say three things that were not answers to direct questions. The therapist confirms Chuck\\'s opinion that he has indeed said many more than three things and together they list about eight of them. When Chuck and his therapist review the ATs he experienced during the exposure, Chuck reports that he had had two of the ones he anticipated having\" I don\\'t know what to say\" and \"I\\'m getting very nervous.\" Chuck reports that at one point, there was a pause in the conversation and he started worrying about what to say. He then made a comment about how it was supposed to be an especially cold winter. Thus, he used his Rational Response that it was OK to talk about the weather. Chuck also reports an unexpected AT: \"My co-worker will think it\\'s strange that I am talking so much more than I usually do.\" Chuck classifies this as Mind Reading because he was making assumptions about what his co-worker thought. Using the Disputing Question \"Does talking more than usual necessarily mean I\\'m strange?\" Chuck is able to arrive at a Rational Response. He decides that \"Being friendlier isn\\'t strange\" would help him remember that people might be surprised if he were more talkative, but that it would probably be seen as something positive. When Chuck\\'s therapist asks him what he could take from this experience, he concludes that he has learned that it is OK to talk about minor, everyday things like the weather because everyone does it. Chuck does not think he is quite ready to go to the Friday afternoon get-together immediately but he agrees to start three conversations about topiCS not related to work during the week. This will give him a chance to practice making small talk with co-workers. Then in a week or two, he might be ready to go to the Friday event. Chuck and his therapist discuss how it would be important for him to use the cognitive restructuring skills to help control his anxiety and make the experiences more beneficial. Homework After you complete the first exposure in session with your therapist it is time to try an exposure during the week on your own. This is the first step in transferring what you are learning in the therapy sessions to your real life. It is essential that you and your therapist pick an exposure situation that will be a little challenging but still be something that you are confident you can complete. Typically homework aSSignments relate to the in-session exposure. In the above example, Chuck picked a situation that was relevant to the role-played exposure he had completed but was not quite as difficult. This is an excellent strategy. Right now the cognitive restructuring procedures that you do before and after the exposure probably seem very complicated. Believe it or not, they will soon become second nature to you as you get more practice with them. To help you along, we have developed a worksheet (Figure 7.1) called \"Be Your Own Cognitive Coach\" or \"BYOCC\" for short. This worksheet will take you through all of the cognitive restructuring steps before and after the exposure you do on your own. Complete the front side before the exposure, then use the back side to debrief the experience. Make copies of the BYOCC worksheet for use throughout the rest of your treatment. The BYOCC form that Chuck completed for his homework assignment of starting conversations with three co-workers appears in Figure 7.2. As you can see, Chuck filled in a brief description of the situation he was using for homework in the top box. Then, the evening before he planned to do his homework, he sat down and considered the ATs he expected to have about the conversations and wrote them in the appropriate box. (Note that the numbers in some of the boxes coordinate with the lists of the steps for cognitive restructuring procedures that appear at various places in this manual.) In the bottom half of the AT box is a place to indicate the emotions related to these ATs. Chuck decided to focus on the AT \"I don\\'t know how to make small talk\" because he had already worked on the second AT (\\'IThey will think it is strange that I\\'m so talkative\") with his therapist. Chuck thought it was likely he would get nervous since he was doing something new so he did not challenge the third AT. You can see the Thinking Errors that Chuck identified in 123 124 the box next to the ATs. There is a short list of the Thinking Errors on the BYOCC worksheet, but you will probably need to use the List of Thinking Errors (Figure 6.1) that explains them in more detail for now. Later this abbreviated list should be all you need. After Chuck identified the Thinking Errors in the AT \"I don\\'t know how to make small talk\" and the emotions he was feeling, he moved on to Step 4 in the procedure, challenging the AT using the Disputing Questions. See the questions and his answers on his BYOCC worksheet. Note that the Disputing Questions are abbreviated on the worksheet for your convenience. At first you will probably need to refer to the more extended Disputing Questions list (Figure 6.2). Chuck\\'s three Rational Responses appear in the box near the bottom of the page. Two are from the work he did in session with his therapist-\"Being friendlier isn\\'t strange\" and \"It\\'s OK to talk about the weather.\" The third Rational Response he developed from the worksheet-\"There isn\\'t much small talk in short conversations.\" Chuck\\'s achievable behavioral goal followed directly from the homework assignment from his therapist-\"Start three conversations.\" He did not need to have long conversations for the assignment to be a success; he just needed to initiate them. Mter he got home from work the next day, Chuck debriefed his experience with the therapeutic exposures he did for homework. Using the back of the BYOCe worksheet, he noted that he had achieved his goal of starting three conversations. He had the ATs he expected to have and felt that the Rational Responses had worked fairly well. He did not have any unexpected ATs. In the box labeled \"What did you learn?\" Chuck noted that people had seemed very friendly and eager to visit with him a little. This was a surprise and made him feel good about the conversations he had started. Summary of Homework for Chapter 7 1. Continue self.monitoring as in previous weeks. 2. Complete an exposure on your own as negotiated with your therapist. Use the BYOCC worksheet (Figure 7.1) to guide the cognitive restructuring before and after the exposure. As you go through this treatment program, you will be filling out a number of forms to help you learn about your reactions and work through the cognitive restructuring and exposures. Save all of these forms. You may find it helpful to refer back to Disputing Questions or Rational Responses that you found particularly useful. Also, in Chapters 12 and 13, you will need to review the work you have done in order to complete some of the exercises in advanced cognitive restructuring and evaluating your progress.

Answers to Self-Assessment questions can be found in Appendix A. 129  Settling Into the Journey: The Ongoing Routine of In-Session and Homework Exposures In the last chapter we described how to do the first therapeutic exposure. Getting through the first exposure is a big step towards your ultimate goal of overcoming your social anxiety. Over the next several weeks you will use the same combination of cognitive restructuring and therapeutic exposure as you work your way up the situations listed on your Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy. This basic set of procedures is the key to conquering your fears. In this chapter we will describe how to go through a series of exposures. You will see that the emphasis will shift from exposures you do in session with your therapist to tackling real-life situations on your own. The steps for therapeutic exposure are outlined in Figure 8.1. This one page contains the keys to the entire treatment program. You will want to refer to it often. How To Pick Situations For Exposure In the previous chapter, we described how to pick the situation to tackle first. Assuming that the first exposure went well, you will be ready to move on to a second situation. For some people, each exposure is a variation on a single theme. For example, all of your exposures might revolve around conversations with people. On the other hand, you might have two or three exposures on one theme (e.g., conversations with people or talking on the telephone) and then two or three exposures on another theme (e.g., speaking in front of groups or being assertive). In either case, there are a few guidelines that will help you and your therapist choose the situations for you to address and determine how you should sequence your efforts. Tackle Easier Situations First The Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy provides a road map for exposures. The first exposure probably involved a situation in the bottom third of the Hierarchy. Try to pick something just a bit harder each time. However, if in doubt, it is better to 131 132 move too slowly than to attempt something that will create an extreme amount of anxiety. If the situation is too difficult, you might have trouble paying attention to your ATs and using your Rational Response. On the other hand, if you are only getting a little anxious in exposure situations, this is a sign that you can move on to more difficult situations more qUickly. As a rule of thumb, we have found that it takes the typical client three to six exposures in the therapy session to approach the most difficult situation of a particular type. Steps for Overcoming Social Anxiety with Exposure and Cognitive Restruduring (Record Responses on the BYOCC Worksheet for Homework Exposures) Before entering the exposure situation ... 1. Pick an anxiety-provoking situation that you would like to work on. 2. As you imagine yourself in that situation, identify the ATs and emotions caused by the ATs. 3. Identify Thinking Errors in the ATs. 4. Challenge 1-2 of the ATs with Disputing Questions. Be sure to answer the questions. S. Summarize answers to Disputing Questions into a Rational Response. 6. Think about the situation in more detail and pick an achievable behavioral goal. Enter the exposure situation ... 7. Complete the exposure, using the Rational Response to help control your anxiety. Stay in the situation until it reaches a natural conclusion or your anxiety decreases. After the exposure is over . . . 8. Debrief your experience in the situation: Did you achieve your goal? Did you have the ATs you expected to have? How well did the Rational Response work? Did you have unexpected ATs? Take a moment to challenge them now (Steps 3 to 5 above). 9. Summarize what you can take from this experience that you can use in similar situations in the future. Each Exposure Should Build on the Last One If you are like many individuals with social anxiety disorder, you probably have fears in several different types of situations. However, it is typically best to work on only one type of situation at a time. Consider the person who gets anxious in casual conversations, speaking in front of a group, and eating with other people. It is more helpful to work through several exposures on casual conversations before doing any exposures on speaking in front of a group or eating with other people. In this way you and your therapist can work from simpler situations to more complex ones within a single theme. Use Exposures to Challenge ATs Remember that one of the purposes of exposure is to set up situations in which you can test out whether or not your ATs are accurate. You and your therapist may choose a situation for exposure in which you worry that a particular negative outcome may occur and then examine whether it actually happens. Common examples of this strategy include the evaluation of what will happen in situations when there is a long silence in a conversation, an audience member asks a rude or difficult question during a speech, someone refuses an invitation for a date, or you spill food or drink at a party. By facing events like these during an exposure in the therapy session, you can practice how you would handle a particularly difficult situation before you have to face it in real life. You may also discover that ATs about catastrophic consequences turn out to be unrealistic. How Cognitive Restructuring Changes as You Tackle Different Situations The basic procedures for cognitive restructuring are the same throughout this workbook. However, the ATs you challenge will be somewhat different. At first your therapist will help you challenge ATs that are important but possibly some~ what superficial. By IIsuperficial\" we mean ATs that relate to the situation that makes you anxious and to your reactions and those of the other people involved. These are the types of ATs we have used in most of our examples-\"I won\\'t know what to say\" or III\\'lllook nervous.\" Later you will begin to challenge what we call IIcore beliefs.\" These are ATs that relate more to your central, basic beliefs about yourself and the world. You might think of core beliefs as the engines that power your ATs in specific situations. \"I\\'m flawed\" and lII\\'m an impostor\" are examples of core beliefs that some of our clients have discovered they have about themselves. Right now you are probably not very aware of your core beliefs. That is OK. As you continue through treatment, your therapist can help you become more aware of them. In Chapter 12, we describe some ways to discover and understand your core beliefs and then how to change the ones that cause you problems. 133 The Relationship Between Exposures, Cognitive Restructuring, and Homework Each week you and your therapist will negotiate a homework assignment for an exposure that you can do on your own during the week. As we said earlier, it is very important to complete these assignments because they are the link between what happens in therapy sessions and conquering your fears in your daily life. When you do the homework, you should use the BYOCC worksheet to do the cognitive restructuring work for yourself before and after the assigned exposure. That repeated practice will assure that you have these skills firmly in place so you are prepared to handle any anxiety-provoking situations that arise after treatment is over. Remember, the goal of this treatment program is not to eliminate all social anxiety. Social anxiety is a normal part of life. Rather, the goal of treatment is to overcome the anxiety in situations that you face regularly and prepare you to cope with any anxiety that you do experience. Over the course of the treatment sessions, your therapist will gradually help you face more and more difficult situations through the use of homework assignments. In fact, many of our clients get to the point that they no longer do iIi-session role-played exposures of situations first. They have made sufficient progress that they talk over the situation with the therapist, including getting the therapist\\'s help working through the cognitive restructuring. Then, with Rational Responses in place, they tackle the situation and report back to the therapist the following week. From that point, it is usually only a short time before the client is ready to stop seeing the therapist regularly and work through the situations that arise on his or her own. You may use this client workbook as a reference guide and reminder of key points when working on your own. Summary of the Course of the Treatment Program As you work through the treatment program, you can summarize your progression as follows: ;;, From easier (less anxiety-producing) to harder (more anxiety-producing) situations From less complex to more complex situations From more superficial ATs to ATs related to your core beliefs about yourself and the world From working on your anxiety in session with your therapist to working on your anxiety on your own in everyday life 134 Frequently Asked Questions In this chapter we tried to give you an overview of what to expect in the weeks that follow your first exposure. Now we will answer some of the most common questions that our clients have asked over the years. You should also talk about any questions or concerns you have with your therapist. 1. Will I have to do an exposure for every single situation in which I get anxious? That will take a long time. The answer to this question is probably not. Through a process called \"generalization,\" what you learn in one exposure can be applied to similar situations. For example, if you are working on overcoming dating anxiety, using an exposure to practice asking out one person will probably help you be less anxious when you ask out a different person. Does that mean that exposures related to your dating anxiety will be helpful for your fear of talking with your supervisor? That varies from person to person. If you have similar ATs in both situations, then you may find that working on your dating anxiety \"generalizes\" so that you are less anxious talking with your supervisor. However, if you have different ATs and different fears in those two situations, then you may have to work on dating and talking with your boss separately. As you get more and more skilled at challenging your ATs and confronting situations that make you anxious, overcoming fears in new situations can be accomplished more quickly. 2. All of these procedures are complicated. Can I leave some out? Do I have to do the cognitive restructuring? For now we strongly recommend that you do not skip over any of the procedures. It may sometimes seem tedious to work through each step of the cognitive restructuring before the exposure then carefully debrief the experience afterwards. However, that hard work will payoff in the long run. Also remember that the procedures become easier with more practice. In fact, most of our clients find that identifying and challenging their ATs becomes \"second nature\" and happens almost automatically when they notice themselves becoming nervous. In fact, anxiety should become a signal that it is time to examine your ATs. Once you get to this point, you may find that you do not have to go through all of the steps. One client told us, \"When I get nervous I know I am mind reading. I just take a moment to figure out whose mind I\\'m trying to read and then remind myself that I\\'m not 100% certain of what they are thinking.\" This client knew herself so well that she was able to move qUickly to the Rational Response and proceed with the situation. However, that skill and self-awareness were the result of many weeks of systematic effort working through the procedures we have outlined on the BYOCC worksheet. 3. I have been avoiding things so long, I do not have anyone to talk with for my homework. How will I be able to do the assignments? Occasionally people have become very isolated because of their social fears. You may have come to the point that you are unemployed or work in a job with very little contact with other people. You may not participate in the 135 136 community or be a member of any organizations. You may do your grocery shopping at night so you do not have to talk with people. The first thing to do is to be honest with your therapist about your isolation from other people. Then he or she can help you think of some ways to begin to have contact with people gradually. Your therapist might have you begin greeting people whom you see only briefly, such as a shop clerk, a neighbor, the mail carrier, the receptionist in your therapist\\'s office, and so forth. Later you can look for opportunities to get more involved with people with whom you might have common interests by attending community events or taking an adult education class. 4. The situation that I really need to conquer only comes up once a year. How will I be able to practice that? This is an excellent question and may present a real challenge in therapy. As you know, this treatment program relies on repeated exposures to the situations in which you experience anxiety. If those situations come up rarely, it is difficult to practice repeatedly! Infrequent but highly anxiety-provoking situations include toasts at wedding receptions, yearly business events such as the holiday party or summer picnic, or presentations at an annual meeting or conference. Usually your therapist can help you create a role play of the feared situation within the therapy session that will give you an opportunity to practice. Another solution is to try to find similar situations that you can use for exposures as homework. This might involve becoming an officer in an organization so that you have to run meetings and speak in front of the group regularly. You may be able to volunteer for work assignments or social engagements that allow you to do .something similar to what you fear most. If your social anxiety is limited to a few situations that arise very infrequently, and you have tried everything we just discussed to no avail, then you might want to talk with your therapist about whether certain types of medication could be helpful. As you will see in Dr. Liebowitz\\'s chapter on medication at the end of this manual, there are some medications that you only have to take on the day that you need them. For some people, adding those medications to the cognitive restructuring skills you have already learned may be helpful. Then, over time, you may be able to stop using the medication as you gain more confidence. S. I am very busy. What if I don\\'t have time to do the homework? As you have discovered by now, the treatment program described in this workbook asks you to do a lot. It is much more than a weekly visit with your therapist. In fact, you will see that we will be asking you to do something every day to work on your anxiety. Completing the homework is essential to your success. If you really do not have time to do the program right now, then you should wait until you can make more time for it in your busy life. Before you decide to wait, however, ask yourself whether being \"too busy!! is just a sophisticated way to avoid facing your fears. Sometimes being busy allows a person to distract him- or herself from having to recognize being lonely or that life is not going the way one had hoped. An honest discussion with a therapist can help you sort through your thoughts and feelings about taking time for this treatment program. You should also treat \"I\\'m too busy\" as an AT and work through the steps of cognitive restructuring to see if there might be some distorted thinking before making a decision to stop or delay treatment due to lack of time. On the other hand, everyone misses a homework assignment now and then. You might become ill or have something unexpected happen. However, your progress towards a calmer, more confident self will be seriously hampered if you skip too many homework assignments. If you are having a difficult time completing the homework, then you should discuss this with your therapist. Together you should be able to develop a plan to get the homework done. Where to Go From Here Over the next several weeks you should work with your therapist to complete several exposures using the guidelines covered in this chapter. The next three chapters cover specific topics that may not apply to everyone. Although we encourage you to read all the chapters in case you come across a technique or Rational Response that seems particularly helpful to you, you and your therapist can dedde which chapters apply the most to your individual circumstances. After you have completed at least three exposures in session and/or as homework assignments, read Chapter 12 on advanced cognitive restructuring and addressing core beliefs. Finally, as you approach the end of the program, read Chapter 13 on consolidating and maintaining your progress. This chapter will help you make the transition from working with your therapist to continuing to make progress on your sodal anXiety on your own. Homework for the Rest of the Program Weekly Exposure Homework As we have noted several times, each week you and your therapist will negotiate a homework assignment for an exposure that you do on your own. You will use the BYOCC worksheet to guide you through this procedure. This homework is an essential part of treatment because it helps assure that the work you do in session translates into the changes you want in your daily life. Self-Monitoring Homework You should also continue the daily self-monitoring that you started in Chapter 4. As you track your progress each week you may notice your average daily anxiety increases in the first few weeks. This increase is most likely to happen if you have been avoiding a lot of situations that caused you anxiety. As you stop avoiding, your anxiety will naturally increase at first. However, as you gain skill with the 137 138 cognitive restructuring procedures and you repeatedly enter feared situations, the anxiety will decrease. You should find yourself entering the situations you are monitoring on the homework more and more frequently. As you keep practicing, the positive benefits will be obvious on the graph summarizing the weekly ratings. Making Overcoming Anxiety Your New Habit Earlier we described social anxiety as something you learned, like a bad habit. The problem with the anxiety habit is that it causes so many missed opportunities and difficulties in your life. Now is the time to start creating a new habit for yourself. We would like you to get in the habit of doing some small thing each and every day to overcome social anxiety. For many people, these will also be the first steps in building relationships with other people. This new habit should help you make faster progress in therapy and generally enrich your life. Here\\'s what we recommend: Think of some small action that you will be able to do nearly every day. This action should involve making contact with another person in a way that is outside of your regular routine. Here are some examples: . 1. Say \"hello\" and one other thing to a person you would not normally speak with. 2. Make one telephone call that you would usually put off for another day because you are anxious about the call. 3. Give someone a compliment when you normally would not say anything. 4. Speak up one extra time in a group of people or at a meeting (good for people whose fears have mostly to do with speaking in front of others). 5. Ask someone an appropriate, non-intrusive question about himself or herself that will help you get to know the person a little better. 6. Make an effort to do some small task when others may be observing, such as pour someone\\'s coffee, put change in a vending machine, unlock a door, drive with someone in the car, write a check rather than pay cash, etc. (good for people who primarily become anxious when doing things while being observed by others). If none of these examples seem to apply to you, work with your therapist to design something similar. As you can see, these are very small gestures that may take only a moment. They may not even make you especially anxious. However, we have found that these types of small, daily exposures help people with social anxiety develop a new habit of reaching out to other people and make facing your fears routine. You might be pleasantly surprised at other people\\'s responses to you. Self-Assessment 1. When working out the order in which to conduct exposures, it is best T F to start with the hardest one so that the rest will be easier. 2. Homework in this program is strictly optional, does not help to link T F therapy to the real world, and is unrelated to your success with this program. 3. It is critical to do exposures for every single situation in which you T F might become anxious. 4. An example of generalization is overcoming fears about talking with T F co-workers which might lead to reduced fear in talking with other students with whom you are working on a group project. S. Noticing that you are anxious in a situation signals that it is time T F to examine your ATs. Answers to Self-Assessment questions can be found in Appendix A. 139  Overcoming Fears of Doing Things in Front of Others The previous chapters covered the core parts of this treatment. Starting with this chapter, we will talk about procedures that are specific to certain types of social anxiety. This chapter will cover fears about performing various activities in front of others. These are known as the specific social phobias. Chapter 10 addresses fears about conversations and making small talk and Chapter 11 is about fears of public speaking. Read each chapter that applies to you. However, even if you do not have a particular fear, you may find helpful information in these chapters or maybe a Rational Response that seems particularly powerful for one of your ownATs. The Original Social Phobia Thirty-five years ago two well-known British psychiatrists, Drs. Isaac Marks and Michael Gelder, described individuals who were looking for treatment for fears about doing specific tasks in front of other people, such as signing one\\'s name, eating, or drinking. Usually the fear was that the person\\'s hand would shake or that he or she would spill the food or drink. These specific fears were the original /I social phobias,\" the old name for social anxiety disorder. As we discussed in the first three chapters, social anxiety disorder is now more broadly defined to include fears of conversations, dating, public speaking, and being assertive. Fears of writing/eating/drinking in front of others are now known as the \"observational fears\" or \"specific social phobias\" to distinguish them from the more pervasive fears of interacting with other people experienced by many persons with social anxiety disorder. It is now known that worrying about being viewed negatively by others is the common thread that runs through all types of social anXiety. The following is a list of observational fears. Some examples appear in parentheses. Make a check mark next to any that apply to you. 141 142 o fear that your hand will shake when signing your name in front of other people (writing a check, signing a credit card slip) o fear that your hand will shake when filling out forms in front of other people (medical forms, insurance paperwork) o fear that your hand will shake when writing on a chalkboard or easel o fear that your hand will shake or you will spill something when eating in front of other people o fear that you will spill or choke when drinking a beverage in front of other people o fear that you will spill when pouring a beverage for someone o fear that you will make errors when typing in front of someone o fear that you will stumble or look odd when walking in front of a crowd (getting on an airplane or bus when others are seated, or walking in front of a crowded theater) o fear that you will make errors when playing a sport (miss the ball when swinging a golf club or tennis racket, throw a wild pitch in softball) o fear that your hand will shake or you will make an error when using any sort of tool or precision instrument in front of others (nurse giving an injection, mechanic using a wrench) o fear that you will make mistakes while driving and this will be noticed by your passengers or other drivers This list is not exhaustive. Almost any task in which you have to do something in a particular way or appear a particular way has the potential to become a specific social phobia. When our clients describe their observational fears, they often describe themselves as being\"self-conscious.\" In other words, they notice that they are paying too much attention to what they are doing. In fact, they are often paying attention to what they must look like to other people. Unfortunately, self-consciousness often produces the very outcome that they fear will happen. Let\\'s look at an example of how this works. Claudia is an expert typist who types well over 100 words per minute. She can type rapidly and accurately because she types whole words rather than individual letters. Instead of typing three letters-a, n, and d-for the word and, Claudia has one motion for the entire word. This motion involves the small finger on her left hand, the index finger of her right hand, and the middle finger of her left hand in rapid succession. If you ask Claudia to think about her fingertips touching each letter on the keyboard, she will probably type much more slowly and make a number of mistakes. Thus, if you ask Claudia to become self-conscious on purpose and observe her own hands as someone else would, she will lose the automatic nature of her expert typing. Somehow thinking about the process of typing interferes with actually doing it. If you know how to touch-type, try this for yourself. Type something while saying the letters aloud and watching your fingers strike each key. You will see that becoming self-conscious makes an automatic task much more difficult. You can also try this experiment with anything at which you are so skilled that you can do it automatically (e.g., playing a musical instrument, throwing or hitting a ball, bowling). All you have to do is slow down and watch each motion as you make it. If Claudia becomes self-conscious about her typing and she also becomes anxious about it, then typing becomes even more difficult for her. The anxiety might cause tension in the muscles in her arms, hands, and fingers, making it even more difficult for her to move her fingers smoothly and rapidly over the correct keys. Being anxious means that her thought processes are focused on ATs such as \"I shouldn\\'t make a mistake\" or III\\'ll look incompetent.\" This makes it harder for her to concentrate on the typing because she is too busy thinking about the ATs. This is the same process that occurs with observational fears. Once you become anxious about doing something such as drinking coffee in front of someone, that anxiety makes it more difficult for you to drink the coffee without shaking or spilling. Eventually you might find yourself avoiding drinking coffee altogether when other people are around. When people who do not have observational fears hear about them for the first time, it is easy to dismiss them as trivial or unimportant. If you experience anxiety in any of these situations, however, you know that it can greatly interfere with your life. Fears about eating or drinking with others can lead to extreme social isolation. Much of the time we spend socializing with others involves meals, having coffee or tea together, or going out for a drink. Your work may involve entertaining clients at dinner or business meetings over lunch. It is very inconvenient to have to pay cash for everything because you cannot write a check or sign a credit card receipt. Imagine the hassle of having to worry about how many groceries you are buying, not because you cannot afford them, but because you only have a certain amount of cash with you. Observational fears may make urinating in a restroom when others are present very difficult or impossible. Individuals with this difficulty may restrict their intake of liquids at work or make decisions about attending events based on whether or not they will be able to avoid using a public restroom for that length of time. Many secretarial or factory jobs have occasions when someone is watching workers as part of a training program or quality control 143 procedures. Offices or other work environments may be open so that co-workers and supervisors are constantly around, potentially observing while individuals work. In addition to the health benefits, sports and recreational activities offer many opportunities for friendships or business contacts. Many people join community softball, tennis, or bowling leagues. Others play in golf tournaments. Anxiety about performing those activities in front of others may lead to avoidance and missed opportunities. As you can see, specific social phobias can have a large impact on a person\\'s life. Common ATs Related to Observational Fear and How to Handle Them Next we will look at some of the ATs that people with observational fears often report. Perhaps some of them will sound familiar to you. We will use the cognitive restructuring skills to categorize and challenge these ATs. We will suggest a situation in which each AT might occur because having a specific context makes them easier to challenge. However, you may have the same AT in a different situation. If necessary, your therapist can help you adapt our suggestions for cognitive restructuring to your particular situation. In each of our examples we list several ATs but focus only on the one that seems to occur for many people. This would not necessarily be the first AT to address dUring the first exposure. Your therapist will gUide you in selecting which ATs to challenge at particular times as certain ATs are easier to challenge later in treatment, once you have completed some exposures. \"My Hand Will Shake\" Miguel is a businessman who travels a lot. In recent years he has become very anxious when haVing to sign credit card receipts because he fears his hand will shake. Because he needs to have a record of his expenses, the accounting office at his company does not want him to use cash. He is particularly anxious when other people are present, especially potential customers. The more he worries about his hand shaking, the more likely it is to shake. This fear often occurs when he has taken a customer out to lunch and must sign the credit card receipt for the bill. Let\\'s look at Miguel\\'s ATs in this specific situation: My hand will shake. The customer will see my hand shake. The customer will think I\\'m incompetent and not give us any business. He indicates that these thoughts make him feel nervous and frustrated. As he notices he is feeling frustrated, he reports one more AT-\"l shouldn\\'t have this problem.\" Because all of the other ATs come from liMy hand will shake,\" let\\'s work on that one. 144 Challenging Miguel\\'s ATs Looking at the List of Thinking Errors, we can classify this thought into several categories. Fortune Telling: Miguel is predicting that his hand will shake at a particular upcoming lunch. That lunch has not yet happened, so he is predicting the future. Overgeneralization: Miguel\\'s hand has sometimes shaken in the past so he draws the sweeping conclusion that it will shake this time (and all other times as well). Mental Filter: Miguel is focusing all of his attention on this one brief eventsigning the credit slip. His concern about this event is crowding out everything else about the lunch and the rest of the meeting with the customer. Looking at the Disputing Question list, we can see some ways to question this thought. Remember it is always important to answer the question raised by the Disputing Question. What evidence do I have that my hand will shake? Miguel answers that on many similar occasions in the past his hand did shake. Since he is already anxious about the situation, it seems likely that his hand will shake this time. However, he has no concrete evidence his hand will shake this time because it has not happened yet! Does my hand shaking last time have to lead to its shaking this time? Miguel answers that it seems to be a pattern that his hand shakes in this situation but it may not shake this time. Perhaps since he has been working on his anxiety he will be able to control it better. What is the worst that could happen ifmy hand does shake? Miguel answers that if his hand shakes a lot, the customer would notice and think something is wrong with him. The customer might think he is on drugs. The customer might have less confidence in him and his company and take his business elsewhere. If this kept happening, Miguel could lose his job. The worst that could happen is that Miguel could lose his job. However, this depends on the customer\\'s seeing his hand shake and drawing a highly negative conclusion about Miguel. How likely is that? Let\\'s use a technique called the \"Pie Chart\" to test out the AT that if Miguel\\'s hand shakes, the customer will think something negative about him. Follow along on the Pie Chart in Figure 9.1 as Miguel answers each question. How likely is it that my hand will shake at this particular lunch meeting? Miguel answers that there is a 90% chance. So there is a 10% chance that his hand will not shake. Locate the 10% slice of the pie labeled \"Not Shake.\" 145 Medication Addict Nervous Incompetent 146 Pie Chart for Miguel\\'s Automatic Thoughts About What a Customer Will Think if his Hand Shakes Ifmy hand does shake, how likely is it that it will shake so much that the customer notices? The fact that the customer might not notice his hand shaking is a new idea for Miguel. As he thinks about it, however, he realizes that sometimes the tremor is so slight that it may not be visible to others. Miguel answers that there is probably a 75% chance that if his hand shakes, it will be severe enough that the customer would notice. That means there is a 25% chance that the customer would not notice. Locate the slice of the pie labeled \"Not Notice\" that represents this 25% chance (of the 90% chance his hand will shake). Does my hand shaking have to lead to the customer\\'s thinking I am incompetent? If not, what else could it mean? Miguel answers that his hand could be shaking for many reasons: because he is nervous because he is tired because he is taking some sort of medication because he is a drug addict because he has some sort of disease that affects the muscles in his hand because he has the flu because he is incompetent Locate the slices of the pie that represent each of these explanations for why his hand could shake in a given situation. As you look at the pie chart you can see that there is about a 33% chance that either his hand will not shake or the customer will not notice it. Miguel believes that either of these would be a good outcome. There is about a 30% chance that his customer would notice his hand shaking and think it was because of something that is negative but not a disaster (being tired, haVing the flu, having a muscular disease, or taking some sort of medication). There is a 25% chance that the customer will simply conclude that he is nervous. Miguel believes that just being thought of as nervous is not as bad as being thought of as incompetent or a drug addict. There is only a 15% chance that the customer will draw the worst conclusions. To summarize, 85% of the time, the customer will not notice or not think too negatively of him (all pie slices except ilAddict\" and \"Incompetent\"), and one out of three times (pie slices of \"Not Notice\" and \"Not Shake\"), it actually will not be a problem. The next step in cognitive restructuring is to develop a Rational Response that summarizes what Miguel learned when he challenged his ATs. Remember, a Rational Response should be shorthand for the most important points of the cognitive restructuring that you want to remember. The Rational Response should also be short and easy to remember so that you can use it in exposures or anytime you encounter the feared situation. Miguel\\'S fear that his hand would shake is based on his concern that the customer will draw a negative conclusion and take his business elsewhere. If Miguel lost a lot of business, he could lose his job. The follOWing Rational Response highlights the fact that Miguel\\'s hand might not shake, the shaking might not be noticed, and noticeable shaking will not necessarily lead to the loss of a customer. Rational Response: Even ifmy hand shakes and the customer notices it, he\\'ll probably still do business with me. Notice how Miguel\\'s definite belief that his hand would shake (that we saw in the original ATs) has now become Ifmy hand shakes. The definite belief that the customer would notice his shaking hands has also become an \"IfII-If. .. the customer notices. Achievable Behavioral Goals and the In-Session Exposure. The next step in cognitive restructuring is to set an achievable behavioral goal. Miguel chose the goal of holding the paper out where it could easily be seen and then continuing to sign his name, even if his hand started to shake. Because signing one\\'s name only takes a few moments, Miguel and his therapist set up 147 the in-session exposure so that he repeatedly interrupted the conversation with the \"customer\" and signed fake credit card slips 30 times. Afterwards they debriefed the exposure by looking at expected and unexpected ATs. Miguel concluded that he learned that he could continue to write no matter what happened. Even if he felt anxious and his hand started to shake, he could think about his Rational Response (\"Even if my hand shakes and the customer notices it, he\\'ll probably still do business with me\"). He was now ready to attempt a similar situation for homework. Using Pie Charts to Challenge ATs The Pie Chart helped Miguel understand that many different things could happen when he has to write in front of a customer. Some of those things are very negative, like being considered a drug addict. Although many of the possible outcomes for the situation are more neutral, he had never really considered them. Finally, the Pie Chart helped Miguel consider the possibility that his hand would not shake or that the customer would not notice a slight tremor. This cognitive restructuring will help him enter the situation with less anxiety. The Rational Response can help keep his anxiety under control while he is with the customer. If Miguel is less anxious, then it is less likely that the muscles in his hand and arm will tense up enough to cause a visible tremor. The Pie Chart can also be used for ATs associated with many other observational fears, induding fears of spilling something, choking on food or a drink, or making a mistake. In fact, you will find the Pie Chart useful any time you have ATs with. Catastrophic Thinking Errors that predict something terribly bad is going to happen when, in reality, there are many possible outcomes. \"I\\'ll Make a Mistake\" Stephanie is in nursing school, and she is approaching the point in her training where she needs to learn to draw blood. She has been told that the students will practice drawing blood from each other before trying it with actual patients. Stephanie becomes extremely nervous when she thinks about draWing blood because it is obvious whether she has done it correctly-the patient either sees the tube filling with blood or not! She has vivid images of poking someone with the needle over and over again and no blood coming out into the tube. She reacts to these images with nausea and a pounding headache. Before starting nursing school, Stephanie had spoken with the nurse at her own physician\\'s office about .her interest in nursing. When the nurse drew blood for routine testing, she commented that many people did not like to have blood drawn so she tried to get it over with as quickly as possible. The nurse then said, IIYou never want to make a mistake when poking a needle in someone\\'s arm.\" Stephanie keeps remembering that statement when she gets anxious. Let\\'s look at Stephanie\\'s ATs about haVing to draw blood from one of her classmates: 148 I\\'I! make a mistake. I\\'I! miss one of the steps in the procedure. Iwon\\'t be able to get any blood. My classmates will think I\\'m incompetent because I can\\'t do this. These ATs make Stephanie feel silly and embarrassed. Since concern over making a mistake is quite common, let\\'s look at the first AT in more detail. Challenging Stephanie\\'s ATs 1\\'1\\'11 make a mistake\" can be classified into several of the Thinking Errors on the list. All-or-Nothing Thinking: When talking with Stephanie, it becomes clear that if she does not do every step of the procedure perfectly, she would see her performance as a failure. Fortune Telling: Stephanie is predicting that she will make a mistake. Since she has not actually tried to draw blood yet, she does not know what will happen. However, unlike most of the Fortune Telling Thinking Errors that we have discussed, this one has a greater chance of being accurate. Since she is learning a new skill, she will probably make some mistakes. However, it is important to consider whether she is likely to make a catastrophic mistake. It is more likely that she will make the mistake of missing the vein the first time than forgetting to remove the needle from the person\\'s arm when she is done. Small mistakes that are part of the learning process are more reasonable (and more possible) than huge mistakes that are potentially dangerous to the patient. Overgeneralization: Stephanie is making a sweeping conclusion that making a mistake will have many disastrous consequences. Not only is she worried that her classmates will think she is incompetent, but if we talked with her further, we would find out that she worries that making mistakes drawing blood means she should not be a nurse. Now let\\'s tum to the Disputing Questions and see if Stephanie can challenge her AT \"I\\'ll make a mistake.\" Do I know for certain that I will make a mistake when I draw blood from my classmates? Stephanie answers that she cannot be 100% sure but that she will probably make a mistake because she has never done this before. Does making a mistake when drawing blood from a classmate have such awful consequences that my entire future resides on it? Stephanie answers that if she cannot learn to draw blood she cannot be a nurse. That is probably true. However, does making a mistake in this particular instance mean that Stephanie cannot be a nurse? Probably not. 149 ~m~...._~_ 150 How likely is it that I will make a serious mistake drawing blood from my classmate that will get me thrown out ofnursing school? Stephanie indicates that the most likely mistake would be to somehow miss the vein so that she has to try several times. She does not think this would get her thrown out of nursing school because it happens sometimes even to experienced nurses. Stephanie realizes that she would have to do something very serious to be removed from school for not drawing blood properly. It would have to be something outrageous, such as poking the needle in her classmate\\'s eye on purpose. Not surprisingly, Stephanie thinks that such an event is extremely unlikely to occur. Is making mistakes a normal part oflearning a new skill? Stephanie answers that yes, making mistakes is a normal part of learning something new. In fact, she is able to identify several skills she has already learned in nursing school. While she made a number of mistakes at first, she was later able to perform correctly. She is able to say that that is the reason she and her fellow nursing students often practice on each other before trying the procedures on real patients. The most important thing is to learn from the mistakes and improve. Stephanie summarizes these ideas into the following Rational Response: Making mistakes is part oflearning something new. Notice that this Rational Response addresses the All-or-Nothing Thinking in Stephanie\\'s AT \"I\\'ll make a mistake.\" It encourages her to stop thinking in terms of being perfect. Instead, the Rational Response encourages her to recognize that mistakes are a normal and expected part of learning. Achievable Behavioral Goals and the Exposure It would not be appropriate to have Stephanie actually draw blood during her therapy session, as this should only be done under appropriate supervision. However, she could do everything except actually sticking the needle into someone\\'s arm. To make it more realistic, she brings all of the necessary equipment to session, although the syringe does not have a needle. She sets IIGoing through all of the steps in the procedure to draw blood (except the actual needle stick)\" as the achievable behavioral goal. Afterwards Stephanie and her therapist debrief the exposure. Focusing on her Rational Response seemed to help control her anxiety when she had the expected AT \"1\\'11 make a mistake.\" When asked to summarize what she had learned from the exposure, Stephanie indicates that she knew she would be very unlikely to make a dangerous mistake and she would need to go easy on herself for making the normal mistakes that come with learning. She is now ready to use her cognitive skills to prepare for an upcoming nursing class during which the students will draw blood from each other. General Strategies to Address Fears of Making Mistakes In this example we worked on fears of making mistakes when learning something new. Often people with observational fears worry about making mistakes doing something that they know well. Making mistakes may be part of learning, but Stubbing my toe I once you become more experienced, mistakes are less expected. Notice that we said \"less expected,\" not \"mistakes should not happen.\" \"Mistakes should not happen\" is a Should Statement that can be very destructive. If we are expert at something or it is part of our job, it is easy to have the expectation that we can do it well every time. However, if you think about it, that is not very realistic. Any sports fan can tell you that even the most expert professional can make a mistake at a crucial moment. Consider the field goal kicker who misses the winning 30-yard field goal in the final seconds of a playoff game. Part of the excitement of watching sports is that the outcome is unpredictable because any player can play better or worse than usual on any given play. In fact, it is clear that mistakes are part of the human condition. In the vast majority of situations where the consequences of a mistake are serious, there is a back-up plan if a mistake occurs. In situations where mistakes could be disastrous, such as a pilot landing a passenger jet, the pilot has the co-pilots and many safety systems that warn him or her if a mistake is being made. Manufactured products are inspected and tested to assure that a mistake has not occurred in production. These warning systems, inspections, and evaluations can be thought of as \"safety nets\" in case something goes wrong or someone makes a mistake. There is no safety net for the sad ballplayer described above whose mistake cost his team the championship. That is because the consequences of this kind of mistake are not that serious. The players and the team may lose money and prestige but no one will die. Part of the challenge of sports is for players to test themselves against the opposition, recogniZing that sometimes they will win but sometimes they will lose. Batting records in baseball are an excellent example of this principle. Abaseball player who has a .400 batting average will certainly go to the Hall of Fame. However, a .400 average means that the player only hits the ball four out of ten times at bat. More often than not, the player makes an \"out\"! If your AT is \"I\\'ll make a mistake\" in a situation in which you have a lot of experience, ask yourself if there is a \"safety net\" if you do so. If there is, then reminding yourself of the safety net may make an excellent Rational Response. If there is not, then ask yourself how serious the consequences of making this mistake really are. Watch out for Emotional Reasoning here. The consequences may \"feel\" very serious. Here is an exercise that might help you put the consequences in perspective: On the left end of the folloWing line, identify something that could happen to you that would be unpleasant but not very serious. As an example we will fill in \"stubbing my toe.\" All ofmy family killed I 151 On the other end, fill in the absolutely worst thing that could happen to you. For most people, this is something like finding out that everyone in their family had been killed in a car accident. We filled this in on the right. Now put a mark on the line that indicates how serious the consequences would be for the mistake you are worried about making. We\\'ll fill it in for the football player who missed the winning field goal. Stubbing my toe I Missing winning field goal I All ofmy family killed I As you can see, missing the winning field goal was far more serious than stubbing his toe, but compared to losing all of his family, it was not that serious. Now consider where you placed the mark for the mistake that worries you. How serious is that mistake when you consider everything that is important to you? Try to develop a Rational Response that reminds you of the more realistic view of the seriousness of making a mistake. Here are some examples that our clirnts have used: If happens, it will be unpleasant, but I can live through it. Even if happens, I still have the most important thing in lifemy family. Exposures for Observational Fears As we discussed in previous chapters, the exact exposures that you will complete with your therapist or as homework must be highly individualized. Everyone with social anxiety experiences the anxiety somewhat differently from situation to situation so there is no one set of exposures that should be completed by everyone. We will describe some exposures we have often used when working with individuals with observational fears. Some may apply to you, some may not. The order in which you complete the exposures will depend on what makes a situation easier or harder for you. Some exposure situations are very brief. For example, signing your name to a credit card slip takes only a few seconds. It is best for exposures to last long enough for your anxiety to habituate (peak and start to decrease). For very short situations, this may mean setting up an artificial exposure in which you sign your name repeatedly. Your therapist can help you work this out. We offer some suggestions here on how to do exposures for these very brief feared situations for homework. 152 Eating in Front of Others lf you become anxious when eating with other people, start to look for situations in your life in which you could choose to dine with someone or at least in the presence of other people. Here are some examples: Dine inside the fast-food restaurant rather than using the drive-through window. Eat at a deli rather than picking up something to take home. Invite co-workers, relatives, or friends to join you for Happy Hour, lunch, dinner, or Sunday brunch either in your home or at a restaurant. Choose items to eat that you find more anxiety-provoking. Eat with chopsticks at Asian restaurants. Create extra opportunities for eating with others by bringing food to share with co-workers, family, or friends at occasions when food would be appropriate but not necessarily present. Go to restaurants when they are more or less crowded-whichever is more difficult for you. Drinking in Front of Others Many of the suggestions for exposures to eating in front of others also apply here. Again, look for occasions to have a beverage whenever other people are around. Although eating may not be appropriate in some circumstances (such as a formal business meeting), having a bottle of water or a cup of coffee is acceptable in most situations. Carry something to drink with you whenever possible. Take any opportunity to drink when others are present. Stop at a fast-food restaurant or coffee shop and have your drink inside rather than getting something to go. lf you are a member of a church, try to take communion whenever possible. Remove the straw from a drink (or use one if that is more anxiety-provoking). Choose beverages (or types of containers) that you find more difficult to drink (or drink from) whenever possible. Invite co-workers, friends, or family to join you on occasions in which beverages will be served, such as meals, Happy Hour, etc. Take breaks at work with others and drink something. Be sure to order extra beverages when dining out, such as haVing a beverage and water with the dinner and coffee after dinner to prOVide more opportunities to practice. 153 154 Writing in Front of Others In a society that relies more on credit and debit cards than cash, it is easy to find opportunities to sign your name in front of others. There are also many opportunities to write checks rather than pay cash. Although most people try to avoid extra paperwork, there are many opportunities to fill out forms when others are watching if you need to find them. Here are some examples of exposures to address fears of writing in front of others: Write a check or use a credit card rather than paying cash whenever possible. \" Do not start writing the check until it is your turn to check out at a store. Although people behind you in line may prefer that you have your check ready to go, some people do not start searching for their checkbook until they get the total from the cashier! Taking a little extra time is acceptable and can help you work on your anxiety. Be sure to fill out the complete check and all of the details in your check register in front of everyone. Go inside the bank rather than using the drive-through window or the automatic teller machine. Go to banks and stores at the busiest time. Volunteer to take the minutes at a meeting. Volunteer to write on the chalkboard or easel during a meeting or class. If you are making a presentation, try to write on a chalkboard or easel whenever possible. If there is more than one place to pay for items in a store, pay for part of your items in each place, using a check or credit card each time. Do your grocery shopping by purchasing a few items at several different stores, writing a check each time. Use a gas station where you can pay by credit card to a cashier rather than just SWiping your card at the pump. Remember that your goal is not to be an efficient shopper for now. The goal is to find as many opportunities as possible to expose yourself to the situations you fear and to practice using your Rational Responses and disputing skills as you do so. Fears Of Making Mistakes Sometimes people who have a specific social phobia about making mistakes find that they only become anxious in one or two particular situations. As with the nursing student described, these situations are often related to work or school. Fears of making mistakes during sports or exercise are also included here. Regardless of your primary feared situation(s), we have found that it is often helpful to put yourself in situations in which your performance will frequently fall short of perfect. Since none of us are perfect, sometimes we just need to work on making our errors a bit more public. Be sure to set your observable behavioral goal as \"making a mistake and staying in the situation anyway.II Since you are likely to make mistakes when learning something new, take on a new hobby or sport, particularly one that is taught in a class. Possibilities include instrumental or vocal music lessons, sports lessons (tennis, golf, etc.), dance classes, drawing or painting classes, arts and crafts classes, or woodworking classes. Take your dog to obedience classes. Even if you do everything right, your pet is likely to refuse your direction from time to time! Join a community sports team. Make harmless mistakes on purpose. Volunteer to read something aloud in a meeting and stumble over your words occasionally, pay for something with \"exact change\" but be over or under by a few cents, etc. Play games in which you are likely to make errors, such as trivia games or charades. If you are worried about spilling things, have a friend or family member help you by holding a glass while you pour in water. Deliberately pour in too much water so the glass overflows. Using water from a companion\\'s glass in a restaurant, deliberately pour extra water into your own glass so it is difficult to drink without spilling a little. Repeatedly take a drink. Summary In this chapter we have discussed several common observational fears and some cognitive restructuring exercises and possible exposures to address them. Many of these will be helpful for more general fears of having conversations as well. With some creativity and the assistance of your therapist, you should be able to design exposures to address your fears, even if the particular situations arise infrequently. Homework We described examples of exposures that could be done both within the session and as homework assignments for exposure in your daily life. Each week you and your therapist will negotiate a homework assignment to assure that you are applying the skills you are learning. As always, be careful to use the BYOCC worksheet to guide your homework assignment so that you work through each step of the cognitive skills. 155 156 Self-Assessment 1. As opposed to the original social phobias, social anxiety disorder T F now includes fears of conversations, dating, public speaking, and assertion, in addition to signing one\\'s name, eating with others, and drinking in public. 2. Once you become anxious about performing a task, the anxiety T F makes the task even more difficult to complete. 3. Using a pie chart can help you see that there are many possible T F outcomes to a situation, including some chance that other people won\\'t notice your anxiety. 4. It is reasonable to think that if you are an expert at something then T F you will perform perfectly every time. 5. Exposures work best if they last long enough for anxiety to get T F to its peak, and then they should be discontinued. Answers to Self-Assessment questions can be found in Appendix A. Big Fears ofSmall Talk I don\\'t know what to say. I\\'m not very good at making conversation. We won\\'t have anything to talk about. I never have anything interesting to say. She\\'ll think I\\'m boring. He won\\'t be interested in what I have to say. Do these ATs sound familiar to you? Many people who have difficulty with social anxiety worry about what to say in casual conversations. Aseemingly minor encounter} such as exchanging a few words with a store clerk or neighbor, can result in anxiety for many people with social anxiety disorder. In this chapter we will explore why it is important to be able to make casual conversation. Then we will examine some of the ATs that socially anxious individuals often have in casual conversation and how to challenge those ATs. The Big Impact of Small Talk Most people with social anxiety tell us that they hate small talk. However, it is as necessary to life as food and water. Let\\'s define IIsmall talk\" as the short casual conversations that people have with friends, family, acquaintances and strangers about superficial or impersonal topics. Some examples of small talk include: Complimenting the neighbor on the beautiful flowers on her patio when you see her out watering as you leave for work Asking a co-worker whether he or she did anything fun over the weekend 157 158 Commenting to the desk clerk at the health club that the club seems fairly quiet today Commenting to someone while waiting for the instructor to arrive that the class is interesting but more work than you had expected it to be Striking up a conversation with a sales clerk by asking whether he or she has heard if the weather will be warm this weekend As you can see from the examples, none of these conversations are about imporw . tant topics. In fact, when we have clients pay attention to what people discuss when they are making small talk, clients usually are amazed at how !IsmaIl\" the talk is. Small talk is usually about very trivial topics. The weather is a favorite topic for casual conversations, which rarely cover major world events or great philow sophical issues. By focusing on more trivial subjects or events the two people might have in common (such as, !lDid you see that story in the news about that little kid getting stuck in the well?\"), casual conversations provide the !lgrease\" for people to become acquainted or just to pass the time by making contact with others. If they encounter each other frequently, then a more serious friendship or relationship might evolve. More serious or emotionally significant conversations at the right time lead to closer relationships. However, the first step in any friendship or relationship is making small talk. Small Talk Begins Relationships Anumber of years ago social psychologist Donn Byrne studied how people choose potential friends and marriage partners. He looked at a number of possible factors, including having something in common with the person and being physically attractive. Although these factors were important in picking friends and partners, another very important factor was something he called !lpropinquity\" (pro-PINw qui-tee), meaning !lnearness\" or !lproximity.\" In Professor Byrne\\'s research, he found that he could determine which people would become friends in a college classroom simply by assigning them to sit near each other. After a few weeks of sitting in the same nearby seats, students would become acquainted through casual conversations and, in some cases, develop friendships or dating relationships. In other studies, he found similar patterns of friendship development among neighbors. The old adage that we often marry the boy or girl next door is true, simply because they are nearby and we see them frequently. If you have been socially anxious for a long time, you might not have any friends, or maybe only one or two people with whom you do things. You might have arranged your life so that you do not have to taIk with anyone, so it may be difficult to meet new people who could become friends or dating partners. Prow fessor Byrne\\'s research and the work of other researchers suggests that there are two factors involved in developing friendships-you need to be around people on a regular basis and you need to start casual conversations so you can get acquainted. Before we talk about how to achieve these goals, let\\'s discuss why it is important to have relationships with other people. Social Support Networks Family and friends form what is known as a \"social support network.\" Aperson\\'s social support network is the group of people that can be counted on to listen, offer advice, provide help, and db things together. Some people like to have a large network with lots of friends, family, and acquaintances, and they confide easily in one another. Other people prefer only a handful of friends and family members who are close and mutually supportive. If your social support network is too small or you do not have close relationships with the people in it, then you are likely to feel lonely and isolated. This often happens to people with social anxiety because their anxiety has interfered with their ability to make close friendships or develop romantic relationships. An inadequate social support network can have many consequences for a person beyond feeling lonely and isolated. Many scientific studies over the last 2S years have found that social support seems to act like a buffer against the stresses in life. People with good social support networks have better physical and mental health, recover from surgery and illness faster, and may live longer than people with inadequate social support networks. Friends and family in a social support network may do things that are helpful like fixing a car or bringing chicken soup when you have the flu. Friends and family also provide emotional support by listening to your frustrations with a supervisor or reminding you that you are loved by sending a birthday card. As you can see, there are many good reasons to invest time and energy in developing a social support network that meets your needs. Now let\\'s turn to a quick inventory of how you feel about your social support network. Examining Your Social Support Network Figure 10.1 is a form entitled \"Your Social Support Network.\" Take a few moments now to answer the questions. Count the number of different names you listed in response to the three questions. If a name appears on more than one question, count it only once. There is no \"right\" answer. Different people are comfortable with networks of different sizes. However, if you listed only one or two different names, your network is small. Most people would probably prefer to count on more than one or two people. On the other hand, it is hard to have close relationships with many people. If you listed 10 or more names, ask yourself how close you really are to some of the people. Consider the folloWing questions: 1. Are you surprised about the number of people in your network? Why or why not? 2. Do you feel that your network is the right size for you? Would you like to have more people who are close to you? 159 Your Social Support Network 1. List the first names of everyone in whom you can confide about the things that are really important to you. 2. List the first names of everyone on whom you can count if you need help with something. 3. List the first names of everyone to whom you could turn for emotional support or advice if something bad happened to you, such as losing your job or finding out you had a serious illness. Copyright  2000 by Graywind Publications Incorporated 160 If you are like most people with social anxiety disorder, particularly those who get anxious in casual conversations, your social support network is probably lacking, either because there are too few people or the relationships are too superficial. It may be time to consider how to enlarge your network. Common ATs for Casual Conversations As we saw at the beginning of this chapter, certain ATs are commonly reported by people who have fears of casual conversations. We will look at the potential Thinking Errors in each of these thoughts and consider some ways of disputing the ATs. \"I Won\\'t Know What to Say\" Kay is considering whether to start a conversation with her co-worker Kim. As Kay starts to get anxious anticipating the conversation, she finds herself thinking, \"I won\\'t know what to say.\" Next we will see how she could challenge this AT. What Thinking Errors might be in the thought, I won\\'t know what to say? Fortune Telling: Kay is making a prediction that she won\\'t know what to say before the conversation actually happens. Disqualifying the Positive: If Kay has things she could talk about but she has dismissed them as silly or uninteresting, then this thought would be an example of Disqualifying the Positive. She would be disqualifying what she has to say, thereby maintaining her belief that she has nothing to say in casual conversations. Kay can use the Disputing Questions to challenge this AT. What follows is the dialogue that Kay might have with herself. Anxious Kay: Coping Kay: Anxious: Kay: Coping Kay: Anxious Kay: I won\\'t know what to say. What evidence do you have that you won\\'t know what to say? When I think about going up to Kim and talking to her, I am unsure ab()ut what I should say. Are you 100% certain that you do not have any ideas at all regarding what you could talk about with Kim? I guess I would just start with \"Hello, how are you?\" first. 161 Coping Kay: Anxious Kay: Coping Kay: AnxIous lay: Coping lay: Anxious IBy: Coping IBY: That\\'s a good start. What else could you say after that? I could ask her about her weekend, whether she did anything fun. Do you think she might then ask you about something, maybe what you did this wee,kend? Jtls possible she might ask me something. If not, I could just tell her about the movie I saw on Saturday. So what is the evidence that you won\\'t know what to say to Kim? None. I guess there are a few things I could say. So a Rational Response to the AT III won\\'t know what to sat\\' might be \"I can say hello and talk about our weekends/\\' 162 It is rarely the case that a person has lio idea of what to say in a casual conversation. Everyone can say, \"Hello, how are your Then it only takes one or two more topics to carry the conversation further. Doing the cognitive restructuring before starting the casual conversation will help challenge the AT III won\\'t know what to say/\\' The cognitive work also has the added benefit of providing an opportunity to think of potential topics before the conversation begins. Kay now has a plan to greet Kim, ask about her weekend, and tell her about the movie she saw. This plan could easily become her achievable behavioral goal of accomplishing these three tasks. She can enter this conversation fully armed for success. Very often ATs about not knOWing what to say in casual conversations come from underlying\\'ATs such as \"I never have anything interesting to say/\\' People with social anxiety may have difficulty finding conversation topics because they dismiss many everyday topics in their search for topics that are interesting or entertaining. \"I\\'m Not Very Good at Making Conversation\" Many people with social anxiety disorder believe that they do not have the skills to make conversation. When they first go to see a therapist or counselor, these individuals state that they do not know how to act or what to say in social situations. They may say that they do not know how to make small talk. In the language of psychologists, many socially anxious people believe they have poor social skills. Socially anxious people talk about their poor social skills so much that many psychologists believe them. Some of the earliest treatments for social anxiety disorder were social skills training programs. These programs included instruction and practice in what to say in different situations as well as feedback on how loud your voice is, how to make the right amount of eye contact, and so forth. These programs were fairly helpful for many people. However, in the 1980s, psychologists started to notice that many, if not most, people with social anxiety disorder did not have poor social skills. In fact, observations of individuals with social anXiety in various situations suggested that although they frequently felt anxious and uncomfortable, they actually performed just fine. Sometimes their anxiety would distract them or interfere with what they were doing but it seemed clear that most individuals with social anxiety disorder had adequate (and often excellent) social skills. Thoughts such as \"I\\'m not very good at making conversation\" were actually Thinking Errors for many people with social anxiety. Let\\'s take a look at an example. Alejandro is very anxious about the upcoming office Christmas Party. He dreads going every year but believes that it is important to go because the boss seems to make a mental note of who does and does not attend. Although Alejandro usually becomes very anxious talking with people, he gets along OK at work because the conversations seem to have a purpose and are generally about work-related topiCS. People listen to him because they are exchanging information that they both need. When anticipating the party, Alejandro imagines himself standing in a group of people totally silent. He has some ideas about what he could say but he does not know how to break in. He may laugh along with the jokes but he does not really participate in the conversation. The situation feels hopelessly awkward and Alejandro says to himself, \"I\\'m not very good at making conversation. Other people seem to know how to take their turns and the conversation flows back and forth.\" Let\\'s look at Alejandro\\'s AT of \"I\\'m not very good at making conversation.II First we will examine the Thinking Errors in Alejandro\\'s AT. Labeling: Alejandro is labeling himself \"poor conversationalist\" (or more honestly, perhaps, \"too stupid to know how to talk to people\"). He seems to see himself as fitting into a category of people that have a serious flaw-not knowing how to make conversation. Overgeneralizing: Alejandro is using the situations in which he had trouble with conversations in the past to draw the conclusion that he will have trouble this time. Disqualifying the Positive: Alejandro is disqualifying the conversations about work that he has every day. He seems to have the skills to carryon those conversations. Probably some of the skills are relevant to conversations at aparty. Let\\'s look at some cognitive restructuring that Alejandro might do for himself. 163 164 Anxious Alejandro: I\\'m not very good at making conversations. Coping Alejandro: What evidence do you have that you are not very good at making conversations? Anxious Alejandro: I am always miserable at these Christmas parties and usually end up standing off by myself or sticking very close to my wife all evening. Coping Alejandro: Is there any other reason-besides a lack of social skills-that you could feel miserable at the Christmas party? Anxious Alejandro: I\\'m embarrassed about what people will think if I am standing off by myself but my wife worries about me if I hang around her all night. Coping Alejandro: So it sounds like at least part of feeling miserable might be due to thoughts about what people will think if you stand by yourself. Another part might be due to thoughts about your wife\\'s reaction if you stay with her too much. Anxious Alejandro: Right. Coping Alejandro: It sounds like your thought about your social skills is only one of the ATs that might be making you feel miserable at the party. I\\'m wondering if you are feeling so miserable that you do not actually attempt to talk with very many people. Anxious Alejandro: I usually try a few times. I start a conversation, then after a few exchanges, the person does not seem to have much to say so I excuse myself and move on, feeling like I failed. Coping Alejandro: Are there any other possible reasons, besides your lack of social skills, that the other person might not continue to talk? Anxious Alejandro: I guess some of them might be shy and not have much to say. Maybe they see someone they want to talk with. Some people try to use these parties to make points with their supervisor or the big boss by chatting with them. Coping Alejandro: So it sounds like some people might cut the conversation short for reasons that have nothing to do with you. Anxious Alejandro: Yes, I guess that is true. It takes two people to have a conversation. If they don\\'t stick around there isn\\'tmuch I can do. Coping Alejandro: You\\'re right. It does take two people to have a conversation. What percentage of the conversation are you responsible for? AIIxlous Alejandro: I guess I\\'m only responsible for half and the other person is responsible for half. As with many people with social anxiety, Alejandro did not have much evidence of the terrible social skills he thought he possessed. There were several reasons why he might be feeling uncomfortable at the party, including worrying about what his wife and other people thought of him. Also, he had been putting a lot of pressure on himself to carry the conversation. It is important to remember that if the other person does not want to talk, there is not much you can do about it. Agood Rational Response for him might be, III only have to do my half\" or IIPm only responsible for 50% of the conversation.\" If he is less worried about keeping the conversation going, Alejandro should be able to be more spontaneous and better able to think of things to say. Penny: Fear of Casual Conversations Now that we have examined how to challenge some of the common ATs socially anxious individuals have about casual conversations, we will look at a case example that describes a series of exposures for overcoming these fears. This will allow you to see how a series of cognitive restructurings and exposures for fears of casual conversations can build on each other across treatment sessions. Penny is 25-year-old single woman who works at a day care center. She came to treatment because she was feeling very socially isolated and had no close friends. The few friends she had from high school had all moved away or gotten married. She had not had a date in over a year. Penny stated that her primary problem was her inability to get acquainted with people. Whenever she considered starting a conversation with a stranger, she felt tongue-tied and did not know what to say. At work she was so busy with the children that she did not talk very much with the other three women who worked there. She was able to talk with the parents about the children as they came and went in the morning and evening but she kept those conversations as short as possible. Penny\\'s goal in therapy was to become more comfortable meeting new people. Penny participated in group therapy for social anxiety disorder. After working on cognitive skills in the first couple of sessions, it was time for Penny\\'s first exposure. Penny and her therapist agreed that the first step in meeting new people was to make initial contact by saying \"hello.\" They decided to do an in-session exposure in which Penny would approach each member of the group indiVidually, offer a 165 166 greeting, and say one other thing. One of Penny\\'s ATs in anticipation of this exposure was \"1\\'11 be so nervous I won\\'t even be able to get the words out.\" When she considered this thought, she felt humiliated and incompetent. With the group\\'s help, Penny identified the Thinking Errors in this AT as two forms of Catastrophizing. Fortune Telling described her prediction, not based on evidence, that something bad will happen. She was also catastrophizing that the anxiety would be so severe that she would not be able to say even one or two sentences. Using the Disputing Question \"How likely is it that I won\\'t be able to talk at al1?\" Penny decided that there was no more than a 25% chance that she would not be able to talk at all. The rest of the group thought 25% was high but it seemed about right to Penny. Because a 25% chance of not being able to talk means there is a 75% chance she will be able to talk, Penny agreed to try the Rational Response I/More than likely I will be able to talk.\" Her achievable behavioral goal was to get at least one word out to each person. With the therapist and group members standing in a circle to serve as role-play partners, Penny went around the group three times saying \"Hello\" or \"Good Evening\" and one other thing to each person, such as \"How are you?\" or lilt\\'s good to see you again.\" Her SUDS rating quickly went up to 85 as she was,very anxious but slowly came down to about 60 as she completed the third time around. Not surprisingly, Penny was able to talk with each person three times despite high anXiety, easily meeting her achievable behavioral goal. As she noticed the exercise was going OK, she felt her anxiety start to decrease. After this success, Penny agreed to approach three people she would not normally talk with during the week and say hello and one other thing. Her therapist emphasized the importance of completing the BYOCC worksheet prior to the homework so she could be fully prepared to cope with any anxiety that occurred. Penny reported back the next session that she was able to complete her homework with the anxiety being no worse than a SUDS rating of 45 the third time. However, she did notice that it was hard to find people to talk with because she had become so isolated. At the therapist\\'s suggestion she agreed to check into adult education classes at the community college as a way to meet new people who might have common interests. She eventually selected an 8week photography class because she had always wanted to learn more about taking photos. For her second in-session exposure, Penny had a brief conversation with an acquaintance. One of the other group members who became anxious when speaking in public, not in conversations, served as the role-play partner. Penny\\'s primary AT before the exposure was \"Having conversations is a normal, everyday experience. I shouldn\\'t be anxious about it.\" She felt angry at herself for being anxious. The primary Thinking Error was identified as a Should Statement. After some discussion, Penny was able to ask herself whether it was really so important or consequential that she was anxious about conversations when most other people were not anxious in this situation. With the group\\'s help, Penny concluded that everyone has their own difficulties and comparing herself to others is not very helpful. The most important thing is that she was working to overcome her fears. Thus, her Rational Response was \"Everyone has their own problems, and I\\'m working on mine.\" Penny\\'s achievable behavioral goal for the exposure was to stay in the conversation until her therapist stopped it. Penny was very anxious at the beginning of the conversation and her SUDS rating reached 95 when she seemed to run out of things to say after the first few exchanges. However, the two soon found a topic they had in common, and the conversation proceeded fairly smoothly. Penny\\'s SUDS rating in the final minute was 40. After the conversation, Penny initially felt that she had failed because the conversation had not gone well at first. She said that this was when she usually found an excuse to stop talking and leave. After being reminded that her behavioral goal was simply to stay in the situation, she was able to give herself some credit for doing so. Also, she had learned that, even though they went through a few moments with nothing to say, the conversation became easier when they found a common topic. For homework, Penny agreed to try to start at least two brief conversations (three or four exchanges) with people in her photography class. She reported back the next week that these conversations had gone well and that people were friendlier than she expected them to be. Over the next several weeks, Penny continued to practice conversations anywhere she could. She made an effort to speak more with her co-workers and the parents who came to pick up or drop off their children. She had found another single woman her age in the photography class, and they had talked several times. Something had been said about trying to go to the park together and take some photos on the weekend but it had not happened yet. When the therapist suggested that such an outing would be a logical next step, Penny indicated that it made her very nervous but she agreed to do an in-session exposure to this situation. After some discussion, Penny reported the AT, \"When she gets to know me, she won\\'t like me.\" After identifying this AT as Mind Reading and Catastrophizing, Penny was asked what evidence she had to support her prediction. Penny replied that she had a lot of personal problems, just like the rest of her family. She described her father as an alcoholic who had sometimes become violent when she was growing up. When asked to specify what\"a lot of personal problems\" meant for her, the only one Penny could list was the social anXiety disorder. The therapist and group members pointed out that this is an example of Mental Filter in which her social anxiety and father\\'s drinking problem had colored her entire view of herself. Penny asked herself the Disputing Question, \"Do my father\\'s drinking and my social anXiety have to lead to my classmate\\'s not liking me?\" The group members were able to offer evidence that they had gotten to know her quite well and found her to be a warm, caring person. By not letting people get to know her, Penny had until now missed out on learning that other people would like her and enjoy her company. Out of this discussion, Penny developed the Rational Response, \"The past is the past; I\\'m becoming a different person now.\" 167 Penny\\'s goal for the role play was to share something personal about herself, because it became clear that she had been avoiding moving beyond the most superficial conversation. With one of the group members acting as the woman from the photography class, Penny revealed that she had joined the class to meet people as well as learn about photography. She had found it hard to meet people since leaving high school. Penny was less anxious during the role play than she had expected to be. Her peak SUDS rating was only SO. She agreed to try and arrange an outing with the woman from her class for the upcoming weekend. It took a couple of weeks for Penny and her classmate to get together on the weekend but Penny reported that they both seemed to have a good time. They discovered they liked similar movies and had plans to see a new movie during the following week. In this case, we can see that Penny\\'s fears of casual conversations had prevented her from developing friendships and a social life. Initially her fears related to not being able to carryon casual conversations. However, it became apparent later in treatment that Penny was also fearful of more serious conversations in which she and another person would get to know one another more intimately. This fear came from longstanding beliefs about being unacceptable because of the secrecy and chaos of her alcoholic home. This case also illustrates something that we have often found to be true when working with socially anxious people who fear casual conversations. Once people start to greet others and initiate conversations, other people usually respond positively. Those casual contacts with people eventually become an enjoyable and anticipated part of daily life. Afew of the casual contacts lead to more significant friendships over time. While it is true that not all casual conversations lead to relationships, certainly all friendships and romantic relationships started with some casual conversation! Homework We described examples of exposures related to fears of conversations that could be done both within the session and as homework assignments for exposure in your daily life. Each week you and your therapist will negotiate a homework assignment to assure that you are applying your new skills. As always, be careful to use the BYOCC worksheet to guide your homework assignment so that you work through each step of the cognitive skills.

Over 90% report at least some fear about speaking in front of a group and, for most of those individuals, the fear is moderate or severe. Not everyone who fears speaking in public seeks treatment to overcome the fear. Many find that they can easily avoid making speeches at their job or in their personal lives without great difficulty. Most socially anxious individuals come to treatment for fears about other situations such as conversations, dating, or being assertive, even though public speaking may be their most feared situation, because these other fears typically cause much more interference in their lives. Often these same individuals are able to make excellent progress on their fears of public speaking after they have addressed their most urgent concerns. However, for about one out of six people we have treated over the years, fears about speaking in front of groups is the sole reason for seeking treatment. When someone thinks about public speaking, usually the image that comes to mind is of standing on a stage in front of hundreds of people making a formal speech. We have all seen someone do this, from the guest speaker at a graduation to the politician seeking votes. However, there are many other forms of public speaking that most people confront much more frequently. Imagine yourself in the following situations and check off the ones that would make you anxious: o telling a joke to a group of people who are sitting around talking o standing up in a community meeting (such as a neighborhood association or a school meeting for parents) to comment on an issue you care about 171 o serving as the chairperson for a committee meeting at work or a community organization o reading sCriptures or offering a prayer aloud during a religious service o offering a eulogy at a funeral of someone you knew o making a toast at a wedding reception or other celebration o telling a story of an interesting experience to a group of people o speaking up at a self-help group or twelve-step meeting o introducing someone who is going to make a speech o giving a report during a meeting o teaching a class or explaining how to do something to a group of people o making a few comments at an important occasion such as after receiving an award, at your wedding, or at a retirement party o being called on to answer a question in a class o making a presentation in a class As you can see, there are many more opportunities to speak in front of a group of people than most of us might think. Many of these situations can be less anxiety- provoking than a formal public speech. These situations offer opportunities to work on speaking fears on a more gradual basis, so you do not have to work on the most difficult kind of speech first. We will now describe two clients who sought relief from anxiety about speaking in public. In the first case, we will illustrate how you can start with easier situations and work up to harder ones. In the second, we will describe how to address public speaking fears when the anxiety occurs only in a particular situation that is infrequent but very important. For both examples, we will provide some ideas about how to tackle common ATs about public speaking. Tom: From Computer Jock to Public Speaker Tom was a 46-year-old man who sought treatment for fears about making presentations at work. Tom had worked in the computer department of the same large company for about 20 years, starting as a programmer who mostly worked alone or with others in small groups. Over the years he had become more involved with training new employees to use the computers, usually on a one-on-one basis. Recently, the company had converted to a new computer system, and Tom\\'s supervisor wanted him to be in charge of training the sales staff. This would involve running training classes of 10-15 people and, occasionally, making 112 presentations at managerial meetings on the status of the conversion. Both of these situations made Tom very anxious. He even thought about changing jobs because he feared he would not be able to carry them off. When Tom developed his Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy with his therapist, it became obvious that there were a number of situations involving speaking in front of a group that made him anxious. Looking at Tom\\'s Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy in Figure ILl, you can see that speaking in front of groups in both formal settings (such as a presentation to managers) and informal settings (such as telling a humorous story at a party) produced anxiety for Tom. Using the 0-100 scales for SUDS and Avoidance, he gave lower Avoidance Ratings for teaching the class because he felt that this was something that he could not avoid-he would just have to \"suffer through somehow.\" Tom thought that the first day of the three-day class would be the hardest because he worried about making a good impression. If the first day went well, the other two days would cause him less anxiety. After learning the basic cognitive restructuring skills, Tom and his therapist decided to make situation 7 on his Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy-telling a humorous story at a Friday afternoon get-together with familiar co-workers-the topiC of the first exposure. They planned to practice with an in-session exposure, then Tom could try the real situation for homework. When Tom\\'s therapist asked him to imagine being out with his co-workers and telling a funny story about something that had happened to him recently, Tom reported the following ATs: I\\'ll be very anxious. I\\'ll freeze up so much that I won\\'t be able to finish. They will see I\\'m nervous. Tom felt very nervous when he considered these thoughts. The second thought caused Tom the greatest concern, so he and his therapist focused on analyzing it. Looking over the list of Thinking Errors, Tom saw that he had engaged in All-orNothing Thinking in that he imagined one of two extremes-either being fine or freezing up so much that he could not continue. He had not considered that he might freeze up a little bit but then be able to go on. This AT also contained aspects of Fortune Telling because he predicted ahead of time that he would freeze up and not be able to go on without considering other possible outcomes. After talking more about what Tom meant by freezing up, he and his therapist also identified Emotional Reasoning in the AT. When Tom started to feel himself getting anxious and tense, he had a sensation of being unable to move or speak. However, just because he felt that way did not mean that he actually was frozen. In fact, he sometimes had been amazed that he was able to continue despite the anxiety and tension. Tom challenged the AT \"I\\'ll freeze up so much I won\\'t be able to finish\" using the Disputing Questions. He asked himself, /lDo I know for certain that I will freeze 173 Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy Subjective Units of Discomfort Scale (SUDS) o 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 no anxiety, mild anxiety, moderate anxiety, severe anxiety, very severe anxiety, calm, relaxed alert, able to cope some trouble concentrating thoughts of leaving worst ever experienced Avoidance Rating o 5 W ~ ~ H H n 40 ~ ~ \" 60 B n ~ 80 M \" \" ~ never avoid avoid once in awhile avoid sometimes usually avoid always avoid Situation SUDS Avoidance #1 most difficult situation is presenfafion fo managers /00 /00 #2 most difficult situation is ar91lin9 a c,onfroversial poinf af a c,ommllntty meefin9-sfanain9 af my seaf /00 /00 #3 most difficult situation is lirsf aay feac,hin9 in frainin9 session lor new c,ompllfer sysfem q8 50 #4 most difficult situation is alfer lirsf aay feac,hin9 in frainin9 session lor new c,ompllfer sysfem 85 20 #5 most difficult situation is fellin9 a hllmorolls sfory af work party wifh 9rollP 01 c,o-workers ana sllpervisors 80 q5 #6 most difficult situation is makin9 a lew priel c,ommenfs in a meefin9 wl!h people I know-sfanain9 af my seaf 70 80 #7 most difficult situation is fellin~ a hllmorolls sfory af Friaay alfernoon gef-f0ge her wIth c,o-workers (00 q5 I know well #8 most difficult situation is askin9 nexf-aoor nei9hpor fo refllrn somefhin9 he has porrowea 50 50 #9 most difficult situation is speakin9 IIp af small aepartmenfal meefin9s af work 50 25 #10 most difficult situation is fellin9 a Illnny sfory fo several lamily mempers 20 0 \", ,~igure11.1.,> Tom\\'s Sample Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy 174 up and not be able to finish?\" and \"What is the likelihood that 1won\\'t be able to finish even if 1do freeze up a little?\" to look at whether he was overestimating the probability of his AT\\'s coming true. After concluding that there was no more than a 20% chance that he would freeze up and not be able to continue, his therapist asked, \"What\\'s the worst that can happen if you do freeze up and can\\'t continue?\" Thinking about that possibility made Tom very anxious, but he was able to remember a couple of other times when he had seen people forget the punch line of a joke or lose their train of thought during a story. These situations were uncomfortable and somewhat embarrassing, but both times the person had just made a joke about getting old and everyone had laughed it off. Tom concluded that it would not be the end of the world if he did freeze up and could not finish the story. The cognitive restructuring work resulted in the Rational Response uI\\'ll probably be able to finish. II After all, there was no more than a 20% chance he would freeze up and not be able to finish. Tom\\'s therapist suspected that the 20% was a high estimate since it had only happened to Tom once many years ago and he had avoided telling stories in a group since then. His avoidance had deprived Tom of the opportunity to find out if he would be able to finish. Tom and his therapist established the achievable behavioral goal of \"Start telling the story and stay in the situation whether you finish the story or freeze up. II Tom, his therapist, and another therapist from the same office then role played sitting around talking after work on a Friday. They talked for about 10 minutes, dUring which Tom told a humorous story about getting stuck on his roof when the wind blew his ladder down while he was making repairs. He became quite anxious, with a peak SUDS rating of 85, but was able to finish the story despite the anxiety. When debriefing the exposure, Tom indicated that he had felt that he was going to freeze up at one point dUring the story, but he had taken a deep breath and used his Rational Response uI\\'ll probably be able to finish. II That had eased his anxiety enough that he was able to continue. He had accomplished his goal of starting the story and staying in the situation whether he was able to finish the story or not. When asked what he had learned from the experience, Tom mentioned two things. First, he had noticed that starting the story was the hardest part and it became easier as he went along. Second, even if he was feeling very anxious, it was unlikely that he would not be able to continue. For homework, the therapist and Tom agreed that he would try to tell the same story to his co-workers the next Friday after work. Tom would use the BYOCC worksheet to prepare for the exposure and set the same behavioral goal about starting the story and staying in the situation. The next week Tom reported back that he had been very anxious but was able to complete the story. Everyone had laughed, so he felt it must have gone fairly well. Over the next few weeks, Tom and his therapist worked on several exposures related to teaching the computer training classes. Tom brought in the prepared 175 176 materials and practiced different segments of the class, including introducing himself and the goals of the class the first day and answering questions. One AT kept coming up over and over: \"They won\\'t understand because I won\\'t explain things well enough.\" The therapist broke the AT into two separate thoughts, I\\'They won\\'t understand\" and \"I won\\'t explain things well enough.\" Lees look at how they challenged each of these ATs. Tom and his therapist identified the Thinking Errors in the first AT liThey won\\'t understand\" as Overgeneralization (one person not understanding means everyone does not understand; not understanding one part means that none of the material is understood) and Mind Reading (assuming the class did not understand even though they were not asking questions to indicate confusion). The Disputing Question that Tom found most useful for this thought was, \"Could there be any other explanations for their lack of understanding?\" They made a list of all of the reasons that people might not understand, other than a poor explanation from Tom. Someone might not understand because he or she might ... not be listening have their mind on something else not be smart enough not have enough background/training in computers not want to learn the new system be looking for another job so he or she does not care to learn not learn well with Tom\\'s style of instruction need more time and hands-on instruction After thinking about the last item in the list, Tom remembered that part of the plan was to provide individual instruction once everyone had learned the basic material. This led Tom to consider that he might be setting his standards for how much they should understand too high, because it was generally assumed that most people would need additional training before they would be able to understand the many new concepts he would be teaching them. Once Tom had challenged the first AT, the second thought, til won\\'t explain things well enough\" became less important. He was confident that he could use the prepared materials to give people a good introduction. Once he adjusted to a more reasonable standard of what people should know, he became more confident that he could teach to that level. Tom summarized all of this cognitive work for himself in the Rational Response iiI just have to give them a general overview. Most are going to need more instruction no matter what I do.\" After his in-session exposures, Tom was able to use his cognitive self.help skills to manage his anxiety in the real-life classroom. He gradually became less anxious about teaching, and he actually began to enjoy it. Anumber of people commented on how helpful the classes were to them. Acouple of times his explanations became too technical, but the students asked questions indicating their confusion. This made him a little anxious, but he was able to recover and move on. Tom\\'s final challenge was the presentation at the managerial meeting about how the transition to the new computer system was progressing. Despite his successes, he felt very anxious every time he thought of the upcoming meeting. At the end of his therapy session one week, Tom agreed to prepare his presentation and bring it to the next session. They would then use the presentation as an in-session exposure. Tom arrived at the next session without the prepared presentation materials. He indicated that he had become anxious every time he sat down to prepare so he kept putting it off. The therapist described Tom\\'s failure to prepare as avoidance behavior. Tom had felt anxious and, instead of using the cognitive skills to cope with his anxiety and face his fears, he had avoided the feared situation. When Tom and his therapist examined the ATs that had led to the avoidance, his primary AT was IIThey\\'ll ask a question I can\\'t answer.\" When his therapist helped him explore that thought further, Tom indicated that if he were not able to answer the managers\\' questions, he would look incompetent. The underlying AT was \"They will think I am incompetent if I can\\'t answer their questions.\" This concern interfered with Tom\\'s ability to prepare for the presentation because he could not decide what information he needed to have ready. Tom and his therapist identified the Thinking Errors in this AT as Mind Reading (making assumptions about what the managers will think), Catastrophizing (imagining that there would be a lot of questions that he would not be able to answer), and Labeling (calling himself \"incompetent\" because he sometimes had doubts about whether he really knew enough to do his job). Using the Disputing Questions, Tom asked himself whether he was 100% certain the managers would ask questions he could not answer. He concluded he was not 100% certain and, in fact, no one knew his job better than he did. In response to the Disputing Question \"Does not knowing the answer mean I am incompetent?\" Tom was able to identify a number of things he did well on his job and noted that he had usually received good evaluations. This helped him argue against being incompetent. However, if there was something he did not know that he should have known, the best he could do was promise to find the answer as soon as possible. This led to the Rational Response, \"I know my job. All I can do is promise to find out if I don\\'t know the answer to a question./I After his cognitive restructuring work, Tom was able to prepare his presentation, using the BYOCC worksheet to cope with the anxiety he felt. He practiced the presentation in the therapy session and then did it for the managers. The achievable behavioral goal he set for the actual presentation was to just get himself there 177 178 and get through it. Tom felt very anxious as he was waiting for his turn to present, but he had written the Rational Response on his notes, and it helped him stay in the room. There were a couple of questions that took him by surprise, but he felt he handled them adequately. Although Tom thought that he would always be somewhat anxious in this situation, he believed he would be able to handle it and knew it would get easier over time. What to Take from the Case of Tom Tom\\'s experience overcoming his fears of public speaking is typical of many people with whom we have worked. If you have similar fears, you might have recognized one or more of his ATs. I\\'ll freeze up so much Iwon\\'t be able to finish. Iwon\\'t explain things well enough so they won\\'t understand. They will ask questions Ican\\'t answer. We highlighted these ATs because they seem to come up so often for people with public speaking fears. Many people report that they worry about getting so anxious they will not be able to finish the speech. Some even describe images of themselves running out of the room because they cannot continue. One way to tackle ATs with this general theme is to look at the likelihood of such an extreme response, as we did with Tom. Almost always such extreme reactions are not that likely to occur-that is part of what makes them extreme (and thus unusual) reactions. You might find it helpful to consider all of the possible outcomes using the Pie Chart technique we described for Miguel in Chapter 9. The purpose of public speaking is to communicate a message, and many presentations are supposed to teach new information. In these cases, individuals with public speaking fears often express ATs about not communicating clearly. Once it has been determined that the material to be presented is appropriate and wellwritten, then it may be helpful to think about how much people can realistically learn. We have often found that anxious presenters set very high standards about what people should learn from their presentations and then feel inadequate when that standard is not achieved. If you are able to set a more appropriate goal for what you will communicate, as Tom did, you might be surprised at your success. In-session exposures offer an excellent opportunity to ask questions of the audience to see what they learned from a presentation. Sometimes people feel fairly confident about a speech for which they are able to prepare in advance. However, haVing to think on their feet in response to questions may be much more anXiety-provoking. Like Tom, this anxiety may occur in response to an underlying belief about not being as competent or smart as you might appear to be in the prepared speech. Addressing ATs about difficult questions often focuses on two points. First, consider what you know about the topic compared to what the audience knows. Second, develop a plan for what to do if you get a question you cannot answer on the spot. Depending on the situation that plan might include simply admitting you do not know and asking if the questioner or anyone else in the room has an idea, promising to get back with the answer later, or requesting that the questioner rephrase/clarify the question so you have a moment to gather your thoughts. Whatever plan you choose, it is helpful to have one in mind so you know what to do if the need arises. Avoidance of preparing for the speech is extremely common among people with public speaking fears. In fact, when they are very anxious, people sometimes avoid preparing for so long that they have to cancel the talk at the last minute because they are not ready. It is easy to see how this can be a recipe for failure as a public speaker. If you are feeling anxious about preparing for a speech, that is a signal to get out a BYOCC worksheet and work on the thoughts that are driving your anxiety. Then you can use the Rational Response and achievable behavioral goal to help yourself prepare. If your anxiety is high, you may not be able to work on the speech for very long at a time. Instead of avoiding, however, you should work on the speech in short bursts. Set a dock for 10 or 15 minutes and allow yourself to stop and relax after the time is up. You should do your best to work for the full interval rather than quitting when your anxiety rises. That escape from anxiety will only make it worse. Remember that the reduction in anxiety from escape or avoidance only makes it more likely you will avoid or escape again next time. LeAnn: The Overly Prepared Vice President Tom\\'s case represents a common type of public speaking anxiety in which the person is fearful of a range of situations related to speaking and being the center of attention. Sometimes public speaking anxiety is very focused on a particular situation, however, usually one that occurs infrequently. LeAnn was a highly successful vice president of a medium-sized company when she came to treatment for very severe anxiety she experienced during a yearly speech at the company\\'s annual sales meeting. At that meeting, she was expected to make a formal presentation to about 150 salespeople and managers that highlighted some of the successes and challenges of the previous year and set goals for the upcoming year. She had made the speech in two previous years and felt more terrified as each occasion approached. LeAnn felt the fear was odd because she regularly made speeches in many other situations as part of her job and her involvement in community activities. She had overcome most of her public speaking anxiety in those situations, experiencing only a little anticipatory anxiety right before she stood up. As LeAnn learned the basic cognitive self-help skills, her therapist helped her identify the ATs that she had about the speech. Repeatedly, LeAnn said that her worst fear was that she would look nervous. The therapist helped her explore further, revealing the follOWing ATs: 179 180 I\\'ll appear nervous. I shouldn\\'t be nervous in this situation. It is unacceptable for a woman in my professional position to appear nervous in front of a large group of people below me in the company hierarchy. If I get more prepared, I\\'ll be less nervous. When LeAnn and her therapist began to identify the Thinking Errors in the ATs, they tentatively labeled the first AT as Fortune Telling because she was predicting what would happen at this year\\'s speech. Although there was no way to know for sure, both LeAnn and her therapist agreed that there was a realistic possibility that she might appear nervous. Acouple of people had commented last year that she looked nervous and she was even more anxious about the speech this year. When they tried to explore how much nervousness would be acceptable to show, LeAnn was adamant that it was unacceptable to show any nervousness at all. This meant they would have to address the third AT that it was unacceptable for a woman in her professional position to show any nervousness in this situation. LeAnn\\'s therapist thought this AT contained several Thinking Errors. First and foremost, it was a Should Statement. /lIt is unacceptable to be nervous\" is a more extreme form of /II shouldn\\'t be nervous,\" the previous AT. It implies that LeAnn is violating an important rule. This AT was also an extreme form of All-or-Nothing Thinking in that there were two categories in LeAnn\\'s mind-No Visible Anxiety (the good/acceptable category) and Any Visible Anxiety (the bad/unacceptable category). When they began to challenge this AT with the Disputing Questions, LeAnn had difficulty accepting anything other than displaying no anxiety. She felt that showing nervousness was the worst thing that was likely to happen but that this would be terrible because she was supposed to set an example for the other employees at the meeting. Her speech was supposed to highlight their successes and inspire them to achieve even more the next year. It was also supposed to be entertaining. As the only woman vice president with a mostly male sales staff, she believed the standard for her performance was very high. Her therapist made more progress with the Disputing Question /lIs this so important that your entire future rests on it?\" LeAnn felt it might influence how she was perceived in the company. The nervousness could be seen as a sign of weakness. However, at worst this might influence her future professional opportunities somewhat but it would not affect the many other things that were important in her life such as her family and her health. LeAnn and her therapist concluded that they could not predict whether she would show nervousness at the upcoming speech but that it might be helpful to act as if LeAnn could not control it entirely. This led to the Rational Response, /II have to accept that I might look a little nervous but that doesn\\'t affect any of the really important things in my life.\" As LeAnn and her therapist began to set up in-session exposures to practice the speech, the last AT, \"If I get more prepared, I\\'ll be less nervous,\" came up. LeAnn indicated that she usually began to work on this speech weeks in advance and spent many hours editing the wording and practicing her delivery in front of the mirror. She agreed with the therapist that she prepared excessively as a strategy to help her cope with her anxiety. Unfortunately, the opposite turned out to be the case. The more she prepared, the more anxious she became. By trying to make everything perfect, she was not able to be herself in the same way she could with other speeches and presentations. Her AT was not just distorted, it was wrong! LeAnn agreed that the best exposure would be to not work on the speech too much. She and her therapist worked out a schedule that included reasonable preparation time for the speech, but they agreed that she should limit the amount of time devoted to editing and updating it. Any other time she felt like working on the speech, she agreed to work on identifying and challenging the ATs that were giving her the urge to over-prepare. LeAnn\\'s behavioral goal for the speech was to limit her preparation on the day of the speech to no more than 20 minutes. She also wrote an abbreviated version of the Rational Response, \"The most important things are safe/\\' at the top of each page of her speech to remind herself that showing nervousness might have some impact on her professional life but not on all of the other important things in her life. By limiting her preparation time and getting some perspective on the importance of her performance, the speech was not the overwhelmingly negative experience it had been in previous years. She did experience quite a bit of anxiety but doubted it was noticeable. She was able to congratulate herself for getting through the speech. What to Take From the Case of LeAnn LeAnn\\'s situation illustrates one of the more difficult public speaking fears to treat-a situation that occurs infrequently. As you know, repeatedly facing your fears is one of the most powerful weapons in the battle against anxiety. The repeated exposure probably helped her overcome any anxiety she had in other public speaking situations. In dealing with infrequent situations, it is important to look for any aspects that can be addressed repeatedly. LeAnn\\'s excessive overpreparation offered an opportunity to expose herself to her fear, and by making a contract with her therapist to limit her preparation time, she was able to do so. Sometimes, it may help to give the speech to a smaller audience even though this may not generate much anxiety. Another option is to practice the speech repeatedly in your imagination. This is called \"imaginal exposure.\" Often you or your therapist can make an audiotape describing the experience of the speech that you can use for guided imagery. For Tom, public speaking anxiety led to avoidance of preparation. For LeAnn, the opposite was true. As with most things in life, moderation is the best recommendation on the amount of preparation you should do. Look carefully to see if the preparation and planning for your public speaking is anxiety-provoking and 181 whether you try to avoid it or repeatedly put it off. If so, then prepare more and use the cognitive self-help skills to address the anxiety. If your preparation is itself the result of an AT and is an unhelpful attempt to manage your anxiety, then limit your preparation and use the extra time to help yourself with cognitive restructuring work. As we noted at the beginning of this chapter, public speaking makes most people nervous. It may be that, at least at first, you will have to learn to accept some level of anxiety, especially if you speak only occasionally. You may not really have enough opportunities to overcome the fear. Like LeAnn, you may find it helpful to step back and think about how important that anxiety really is in the broader scheme of your life. Many people find that as they are able to accept that they will experience some anxiety while speaking in public, it becomes less painful and less important. Those are good first steps towards having the anxiety be less of a problem. Homework Throughout this chapter we have mentioned various ways to practice speaking in front of a group. With Tom, we saw that one can take opportunities to speak up in informal social situations. You can also participate in community or religious organizations and take advantage of opportunities to speak there. Many people have found one organization extremely helpful both in overcoming their fears of public speaking and developing their skills as an effective speaker. This organization is Toastmasters International, a group for people interested in becoming better speakers. Most cities and towns have one or more chapters. The meetings vary widely but all offer opportunities to make speeches of many kinds and get feedback from the group. Check the telephone directory or call local colleges, universities, or the Chamber of Commerce to find a chapter in your area. . Sei:f-Assessment 1.

Answers to Self-Assessment questions can be found in Appendix A. 183  Advanced Cognitive Restructuring: Addressing Core Beliefs Over the last several chapters, we have focused on identifying and challenging the ATs that you experience in the situations that have typically made you anxious. We hope you now understand how changing your thoughts helps control your anxiety. You have also learned that avoidance of the situations that you fear prevents you from learning that your catastrophic thoughts do not come true. In this chapter we delve deeper into your ATs and examine some of the beliefs you have about yourself, other people, the world, and the future that underlie your ATs. Looking for Common Themes in Your ATs Take out the BYOCC worksheets that you have been using over the past several weeks. Also gather any other worksheets or records you have of your ATs across various situations. Do you see any patterns in your ATs? Are there any thoughts that keep coming up over and over again? Do some or all of the ATs have a common theme running through them? In the next few pages, we will discuss how to find the important themes in your thoughts and how to begin to change those that cause you difficulty. Although most people find that they need the help of their therapist to explore their core beliefs, reading this section will help you understand the process. Experienced cognitive therapists have noticed that people who have difficulty with anxiety (and depression) usually have one or more dysfunctional core beliefs about themselves, other people, the world, or the future. Therapists often talk about finding these core beliefs by searching through the layers of ATs and emo tions, similar to the process of peeling an onion. As you peel away each layer, you can see another layer below. Even though the layers underneath have always been there, you may not be able to see them until you remove the outer layers. In the same way, when you first begin to monitor your thoughts, you notice the ATs that are \"on the surface.\" These are the ATs that come to your mind first. Usually these 185 are more superficial and may be relatively easier to talk about with your therapist. As you have been conducting the exposures and challenging your ATs, you have probably discovered some ATs that you did not know about at first. These may feel a little more personal and may have been harder to talk about with your therapist. Maybe your therapist bas had to help you think through your thoughts to peel away some of the superfidallayers so you can talk about the ATs in the layers underneath. In this chapter, we will help you peel away even more layers and try to see the core of your psychological onion! Danielle: \"I should do everything perfectly\" Let\\'s start with several examples of common core beliefs to help you understand what we are talking about. First, let\\'s visit with Danielle. Danielle had been making excellent progress in treatment for her fears about talking with authority figures and being the center of attention. The primary situations she had been working on included conversations with her supervisor and speaking up in a group of people. . Numerous ATs had been identified but two carne up over and over again in various forms. These two were: I\\'ll make a mistake. I should do a good job. Danielle feared making various mistakes, including stumbling over her words in conversation, losing her train of thought, making an error on a work assignment, telling her supervisor the wrong information, and making some sort of sodal error like forgetting someone\\'s name. Her worries about not doing a good job meant that she worked extra hard on every assignment at work, inclUding working after hours without getting paid for it. Through the cognitive restructuring exercises, she had begun to understand that all evidence suggested that her work was very good. She also had watched other people and seen that small difficulties in conversations, such as losing one\\'s train of thought, happened to everyone. Other people did not seem as concerned about such errors as she was. Danielle\\'s therapist helped her peel away the layers to see the core belief underlying her primary ATs. therapist: When you think about making mistakes or not doing a good job, what other thoughts do you have? Danlelle: I think that a person should always try and do a good job, should try to not make mistakes. I feel awful when I make a mistake. It means I should have tried harder. therapist: Tell me more about feeling awful. 186 Danlelle: I hate that feeling. When I know I have messed something up, I sometimes get a sinking feeling in my stomach. It can just be a little thing like stumbling over my words when I am talking to the group as we sit and have coffee before work. I feel even worse if it is something important. I used to be upset for days if my supervisor asked me to do something over or do it differently. I would get mad at myself because I should have done it right the first time. I still feel this way sometimes, even though I try to challenge my negative thoughts. Therapist: So one thought you have is, \"I should do things right the first time.\" It is important to you to do little and big things right the first time. What does it JiIlean to do things \"right?\" What is \"right?\" Danlelle: Well, \"right\" is \"right.\" It is the correct way to do it, the best way to do something. Therapist: So doing something \"right\" means doing it the very best way, perfectly the first time, every time? Danlelle: I guess it does. I never thought of it that way. Therapist: How does it feel when you think about needing to do everything perfectly the first time, every time? Danlelle: I feel overwhelmed and frustrated. I try so hard but I just cannot do it. I should be able to do better but I cannot. I guess I feel a little angry also. I feel angry that other people don\\'t seem to care so much. One woman at work makes lots of mistakes. I end up redoing her work sometimes. But she doesn\\'t seem to care. Even though I think my supervisor appreciates that my work is so much better than hers, she does not seem to care what he thinks. I\\'m not sure it\\'s worth trying to do everything right. I feel frustrated just talking about it. Therapist: What would happen if you did something less than perfect on purpose? Danlelle: I don\\'t know. That would be hard. I would be very uncomfortable. It seems like it would be breaking the rules. You are supposed to try to do everything perfectly. Therapist: So the rule is \"You should do everything perfectly.\" Danlelle: Yes. I guess that is a Should Statement, though. That means it must be a Thinking Error. It feels like it is true. I have always believed that. \"Feeling true\" probably means that it\\'s Emotional Reasoning. Therapist: Do you remember anyone ever telling you that you needed to do things \"right\" or \"perfectly\"? 187 188 DaRlene: Oh yeah. My dad used to have a saying, \"If you aren\\'t going to do it right, don\\'t do it.\" therapist: With all due respect to your dad, do you see any of the Thinking Errors in IIIf you aren\\'t going to do it right, don\\'t do it\"? Daniel..: It seems like AllorNothing Thinking. Either you do something perfectly, or you do not even try. There is no middle ground. Therapist: Exactly. No wonder you sometimes feel overwhelmed and frustrated. That is a high standard to set. Can you think of some other situations in which you feel pressured to do something perfectly? Any other times you have the thought, IIIf I\\'m not going to do it right, I shouldn\\'t do it\"? Danlene: You know I hate trying new things that I might not be good at. Remember when everyone from work was going to participate in that charity golf tournament? I was very anxious and ended up calling in sick that day. I knew that I would probably hit the ball into the water or something embarrassing. Afterwards I heard that other people who had never golfed before did just that. I was glad I did not go but I felt bad that I did not help raise money. I knew I would not be able to hit the ball very well so I didn\\'t feel that I could go. I could not do it perfectly, so I did not even try. therapist: What do you think your dad meant to communicate to you when he said, IIIf you aren\\'t going to do it right, don\\'t do it\"? Danlelle: I\\'ve never thought about that. I think he wanted all of his children to do well, to be successful at things. I know he believed that if you work hard, you can get the things you want in life. To some extent he was right. Alot of good things have happened to me because I work hard and do things well. I am proud of having a reputation of being a person you can count on to get the job done. therapist: It does sound like following your Dad\\'s philosophy has worked well for you in many ways. However, it seems like there are ways in which it has not worked as well for you. Danlene: Yes, I think I have taken it too far. I would like to believe that sometimes it is OK to do something Ilwell enough\" rather than \"perfectly right.\" That would take a lot of pressure off. Therapist: That sounds like something we can work on with exposures. We can have you try doing something \"well enough\" on purpose and see how it goes. I suspect you would get more comfortable with practice. As you can see from this example, Danielle\\'s two common ATs, \"I\\'ll make a mistake\" and \"I should do a good job,\" related to a core belief about needing to do everything perfectly. This dysfunctional core belief influenced how Danielle approached a wide range of situations. If she is able to change her dysfunctional core belief, Danielle will have more helpful thoughts as she enters situations that make her anxious. As a result, she should experience less anxiety and less pressure to perform perfectly. That will help her at work with her supervisor and in social interactions. She will also be able to try new things that she may not be able to do well at first. The therapist used several strategies to help Danielle peel away the layers of ATs and emotions to reveal her core belief. These strategies included: 1. Asking what other thoughts came to mind as Danielle thought about the ATs. One AT usually leads to others. As you start to think about your ATs and follow one to the next, you will often work towards ATs that are more important and come up in many situations. 2. Asking Danielle to describe what certain key aspects of her ATs meant (what does \"right\" mean?). ATs are usually so automatic that we do not stop to consider what they actually mean. By trying to define certain key words, we can begin to expand the ATs and can more easily identify the underlying assumptions we are making. 3. Asking Damelle to focus on the emotions she experienced when she thought about her ATs. Feeling upset or emotional is one of the best signs that you and your therapist are starting to identify your core belief. As you allow yourself to experience that emotion and consider what it feels like, more ATs will usually come to mind. You have probably experienced this already when completing the BYOCC worksheets. The unexpected ATs that you record on the back of the BYOCC worksheets probably come to the surface when you are anxious. Allowing yourself to experience the emotion can be difficult because none of us wants to feel sad, angry, or frightened. However, as you have learned in exposures, the fear increases at first but then decreases if you stay in the situation. Other emotions work the same way. If you let yourself feel sad or angry, the feelings will increase in intensity then decrease as you fully experience them. 4. Asking Danielle what would happen if her ATs came true (What would happen if you did something less than perfectly?). This is another way to follow the chain of ATs from one to the other. Very often we have worked so hard at keeping the ATs from coming true that we have never considered what it would mean if they did. If you find yourself working hard at avoiding something (like not being perfect, for Danielle), then there is a good chance that what you are avoiding is related to your core belief. 189 s. Asking Danielle to identify the source of her ATs as it seemed like they were getting close to a core belief. Very often a core belief is something that we learned early in life about our selves, the way the world works, what we can expect from other people, and whom and what we can trust. These things we learn function like \"rules\" for life that tell us what we should do and what to expect from others. In social anxiety disorder, these rules often relate to whether or not other people are trustworthy, whether one is a worthwhile person, or how we should conduct ourselves. It is important to note that you may not have any notion of the source of your core belief or that what you remember might not be accurate. That is OK. There is no reason to think that you have to understand what happened in your past that resulted in your core belief. You can still work to change your dysfunctional beliefeven ifyou do not know where it came from. Sometimes thinking about where a core belief came from may help you identify it more clearly but knowing the source is not essential for making changes. Individuals with social anxiety disorder often have a core belief about the need to be perfect, as we saw with Danielle. There are some other common core beliefs that we have explored with our clients over the years. We will share how some other clients worked with their therapists to peel away the layers to address their core beliefs. Brent: \"If People Really Knew Me...\" Brent is a 27year-old man with severe dating anxiety. At the beginning of treatment he had never been on a date with a woman and became quite anxious having conversations with potential dating partners. He experienced very little anxiety in other situations and ran a fairly successful lawn care business. The primary places he met women he could date were his health club and his singles bowling league. Since starting treatment he had completed several exposures in which he had conversations with women in both of those settings. These conversations seemed to go well and the next step was to ask one of the women on a date. The previous week Brent had had an extended conversation with an attractive woman at his health club. They had started to talk about movies they wanted to see and it seemed the next logical step would be to invite her to a movie. Brent was feeling extremely anxious about taking that next step despite haVing been very successful in previous exposures. Brent\\'s therapist was helping him explore the ATs that were causing his anxiety. Brent kept coming back to one AT, IIShe won\\'t want to go out with me,\" which he identified as Fortune Telling. Using the Disputing Questions, Brent\\'s therapist encouraged him to look for evidence to support his AT. Brent agreed that there was no evidence that she would not go out with him. In fact, he had preViously predicted that women would not even want to talk with him and that had turned out not to be true. As they talked further,it became clear that Brent believed the 190 conversations on a date would be more personal than the casual conversations he had had previously. This discussion revealed ATs such as I/I\\'m not very good at talking about myself\" and//I won\\'t know what to say./I As Brent and his therapist further discussed his concerns about not knowing what to say, Brent was able to list several things about himself that would be appropriate to discuss, including his work, his family, and where he grew up. It was not that he did not know what to say, but that he was uncomfortable talking about these personal things with someone else. Brent\\'s therapist asked what he thought would happen if he discussed these topics with his date. With much hesitation, Brent finally admitted that he thought he really liked this woman, but he feared that if she really got to know him, she would not like him. Brent did not believe that there was something wrong with him. He just believed that he was very ordinary. As he put it, he had not been a star football player in high school, he did not make a lot of money, and he did not have a prestigious job. In short, he had never done anything interesting or spectacular. Brent feared that he was so ordinary that when anyone found that out, there would not be anything about him to like. Brent and his therapist agreed that his core belief was IIIt people really knew me, they wouldn\\'t like me.\" Once the core belief had been identified, Brent and his therapist treated it like any other AT. Brent agreed to try and gather evidence to see if his belief was true. He and his therapist made of list of things that his date might like about him, things that might make him special in some way. Looking at this list, Brent developed the following Rational Response: //There are some things about me that I can be proud of.\" He used this Rational Response to challenge his ATs and asked the woman from his health club to a movie. As with the previous conversations, the date went better than Brent expected and with each success he felt less anxious and more confident. Because he had never before taken the risk to let someone get to know him, he had never had the opportunity to find out whether people would like him or not. Arlene: \"I\\'m an Imposter\" Arlene was a 44-year-old married woman with two children. She was a successful attorney who sought treatment because she had recently begun to get extremely anxious when she had to meet with important clients. Sometimes in conferences that included these clients and other attorneys, she experienced panic attacks and had to step out of the room. She felt that the anxiety was beginning to interfere with her job. Over the years she had occasionally experienced social anxiety on job interviews, at work, and when meeting with her children\\'s teachers or her husband\\'s boss, but as she had become more and more successful at work, the anxiety had intensified. Arlene was extremely concerned about an upcoming negotiation meeting in which she would have to be very assertive on behalf of her client. When asked to imagine herself in that situation, Arlene told her therapist that she could look around the room and see everyone in their expensive suits looking very self-assured. Her AT was that she did not belong in that room with 191 192 those people. Arlene identified Emotional Reasoning (\"Just because I don\\'t feel comfortable here does not mean I don\\'t belong/l) and Disqualifying the Positive (discounting all of her credentials, education, and prior successes) as the Thinking Errors in that AT. With the help of her therapist, Arlene made two lists: Evidence She Should Be Participating in the Meeting and Evidence She Should NOT Be Participating in the Meeting. The first list was quite long, and the second list had nothing on it. Still Arlene seemed stuck on the AT \\'II shouldn\\'t be in this meeting./I Her therapist asked whether anyone else thought she should not be there. Arlene hesitated but then indicated that anyone who knew her in high school would be shocked to see her now. With her therapist\\'s encouragement, Arlene shared that in junior high school she had been very wild, skipping school, drinking alcohol, and smoking marijuana. She became sexually active at a young age and had become pregnant. Her parents were furious when they found out, and it was agreed that she would go live with her oldest sister and her husband in a nearby town and give the baby up for adoption. Arlene recounted that during the pregnancy and long talks with her sister, she had decided that she did not like the direction her life was going. After the birth of the baby, she moved back with her parents and went to a different school. She became very serious about her schoolwork, took a parttime job, and did very little socializing. One success led to another, and she went on to law school, marriage, and children. No one, induding her husband, knew about her wild background, but Arlene felt very ashamed of it. The pregnancy was never discussed in her family. Arlene lived in constant fear that someday the adopted child would turn up on her doorstep. Arlene\\'s core belief was, \"I\\'m an imposter. I don\\'t deserve to be where I am in life. Someday people will find out and I\\'ll lose everything./I Arlene and her therapist identified three primary Thinking Errors in the core belief: Mental Filter, because she allowed the mistakes of her youth to color her entire view of herself and her life; Labeling, because she called herself an \"imposter/l and undeserving of her family, job, and social position; and Mind Reading, because she assumed that everyone would reject her if they found out her secret. Arlene agreed to work with her therapist to test the belief \"I\\'m an imposter. t1 This involved several steps: 1. Acknowledging that her activities in her youth were a less important part of who she was now than everything she had done for the last 30 years. 2. Telling her husband about the previous pregnancy. 3. Talking with her parents and her sister about what had happened in the past and how she felt about it. 4. Starting to do some volunteer work with pregnant teenagers. Arlene decided not to tell anyone at work about her past because she decided her past was private and not related to her work performance. Each of these steps was very anxietyprovoking. Arlene used the cognitive skills she had learned in treatment to help cope with the anxiety these activities caused and treated each situation like an exposure, working from the easiest to the hardest step. Facing her fears about exposing her secret helped change her thoughts about not belonging and being an imposter at work. By discu~sing her past with appropriate people, including her therapist, Arlene also discovered that her prediction about people\\'s negative reactions did not come true. Rather than condemning her mistakes, people admired her strength for having gotten herself onto the right path in high school. Discovering Your Core Beliefs In the stories of Danielle, Brent, and Arlene, we have tried to share some of the common core beliefs that we have seen in our work with people with social anxiety disorder. These three themes are: I have to do everything perfectly. If people really knew me, they wouldn\\'t like me. I\\'m an imposter. There is something wrong with me/l have done something wrong. As you examine your ATs, you may find other themes or core beliefs. You may also find that some of these themes combine. For example, people may believe they have to do everything perfectly so others do not discover they are imposters. By sharing these examples we hope to help you understand the importance of exploring your ATs in depth and being honest with yourself and your therapist about your thoughts and feelings. Peeling Your Own Onion In Figure 12.1 you will find a worksheet entitled \"Peeling Your OnionDiscovering and Challenging Your Core Beliefs.\" If you have not yet started with your therapist to explore your core beliefs, this worksheet will help get you started. Asample completed worksheet for Danielle, the first client we described in this chapter, appears in Figure 12.2. Not All Core Beliefs are Hard to Find The case examples in this chapter offer fairly dramatic portrayals of core beliefs. If your social anxiety is less severe or you experience it in very few situations, your core beliefs may be more readily identified. To return to the metaphor of peeling the onion, your onion may not have too many layers. A few successful experiences in exposures may provide sufficient evidence to reveal and counter your core beliefs so that further exploration is unnecessary. If your anxiety and avoidance of feared situations are much improved and no longer interfere with your life, that is the best evidence that you have challenged the beliefs that are important for you. 193 Peeling Your Onion-Discovering and Challenging Your Core Beliefs 1.

The idea behind this approach is that if you understand the cause, the problem will go away. Scientific evidence does not suggest that this is true. Trying to understand the core beliefs that may underlie your ATs is not the same as trying to find an event that \"caused\" the sodal anxiety to develop. Also, identifying a core belief does not mean it will automatically change. As we demonstrated in the case examples, identifying the core belief means that you and your therapist know what fears you need to face through exposures. For example, Arlene\\'s core belief involved fear of what would happen if a secret from her past became known. This led her and her therapist to set up some exposure situations in which she discussed the past with appropriate people, including her family and her therapist. By using the tools you have-the cognitive skills and therapeutic exposure-you can challenge the core dysfunctional belief. Changing that belief is one of the final steps in fully overcoming your social .. anxiety. 198 1. By continuing to examine your ATs, you may be able to get at T F more core beliefs. 2. Attempting to examine other thoughts that occur along with an AT, T F focusing on the emotions experienced when thinking about ATs, and considering what might happen if an AT comes true are appropriate ways to attempt to get at deeper ATs, or core beliefs. 3. It is critical to understand the past events that led to your core beliefs T F in order to make changes and overcome your social anxiety, because understanding the cause makes the problem go away. 4. Common core beliefs among individuals who struggle with social T F anxiety often center around the belief that everything must be done perfectly and that there is something truly wrong with them. S. Attempting to understand the core beliefs underlying your ATs is T F similar to attempting to understand what events in your past led to your haVing social anxiety. Answers to Self-Assessment questions can be found in Appendix A. Getting Ready to Continue the Journey on Your Own: Consolidating Gains and Finishing Treatment Checklist of Progress So Far This chapter is most useful after you have spent several weeks working on managing your social anxiety in therapy. You and your therapist should review this checklist together to see how you are progressing. The chapter numbers in parentheses indicate where to go back and read more about a topic or skill. Are you: o able to identify ATs when you notice yourself becoming anxious? (Chapter 5) o able to identify the Thinking Errors in your ATs? (Chapter 6) o able to use Disputing Questions to challenge your ATs? (Chapter 6) o able to develop Rational Responses and use them to combat anxiety in situations in which you get anxious? (Chapter 6) o doing something every day to overcome your anxiety? (Chapter 8) o avoiding avoidance? Looking for opportunities to enter situations that make you anxious rather than avoiding them? (Chapter 8) o avoiding subtle avoidance and giving up the things that make a situation feel safer (e.g., only talking to people you already know at a party, avoiding certain conversation topics, over-preparing for speeches or meetings)? (Chapter 8) 199 This would also be a good time to go back and look at the situations you put on your Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy. Take out the second copy that you made in Chapter 4. This copy should not have any SUDS or Avoidance ratings on it. Without looking at your old ratings, re-rate Fear and Avoidance for each situation using the 0-100 scales we prOVided in Chapter 4 that are reprinted on the top of the form. After you have completed the ratings, take out your original Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy and compare the two sets of ratings. By now you should see some positive changes. Most people find that situations in the bottom half of the Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy change first. It is also common to see reductions in Avoidance Ratings before reductions in SUDS Ratings. As you have learned already, if you stop avoiding the things you fear, the fear will decrease as well. Also review the graphs for the weekly self-monitoring averages. Although your anxiety may have gone up for awhile as you stopped avoiding situations that make you anxious, the graphs should show your anxiety decreasing as you get to week 10 or 12 on the graph. If your new Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy ratings or the graphs of your selfmonitoring show you have made progress, it is time to celebrate. If you checked off some or all of the items on the checklist above, give yourself a pat on the back for all of your hard work. As you look at your progress, you might find yourself thinking, \"Yes, I\\'ve done those things, but social anxiety is still a big problem for me.\" That is a very destructive AT that will make you feel discouraged! Look carefully and you will see that this AT contains the Thinking Error Disqualifying the Positive. Using one of the Disputing Questions, ask yourself, \"Does still having some social anxiety mean that I have not made important progress already?\" Absolutely not. Just because you still have more work to do on your social anxiety does not mean that you do not get any credit for all of your hard work so far. In fact, by learning the cognitive self-help skills and how to face your fears productively, you have gained excellent tools that will help you make even more progress. How to Continue Making Progress Regardless of how much progress you have made in overcoming social anxiety, there are important habits you can develop to continue making progress: 1. Avoid avoidance. The sooner you stop avoiding the situations that make you anxious, the sooner you will overcome your social fears. Every time you avoid a situation that makes you anxious, you reward the anxiety and make it worse. Every time you avoid avoidance and enter a situation, even if it makes you anxious, you have an opportunity to conquer your fears. As you continue to progress, you should try to decrease your avoidance to zero. 200 2. Keep using the cognitive skills. As you become more familiar with the treatment procedures and they become routine, it will be easy to take short-cuts or stop using the cognitive restructuring skills. As will be discussed, the cognitive skills usually become fairly automatic with practice. However, it is extremely important to work through all of the steps, preferably writing them down on the BYOCC worksheet. These skills can be very powerful aids in controlling your anxiety. Systematic efforts to identify and challenge your ATs are essential to get as much as possible from each exposure. As we saw in the last chapter, identifying the dysfunctional core beliefs that underlie the anxiety requires repeated and systematic cognitive restructuring. 3. View an increase in anxiety as an opportunity. Over the years we have noticed that the individuals who make the most progress in this treatment program have a change of mindset at some point. Initially everyone tries to avoid their fears and protect themselves from embarrassment or negative evaluation. However, individuals who come to view an anxiety-provoking situation as an opportunity rather than a threat make the most rapid progress. These individuals view an increase in anxiety as a signal to charge forward into a situation rather than as a signal to stop, escape, or avoid. If you find yourself making suggestions to your therapist about how to make an exposure harder or more effective, then you have had this change in your mindset. 4. Reward yourself for your success. Facing one\\'s fears takes courage and motivation. Be sure to take every opportunity to give yourself credit for your success. Tell your therapist about each accomplishment. If you have family or friends who know you are working to overcome social anxiety, let them celebrate each success with you. Regularly take time out to think about all of the situations that are easier, all of the things you can do now that you could not do before you started treatment. Celebrate all of the ways your life has improved as you have conquered your fears. S. Use additional strategies to control your anxiety. The last chapter in this manual describes how medications can be useful for controlling anxiety. Medication is not intended to be used instead of what you have already learned but to supplement the treatment program. If you are not making as much progress as you would like, discuss with your therapist whether medication may be helpful for you. 201 New Situations Mean New Challenges In our research on cognitive-behavioral treatment for social anxiety disorder, we usually have clients come back 6 to 12 months after their treatment has ended so that we can see how they are doing. Every once in awhile someone will come back for one of these follow-up appointments feeling very discouraged because of a new situation that is causing anxiety and stress. For example, one man who had never held a regular job because of his social anxiety came in after several months at a new job as a maintenance man for a large apartment complex. He had been working as part-time assistant to an experienced maintenance person who was now leaving. The owners had asked the client to take over the full-time position. This would mean more faceto-face contact with the owners and supervision of a new part-time assistant. Despite his excitement about the promotion, he was very anxious about it and felt as if all of the gains he had made in overcoming his social anxiety were lost. The therapist quickly realized that nothing could be further from the truth. This man\\'s success in overcoming his fears had allowed him to be in situations that had never been possible before now. Because these were new situations, he was, understandably, experiencing some anxiety. The therapist helped him reframe the anxiety as a sign of his progress rather than as failure. He was then able to use everything he had learned in treatment to face these new challenges successfully. This example illustrates how the changes in your life that result from decreases in social anxiety may mean that you are in situations with which you have had little or no experience. There may be times that it feels like your social anxiety is getting worse when it is actually improving dramatically. The good news when you stop avoiding is that you have a lot more opportunities for things that are important to you. The bad news is that these new opportunities may also be somewhat stressful. You will not have to face the anxiety of a wedding day or a relationship break-up if you have never dated. You will not have to face the anxiety of the first day on the job you always wanted if you are too anxious to go to class and finish your degree. You will not have to face the stress of losing a job if you have never had one. As our clients have found themselves in this position, we have made two recommendations. First, go back and use the strategies that have worked so far. This is the time to pull out this manual again and refresh your memory of the cognitive self-help skills and therapeutic exposure. Second, if the anxiety seems too severe to face alone, go .back and work with your therapist for a few sessions. We\\'ll say more about returning to therapy for \"booster\" sessions later in this chapter. 202 Reactions of Family, Friends, and Other People As people go through therapy and start to make changes in their lives, it has an impact on others around them. Family, friends, and co-workers have all become accustomed to each of us being a particular person who acts in fairly predictable ways. As you start to overcome your social anxiety, you may find that other people are unsure how to react to you. They may be so uncomfortable that in subtle ways they encourage you to go back to being anxious. For example, if one person in a marriage is overcoming social anxiety about parties, the other person may feel rejected when he or she is no longer needed to carry all of the conversation at social gatherings. Co-workers might be surprised if someone who has always been shy and withdrawn gradually starts to make conversation and join them for lunch. They may initially forget to include the person in social plans because they still think of him or her as shy and withdrawn. Friends may be uncomfortable for awhile if a person switches from always being a listener to wanting to talk and to be more assertive when they are making plans together. Not surprisingly, these reactions can be frustrating for the person who is working so hard to overcome his or her fears. There may even be subtle pressure to return to one\\'s old socially anxious self. However, understanding these reactions can help you continue to push forward with the changes you are making. The good news is that once everyone is used to the new you, that quickly becomes the status quo. Then the same subtle pressure to keep the system in balance helps work to keep you more socially involved and less anxious. When everyone starts to expect you to go to parties, have conversations, make speeches, write/eat/drink in public, be assertive, or speak up in a group, then it is harder to go back to avoiding preViously feared situations. This new balance will help you maintain your progress. When to Stop Seeing Your Therapist Regularly Most people with social anxiety disorder will find that it takes 10-20 sessions with their therapist to get the most out of this program. That assumes that you and your therapist are concentrating on the social anxiety disorder in the sessions and not spending a lot of time on other problems you may be experiencing. To the extent you spend time in treatment on depression, marital difficulties, alcohol or drug problems, work or financial difficulties, or other issues, it will take longer to work through this treatment program. If the social anxiety disorder is severe, it may take longer. The following are signs that you may be ready to stop seeing your therapist regularly: 1. You have completed in-session exposures for the most difficult situations on your Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy and you have completed homework exposures for nearly all of the situations on your hierarchy. 203 2. You have met your most important treatment goal, such as going back to school, getting/changing a job, going on a few dates, or facing a specific difficult situation such as an important speech or social occasion. 3. Your social anxiety does not interfere in your day-to-day functioning in any important way. You may still have some anxiety but you feel able to handle it and rarely if ever avoid anything due to anxiety. As we discussed in the first chapter, social anxiety is a normal part of life. There will always be some situations in which you experience anxiety. This treatment does not make you immune to anxiety! In fact, for the rest of your life you may have more trouble with social anxiety than the average person who has not had this disorder. Our research shows that people who complete this treatment successfully still experience social anxiety fairly often. However, they continue to work on their anxiety on their own and when they return 6 or 12 months after treatment to meet with their therapist, they are doing better than at the end of treatment. Graduation Day There are two activities that we like to complete in the last session when someone graduates from this treatment program. You might find these helpful to do with your therapist. 1. Discuss with your therapist all of the changes that you have made over the course of treatment. As with all graduation days, this is the time to celebrate your accomplishments. Using Figure 13.1, \"My Accomplishments During Treatment for Sodal Anxiety,\" think about: the new skills you have learned the changes you have made in your life the ways in which you are more self-confident the things you have done that you either had never done before or had not done for a very long time Reviewing the changes in ratings on your Fear and Avoidance Hierarchy may help you think about some of your accomplishments as you complete this exercise. 2. Set a goal for yourself of a situation or fear you want to tackle by one month after treatment. Most people find that they \"backslide\" a bit the first couple of weeks after treatment is over. Without haVing to report back to a therapist about progress on homework, it is easy to stop pushing oneself to try new situations. Some avoidance behavior may return. By setting a goal for the first month after treatment, you will be much more able to get yourself back on track after taking the expected rest at the end of treatment. Record your goal 204 My Accomplishments During Treatment for Social Anxiety 1. New skills I have learned: 2. Changes I have made in my life: 3. Ways in which I am more self-confident: 4. Things I have done that I never did before or had not done for a long time: Figure 13.1. , \". . -. \\',,\\' Copyright  2000 by Graywind Publications Incorporated 205 Goal for the First Month After Treatment Ends By (date one month after treatment ends), I want to accomplish the following: Copyright C 2000 by Graywlnd Publlcations Incorporated on Figure 13.2, \"Goal for the First Month After Treatment Ends.\" Be sure to make a note on your calendar to remind yourself to accomplish the goal by the one-month date. When to Call Your Therapist for a Booster Session As you finish regular treatment sessions, most people experience some sadness over not seeing their therapist regularly. This is normal. However, most people also are pleased to be ending therapy because it signals that they are doing better. It is also nice to end the commitment of time, money, and emotional energy. As you have discovered by now, being in therapy is hard work! On the other hand, there may come a time in the next weeks or months that you find yourself struggling with social anxiety again. As noted above, this may be because you are facing new situations that your progress in treatment has made possible. Sometimes people become more anxious again if they have something stressful happen such as personal or family crises, death of a loved one, marriage, or a new baby. Even if the event is positive, it can be stressful. Occasionally people have a bad experience in a social or performance situation that they thought they had conquered, and their fears return temporarily. Whatever the reason, if you find your anxiety increasing or you are starting to avoid situations that make you anxious, take this manual out again and try using the 206 cognitive self-help skills more systematically. You may want to re-read the chapter on therapeutic exposure and try to systematically put yourself in some difficult situations in order to overcome the fears again. However, if you find that this is not working, it is time to call your therapist and request a booster session. Very often one or two sessions will help get someone back on track. In fact, it is usually true that if people come back to therapy just when they are starting to have trouble, it is easier than if they wait a long time. The longer you wait, the more likely you are to get into bad habits such as avoiding anxiety-provoking situations. More booster sessions will then be required. End of the Journey Together The remaining chapter in this book focuses on using medication to manage anxiety. If you have not already read this chapter, you may want to do so now. However, this is the end of the standard treatment program for overcoming social anxiety. You and your therapist may be finishing your work together (or at least shifting your attention to other matters). On the other hand, this is the beginning of your journey on your own, equipped with a toolbox full of skills and increased confidence to continue to take your life in a new direction. We wish you well. 1. Once you learn how to identify your dysfunctional core beliefs, you T F no longer need to practice the techniques you have learned in this treatment program. 2. You may make more rapid progress if you attempt to view a situation T F that makes you anxious as an opportunity rather than as something to avoid. 3. Entering totally new types of situations and becoming anxious means T F that your social anxiety is actually getting worse. 4. People in your environment, because they are not used to your new T F behaviors, may be uncomfortable and may subtly encourage you to go back to your old behaviors. S. If you have completed exposures for your most difficult situations, T F have met your most important treatment goals, and your social anxiety no longer interferes with your life on a daily basis, it may be time to consider stopping regular visits to your therapist. 6. \"Backsliding\" a bit after your treatment has ended means that the social T F anxiety is back and will probably get worse. Answers to Self-Assessment questions can be found in Appendix A. 207  Medication Treatment of Social Anxiety By Michael R. Liebowitz, M.D. How Medications Affect the Brain and Reduce Social Anxiety Although we may talk about feelings coming from our heart, in reality, they come from our brains. In fact, everything we say or do starts with tiny electrical and chemical reactions in our brains. We are born with brains well-prepared for important life-sustaining functions like breathing. Other things we learn along the way cause changes in our brains that will affect what we think, feel, say, and do in the future. Thus, if we want to change how we feel or act, as in reducing anxiety and avoidance, we need to change various processes in our brain. The first 13 chapters discussed how to make these changes with cognitive-behavioral techniques. This chapter describes the medications that may also be useful for making those changes. Several medications have been found useful in the treatment of social anxiety disorder. These medications can be grouped into broad classes based on how they work in the brain. The brain is made up of nerve cells that communicate with each other via chemical messengers called \"neurotransmitters.\" When one nerve cell sends a message to the next cell, it releases the neurotransmitter into the tiny space between the cells (called IIsynapses\"). The second cell accepts some of the neurotransmitter and passes the message along. The first cell soaks up any leftover neurotransmitter (this process is called IIreuptake\"). Medications can affect nerve cells by changing the amount of neurotransmitter that remains in the synapse or is available in the cell to be released when needed. Higher levels of a neurotransmitter in the synapse make it easier for messages to be passed from one nerve cell to another while lower levels generally makes this more difficult. What follows are discussions of each class of medications used to treat social anXiety disorder. Figure 14.1 summarizes information about several of the useful medications, gives their trade names and generic names, starting doses, maximum doses, and the minimum time you should take each medication before you can 209 Representative Medications for Social Anxiety Disorder Minimum nmeto Trade Generic Starting Maximum Test Class Name Name Dose Dose Usefulness Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors Paxiltl paroxetine 20rng 50mg 6-8 weeks Zolofttl sertraIine 50mg 200mg 8weeks Luvox4& fluvoxamine 50mg 300mg 8weeks Proza~ fluoxetine 20mg 80mg 8weeks Celexatl citalopram 20mg 50mg 8weeks Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors Nardil4P phenelzine 15mg 90mg 6-8 weeks Reversible Inhibitors of Monoamine Oxidase Aurorix4P moclobemide 100mg 900mg 8weeks Beta Blockers Inderal4& propranolol 1Q-20mg 40mg ** Benzodiazeplnes Klonopin tl c10nazepam O.5mg 4mg 4weeks \"\"Not applicable betause Inderalts typltany used on an \"as needed\" basis for social anxiety disorder. Figure \\'4~1; decide whether it will be helpful to you. Trade names are copyrighted brand names, and generic names are the names of the active chemicals in each medication. In this chapter, the trade names will be followed by the generic names in parentheses. More information about these medications, including potential side effects and the major difficulties with using them, are discussed in the remainder of the chapter. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRls) You have probably heard of medications like Prozacil\\'l (fluoxetine) and Paxillll (paroxetine). They have become very commonly used, with literally millions of prescriptions for these medications written each year. These drugs are from the class of medications referred to as \"Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitorsn or \"SSRIs.n Serotonin is the name of one type of neurotransmitter. The SSRIs prevent the body from removing serotonin from synapses (the spaces between nerve cells) by blocking the reuptake (\"soaking upn) of serotonin back into the nerve cells. When you take an SSRI, serotonin remains for a longer time in the synapses in 210 important areas of your brain, facilitating communication between your brain and nervous system. Several good scientific studies with Paxil<Al (paroxetine) and a smaller number with Zolo~ (sertraline) and Luvox<Al (fluvoxamine) suggest these SSRIs are useful in the treatment of social anxiety disorder. Socially anxious people taking these medications become more comfortable dealing with social situations. There is less anxiety and less avoidance. Preliminary studies with Prozac~ (fluoxetine) and Celexa~ (citalopram), two other SSRls, suggest that these drugs may also be helpful. The SSRIs are usually easy and safe to take. Their side effects may be uncomfortable for some people, but they are not generally regarded as dangerous. Side effects may include weight gain, interference with sleep and sexual function, and daytime drowsiness. When you take SSRIs, it is important to monitor other medications you are taking and watch for medication interactions. Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOls) While many people have heard of the SSRIs, people are typically less familiar with the next class of drugs that we will discuss, the /imonoamine oxidase inhibitors\" or /iMAOIs.\" These drugs work by inhibiting an enzyme in the body called monoamine oxidase (MAO). MAO is responsible for helping to remove excess levels of several neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. When MAO is inhibited, the removal process is blocked, and the levels of various neurotransmitters rise. Because the MAOIs cause increases in the available amounts of several neurotransmitters, they are among the most powerful medications available for social anxiety. MAOIs have been shown in several excellent studies to be quite helpful for patients with social anxiety disorder. The best-studied MAOI is called Nardil~ (phenelzine), and it has been on the market for about 30 years. Unfortunately, the MAOIs that are available in the United States, induding Nardil<Al (phenelzine), also inhibit some of the body\\'s protective mechanisms in the gastrointestinal system. Thus, if you take Nardil~ (phenelzine) or another standard MAOI, you have to avoid a substance called tyramine in foods and beverages. Tyramine is an amino acid (a building block your body uses to make proteins) and tends to be found in high amounts in any kind of aged protein, especially in aged (hard) cheeses or meats that have been allowed to age. You also have to avoid too much caffeine and alcohol, as well as cold medicines, especially certain decongestants, and certain medications such as demerol, dextromethorphan, and epinephrine that are often used in local anesthetics. You have to be very careful because if you eat foods or drink beverages that contain tyramine or take prohibited medications while you are taking an MAOI, you can have a dangerous rise in blood pressure that can even lead to a stroke. 211 Obviously, use of an MAOI for social anxiety should be under the supervision of a physician. The side effects of Nardi1<l\\'1 (phenelzine), in addition to potential high blood pressure reactions, may include weight gain, dizziness if you stand up too quickly, and interference with sleep and sexual function. These side effects can usually be managed with dosage adjustments or antidotes. However, MAOls are not easy to handle and many psychiatrists do not like to use them. If you are considering treatment with Nardi1 (phenelzine), make every effort to find a physician who has experience with both social anxiety disorder and the MAOls. Also, you must be given a list of prohibited foods, beverages, and medicines that you should carefully review with the physician before starting the drug. The two of you should also discuss the symptoms of a high blood pressure reaction and what to do if it occurs. Some physicians will give you an antidote to deal with the high blood pressure reaction to carry around with you. Many physicians also ask their patients to carry a wallet card or wear a bracelet identifying them as someone who is taking an MAOI, in case they are involved in a car accident or other medical emergency, so that medical personnel will know that they are taking an MAOI. The advantage of the MAOls is that they work well, work fairly quickly, and continue to provide benefits while you take them. The disadvantage is that some people will relapse when these drugs are stopped, even if they have taken them for as long as 9 months. Beta-adrenergic Blockers (Beta Blockers) Some persons with social anxiety disorder experience what might be called \"pure performance anxiety,\" characterized by difficulty in situations such as interviewing for a job, playing an instrument, giving a speech, and so forth. People with pure performance anxiety do not experience significant anxiety in other social situations. The class of medications referred to as \"beta-adrenergic blockers/\\' or \"beta blockers\" for short, is a mainstay for the treatment of this type of performance anxiety. These drugs block the effects of the hormone adrenaline on the body so that many of the symptoms of performance anxiety are reduced. For example, when individuals with severe performance anxiety get up to give a speech, their hearts may race, their voices quaver, their hands shake, and they may sweat. These are all symptoms of heightened arousal of the sympathetic nervous system, the part of your nervous system that prepares you for IIfight-or-flight.\" The person becomes aware of these distracting symptoms and may worry that the audience can see his or her nervousness. These concerns may further heighten anxiety, which increases physical symptoms, which may become more and more of a distraction, setting up a vicious cycle of increasing distress and decreasing ability to proceed (as was described earlier in Chapter 2). By blocking the effects of adrenaline on the body, the beta blockers dampen the development of this vicious cycle, 212 reducing heart rate and the intensity of other physical symptoms. So, even though you may still feel subjectively nervous, your body does not react as strongly in a nervous way. People take beta blockers for other medical conditions, such as high blood pressure or some heart problems, one to several times every day to make sure they are \"covered\" around the clock. If you suffer from pure performance anxiety, however, it may be better to use these drugs on an as-needed basis, taking your medication a half-hour to an hour before a speech or other performance. There are several types of beta blockers, and you should consult with your physician about which is best for you. However, beta blockers are not a cure-all, nor are they good for everyone with social anxiety disorder. They work best for people with pure performance fears. Although they may help you control your physical reactions, they will not help with anticipatory anxiety, the worry about how you are going to perform. People with severe performance anxiety often worry about a situation for weeks in advance and may lose sleep for several nights before the event. Beta blockers will not be helpful for this anxious anticipation, which will persist until you become convinced through experience or cognitive-behavioral therapy that you will be able to perform adequately. Benzodiazepines When people talk about taking tranquilizers, they are referring to the class of medications called /Ibenzodiazepines.\" Benzodiazepines reduce anxiety by their effects on a receptor system involVing a neurotransmitter called gamma aminobutyric acid (\"GABA\" for short). Unlike beta blockers, these medications can help with day-to-day social anxiety as well as the anxiety you may experience about a situation in which you have to perform, such as giving a speech or playing an instrument. Medications in this class include Xanaxll!l (alprazolam), Klonopin\\\\l!l (clonazepam), Valiumll!l (diazepam), and Ativan!f.\\\\ (lorazepam). The only side effect that you need to worry about when taking benzodiazepines on an as-needed basis for performance anxiety is feeling overly sedated or drowsy. The major downside of the benzodiazepines is the possibility that you may become addicted to them. If you take benzodiazepines on a daily basis for an extended period of time, your body becomes physically dependent on them, making it hard to stop taking them. If you do not take your medications for awhile, as might happen if you go away for a weekend and forget your pills, you will begin to experience unpleasant withdrawal symptoms, which are your body\\'s reaction to not having the medication. Some people may even have seizures if they withdraw improperly from benzodiazepines without consulting their physician. While there has not been much research on the issue among persons with social anxiety disorder, persons with panic disorder have often had serious problems stopping their benzodiazepine medications and may experience 213 a return of anxiety that can be quite extreme. However, if you and your physician gradually taper the dosage off over a period of weeks, withdrawal is generally tolerable. Klonopin~ (clonazepam) appears to be the best of the benzodiazepines in this regard. It is easier to stop and may result in less severe withdrawal reactions than Xanax~ (alprazolam), Va1ium~ (diazepam), or Ativan~ (lorazepam). Other Medications for Social Anxiety Disorder Other drugs such as BuSpar~ (buspirone), Tofranil~ (imipramine), and Selegiline (Ldeprenyl) have not been very helpful in initial studies, and further study may not be warranted. Anewer, safer type of MAOI, which appears to carry much less risk of high blood pressure reactions, has also recently been developed. One of these drugs is called Aurorix~ (moclobemide), and it is marketed in several European countries for depression and/or social anxiety disorder. However, recent studies in the United States and Europe did not find this drug to be very useful for social anxiety disorder. General Considerations in Undertaking Drug Therapy for Social Anxiety Disorder All of the medications described in this chapter are prescription drugs and should be taken only if prescribed for you by your family doctor or psychiatrist. Do not borrow these drugs from someone else or use them without proper medical super vision. Do not lend your medication to another person simply because you believe they suffer the same symptoms. You should follow your physician\\'s instructions about how to take the drug, and you should not experiment on your own with raising or lowering the dose. If a given dose is too weak or too strong, check with your physician about what you should do. Keep your physician informed about any bad reactions you experience. Your medical history and health should be checked before beginning medication trea\\'tment for social anxiety disorder, and you should be checked periodically during the treatment period. If you are taking an SSRI or MAOI, for example, blood tests should be conducted about every six months to be sure that the medication does not irritate your liver. Another potential limitation of medication as a treatment for your social anxiety disorder is the possibility that you may need to use it indefinitely in order to maintain your gains. That is, there is not yet any strong evidence that people can use medication for a while and then stop it without the anxiety returning. However, in one of our studies, about half the patients who took Nardil~ (phenelzine) for nine months and benefited from doing so were able to stop taking the medication and maintain their gains over the next 6 months. 214 If you have been on medication for a period of time and wish to discontinue the medication, you should gradually taper the dosage under medical supervision. Reduce your dose every several weeks by an amount agreed upon with your physician to see if there is any increase in symptoms. If there is, you might rethink whether it is the right time to get off medicine. On the other hand, if the decrease does not appear to result in any recurrence of symptoms, then it will encourage you to keep going and get off the medicine completely. Of course, the ultimate goal is to be able to live with manageable levels of anxiety, without medication if possible. Mixing Therapy and Medication Medicines and cognitive-behavioral therapy may work well together in several ways. Medications can make exposure to feared situations easier by reducing the severity of your anxiety symptoms. Medications may also help with changing your thinking as well. The SSRIs or MAOIs may help with any depression that you may be experiencing. Cognitive-behavioral therapy may increase the benefits that you get from your medication by pushing you to expose yourself to feared situations and see that the medication helps. Medication\\'s greatest strength in the treatment of social anxiety disorder may be the quick reduction of anxiety, while the greatest strength of cognitive-behavioral therapy may lie in the durability of improvements and the increased self-reliance that may follow. There are also some potential pitfalls of combining medication and cognitivebehavioral therapy for social anXiety disorder. There is some possibility that the two different kinds of treatment may work against each other in some circumstances. When you are receiving medication as well as cognitive-behavioral therapy, you may not be as willing or motivated to complete exposure exercises, possibly feeling that you do not have to work as hard because the medications will do the work for you. This assumption may undermine your progress. With cognitive- behavioral therapy, you build confidence in yourself, but over-reliance on medication may undermine this self-confidence. In addition, some medications, such as the benzodiazepines, may sedate you too much, interfering with your ability to complete exposure tasks or to benefit from them when you do. Clearly, the decision to use medications as part of the treatment for your social anxiety disorder is a very important one and should only be considered in discussion with your therapist or physician. If you take medication while receiving cognitive-behavioral therapy, it will most often be the case that the two treatments will be administered by different people. If so, you will get the best serviCe from both your physician and your cognitivebehavioral therapist if they work together as a team.   SESSION 1  1.\\tAgenda  After greeting the client (C), begin the session by describing the topics to be covered today. Let the client know that about one half of today\\'s session will be spent describing and explaining to him/her the therapy procedures, reviewing your understanding of his/her problem, giving him/her some information about yourself, and going over some of the business issues of therapy such as scheduling and cancellations. With the other half of today\\'s session we will begin the therapy procedures.  Encourage him/her to ask any questions that s/he may have and let him/her know that a lot of this information will be duplicated in printed form to be taken home.  2.\\tConfidentiality  Describe the procedures designed to maintain confidentiality in the project (the use of code numbers, locked file cabinets, etc.). Also explain the audio taping procedures (coded with C numbers) and the purposes for audiotaping sessions (supervision and research). Ask the client to sign an audiotape release form.  (After the client has signed the release form, turn the tape recorder on to tape the remainder of the session.)  3.\\tIntroduction  Introduce yourself and give your client some information regarding your background, experience and training as well as your role as a therapist in the project.  Inform the client that there will be 14 sessions (2 hrs. each) with a 2 week break before a 15th and 16th session, spread a week apart. Set up mutually convenient appointment times for future sessions. Provide the client with information regarding the procedures to follow for canceling a session and whom to contact in case of an emergency.  4.\\tRapport building  Ask client for his/her Daily Diary from the last 2 weeks and look over the entries, since these may be useful for the upcoming section. Explain to the client that you would like to review with him/her the information that you have gathered from the interview and from the questionnaire forms. Tell him/her that you feel it is important for the two of you to be starting at the same place, and with the same conceptualization and understanding of his/her problem. Encourage him/her to add information s/he believes to be important, and correct anything you may have misunderstood.  Then review for the client your understanding of his/her situation and complaints, its history, the course of the problem, the situations in which s/he has the most difficulty, what self-help efforts have been made, what progress has been made and how having this problem has impacted upon his/her life, work, emotions and relationships.  Take this time to organize, summarize and clarify for the client the information s/he has provided for you. The goal of this portion of the session is to further develop the relationship with the client and for him/her to feel understood.  Be sure to check with the client during this presentation for  his/her impressions of what you are saying and for any corrective information. Again encourage the client to ask questions and clarify the above information.  5.\\tDescription of treatment  Give a general introduction to the components of the treatment, its conceptual context, application and self-monitoring rationales, and your respective roles in the therapy process.   A.\\tProgressive and applied relaxation rationales  I would like to take the next few minutes to give you a general description of the treatment that we have designed to reduce your anxiety. Please feel free to stop me at any time to ask questions. We will be going over most of this information a number of times, so don\\'t worry if it seems like a lot right now.  The treatment that we have put together for you, and one that we believe is very effective in reducing anxiety, consists of the following: a) applied relaxation training which involves the identification of early cues of anxiety, learning the skills of Progressive Relaxation (PR) and other relaxation techniques and learning how to apply relaxation to anxiety cues (called applied relaxation, AR), and b) imaginal rehearsal via self-control coping desensitization, using AR and alternative, nonanxious coping thoughts, (c) cognitive therapy methods to help change how you are perceiving, interpreting, and believing, so that you\\'ll see less threat in the world and feel more confidence in your abilities to cope with the future.  The first component of the treatment, applied relaxation, involves identifying early cues of anxiety, and getting to know your anxiety in a different way. You will start to learn to catch the very early and beginning cues that occur when you are becoming anxious. To do this, I would like for you to start to monitor yourself, and how you feel, and to begin to become aware of even minor shifts in your anxiety (or, indeed any other negative emotional state) level. The reason for this is that often when we are anxious it can seem as though the anxiety has come on suddenly and unexpectedly, or we only notice it once it has gradually reached a high level. So, with more careful monitoring we usually find out that becoming anxious is actually a process. For example, you may find that at some point you were worrying about something, then your hands got clammy, or your throat got dry. Then you noticed your heart beating faster and started to worry about that, etc.. These early cues are what we would like you to get more and more familiar with.  In fact, anxiety involves a spiral of interactions among thoughts, images, feelings, behaviors, and bodily sensations. They tend to follow the same or similar course each time, because they are habits from the past. Each time the sequence occurs, it is stored back in our memory where the links in the sequence are strengthened, making them more habitual, more ready to be activated the next time an anxiety cue of any type is detected. For example, the more I worry about something, the stronger it gets, the more things remind me of it, and the more upset I\\'ll become the next time it is triggered. These facts will have several implications for learning effective coping techniques to reduce and eliminate anxiety: (a) It is not our reactions to things that are the problem; it is our reactions to our reactions that are the problem and the basis then of solutions.  (b) The earlier you catch the beginning of the anxiety spiral, the weaker it will be and so the more effective will be the coping response. (c) Each time a coping response occurs, it has three important effects. First the body and mind learn a new meaning for the anxiety cue; instead of it meaning growing anxiety and upsetness; it will mean,Time to use a coping response and shift perspective. Second, by cutting the spiral off early, the whole sequence doesn\\'t occur, so it is not strengthened in memory; in fact, it is weakened. Third, a new sequence is stored in memory and is strengthened (i.e., cue leads to immediate coping). Anxiety cues, instead of growing as they do, for example, with worry, are actually shrinking in number and strength. The coping responses become more practiced, stronger, and more habitual, so they get triggered more readily and frequently and with less effort. Another implication of these facts is that it is most effective to learn several types of coping response, some aimed at reducing affective and bodily reactions and some aimed at anxiety provoking thoughts and images. We will do this by having different types of relaxation skills established and different ways of substituting different types of thinking and believing. Finally, all of this implies that frequent application and practice is the ideal way to change things. This will be accomplished by showing numerous ways to apply the coping responses to daily living circumstance and by rehearsing and practicing these methods right here in the office using imagery and other techniques. I\\'ll have more to say about the imagery desensitization procedure later. Let me get back for the time being to the very crucial foundation for all of this: learning to self-monitor in order to detect early cues, thoughts, perceptions, and interpretations that trigger and contribute to the anxiety spiral.  There are a number of ways for you to start this monitoring. One way is to check with yourself on an hourly basis, to stop whatever you are doing and identify any feelings of tension, any sensations of anxiety, any distressing thoughts or images. (The therapist can give the client a copy of the PR Practice/Application handout now, with it turned to the application side, and tell the client that it is a written review of what they are now discussing.) Another way is to check out your body and mind for signs of anxiety every time you change tasks or enter a new situation. Why don\\'t we try this now. Take a minute to get in touch with how you are feeling. Then tell me on the scale that you have been using for the Daily Diary where your anxiety/tension level is right now and what that feels like.  (Ask the client now for the cues that s/he used to determine this level. It is important to go over this slowly and thoroughly. Feel free to get and use more than one example. Before moving on, be sure that the client has a good understanding of what is being asked of him/her regarding self-monitoring and identifying early cues.  Work out other cues that can be used in the client\\'s daily life to facilitate this monitoring, e.g., phone ring (delay answering), post-it reminders, behavioral anxiety spiral cues (foot tapping, rushing, hair twisting), out-the-door worrying initiation (Notice when you leave the office the first moment when worrying begins again.: habit demonstration), observe anger and other emotion cues too (worry elicits depression too)).   From this point on, pay close attention to your reactions to your reactions and how the anxiety spiral begins and develops for you. Monitor the situations (or reminders of situations) that trigger the beginning of anxiety, and observe the thoughts, images, bodily sensations, behaviors, and feelings that develop. Especially, try to catch those cues earlier and earlier.  (Show C that we can consider the self-monitoring as atreasure hunt in order to reframe focusing of attention on anxiety cues.  Let him/her know that at the beginning of each session, you will ask,What new, earlier cues did you discover this week?)  I will be asking you to continue to keep track of your anxiety level and the specific cues you catch on the Daily Diary that you have been using. This increased awareness will develop with practice and it is a very important part of this treatment.  Another important part this therapy is learning the skill of relaxation. I\\'ll actually show you a variety of relaxation methods from which you can choose. Later in today\\'s session I will describe some of these methods of relaxation in detail. One of these is a process of relaxation that involves tensing and releasing muscles groups and is called Progressive Relaxation. It has been shown to be very effective in reducing anxiety in a number of research studies. In addition to the muscular relaxation we will be asking you to practice, there is a relaxation response we callletting go. As in Progressive Relaxation, where we will be asking you to let go of physical tension, at times we will also be asking you to let go of other forms of anxiety, such as anxiety provoking thoughts and images. One of the goals of such letting go experiences is to help you to learn gradually to live only in the present moment rather than the illusion of the past (If only...) or the future (What if...) (elaborate on the notion of these illusions). This process of letting go is one that I would like you to experiment with, discovering for yourself how it works and how to apply it to anxious thoughts, feelings, and body sensations.  (Distinguish for C the notion that letting go implies initial accepting and allowing and not suppressing, and, later on, detachment and objective observation (fly paper analogy: Use solvent rather than trying to remove it with your other hand)).  The third component of the treatment is actually a combination of the first two. It is learning to apply your relaxation skill to those feelings of anxiety and tension and distressing worries, thoughts, images, and behaviors that you are monitoring. In other words, when you are checking in with yourself and identifying early cues of anxiety, I will also be asking you to respond to these cues by relaxing them away and letting them go. This component is called Applied Relaxation. Practicing Progressive Relaxation and other relaxation techniques will strengthen your skill in producing deep relaxation feelings, while practicing Applied Relaxation will lead to reducing your anxiety throughout the day, because you\\'ll be learning to respond to very early cues with a very effective coping response that keeps the anxiety spiral from developing (a different reaction to your reactions (cues)). With practice this can become an automatic process resulting in your leading a more relaxed lifestyle.  (At some point in describing,reactions to reactions, describe to C how instructive the behavior of small children is.  They react strongly emotionally to whatever is happening, and then immediately let go of that emotion once the environmental event is over or go on to the next moment (very rapid reaction, very rapid recovery).  They do not hold on to the past or overly anticipate the future.  They live more in the present, and their reactions to their reactions allow them to stay more connected to what is real, what is actually happening, rather than living in the illusion of the past or future.  Of course, it is adaptive for adults to have learned how to plan for the future and to retrieve important information from the past.  But we would usefully learn how to discriminate under what more limited circumstances we could adaptively do this.  Cognitive therapy will help teach such discriminations.)  B.\\tSCD Rationale and Description  In addition, we shall use a self-control desensitization procedure later in therapy. Briefly, this involves having you relax and then, while you are relaxed, having you imagine anxious situations and the physical reactions, worries, thoughts and images that come with your anxiety. As you are imagining these anxious events, you will begin to feel tense, and then we will teach you how to use your relaxation to let go of the anxiety and return to a relaxed state. Basically, we will be teaching you how to experience your worries and anxiety without fear and to reduce the frequency with which they occur. Self-control desensitization involves imagining, while you are extremely relaxed, each situation, thought, and physical sensation, as if it were actually occurring, and having you learn how to let go of these feelings by relaxing your mind and body. You will be given many opportunities to practice bringing on and then terminating anxiety right here in the office. At the same time I will teach you how to do this in your daily life. Later on, we will also develop together alternative thoughts as different reactions to your reactions and that can be used to cope with the anxious spiral, ones to substitute for anxiety-provoking thoughts both in SCD and in daily life when you catch an early cue.   \\tIt is clear that there are a variety of thoughts, images, behaviors, and physical reactions that occur when you are anxious. When these occur, they increase your feelings of tension. If, when they first occur, you could catch them and stop them, your tension level would be reduced. Therefore, a major thrust of our sessions will involve learning to identify quickly your earliest signs of tension and reduce or eliminate them through the use of relaxation. As I mentioned earlier, tension and relaxation are opposite responses which can\\'t occur together. Therefore, as you learn to relax in situations that previously made you feel tense, your overall level of anxiety will be reduced.  This skill is not difficult to learn, but it does require repeated practice. Therefore, we will practice using your relaxation to reduce your anxiety here in the office, and I shall also have you practice at home and at work. The practice will be of two types, twice-a-day formal practice of progressive relaxation and very frequent, brief applied relaxation techniques used throughout the day whenever you detect any beginnings of the anxiety spiral. You will notice that your relaxation response becomes stronger and stronger with practice, making it easier and easier to eliminate the anxiety before it builds. The earlier you catch any signs of tension or anxious thoughts, the weaker they are and the easier to eliminate. These techniques are useful in a variety of situations and can be used to reduce worrisome thoughts, unpleasant feelings of bodily tension and anxious images. They teach you new ways of coping with your anxiety, new ways to react to your reactions.  As I mentioned, starting today, I would like you to use the bottom portion of your Daily Diary form to note your worries, thoughts, images or physical symptoms that accompany them. This will give us situations to use for your desensitization practice, it will help us to identify cues that increase your anxiety. We will later work together to develop more adaptive thought processes as well.  C.\\tCognitive Therapy Rationale  The next major element to treatment has to do with cognitive processes. Anxiety is often caused by how we see things, ourselves and the world. When anxiety becomes too frequent or excessive, it is because we see too many things as threatening and we see ourselves as not capable of coping with these things. In fact, it turns out that there is less threat in our world and we have more coping abilities than we think. So treatment will focus on learning ways to change how we see ourselves and the world, how to perceive and interpret and predict and believe so that our mind is more accurate and realistic in seeing things the way they really are. This treatment will have several steps that you and I will carefully learn to apply to daily living: (a) monitoring and detecting how you do see and perceive and believe, the cognitive events that create your anxiety; these are best revealed by identifying what you are saying to yourself, your thoughts, and your images, (b) identifying those cognitive events that are inaccurate and anxiety provoking, even learning to classify the types of cognitive error that you might be making, (c) challenging these cognitions by examining their logic and evidence about their accuracy or inaccuracy, (d) developing more accurate views and beliefs to substitute for the inaccurate ones, (e) applying these new views to  your daily living, and (f) conducting your own experiments in daily life to give you evidence about the accuracy and usefulness of different ways of seeing things.  Let me say a few more things about how we will be conceptualizing the anxiety process. Anxiety is an emotion, an emotion that is experienced by every single individual. Anxiety is part of the experience of being human. Anxiety is not necessarily bad in and of itself but in some individuals it can occur either excessively frequently and/or at extreme levels of intensity so that it is distressing in that it can interfere with the individual\\'s level of functioning and importantly it is both the cause of and effect of worrying, one of the very central cognitive processes that we will be dealing with in therapy. In cases such as these, professional help is frequently necessary in order to help the person understand anxiety, reduce the frequency and/or level of anxiety and worry, and learn how to better deal with the stress, the anxiety itself, and the worrying, so that there is less likelihood of problems in the future.  Tell me again, how do you know when you\\'re worrying and when you are anxious? What are some of the things you feel, think, and do? (Allow time for response). When individuals with anxiety problems talk about anxiety, they usually mention a wide variety of physical feelings or symptoms as well as negative feelings and thoughts, and sometimes changes in behavior. The individual may report feeling tense, nervous, noticing rapid pulse, having difficulty breathing, frequent or excessive sweating, butterflies in the stomach, etc. Clients also report feelings of impending doom, thoughts that something terrible is about to happen, and a great deal of worrying and brooding about the present and particularly their future. Sometimes, clients also report changes in behavior associated with anxiety.   The therapist then should elaborate further on our model of anxiety. First, you can discuss the physiological aspect of anxiety: Once we perceive a threat, anxiety is a natural response and involves increased physiological arousal of the autonomic nervous system. The autonomic nervous system is that part of the nervous system that controls many of our bodily processes or bodily activities, particularly the functioning of the internal organs, such as the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems. When an individual perceives threat, some of the bodily processes are automatically increased. For example, blood flow to the extremities such as the hands, arms and legs, may be increased while blood flow to some of the internal organs will be decreased. The individual\\'s heart rate may become more rapid while digestion may be slowed down. All of this provides bodily resources to cope with real threats. Many of these physical changes also occur, however, during exercise, excitement, sexual arousal, etc. This arousal is associated with a variety of sensations, feelings, orsymptoms that are sometimes experienced by the individual as frightening or stressing in themselves. Also, when we decide we are anxious, we take these symptoms as evidence that there must be some threat present, even if we are not aware of exactly what it is that we are perceiving as threatening; indeed, often our anxious thoughts  and images happen so fast that we cannot identify them without practicing monitoring and detection. These sensations indeed can be quite unpleasant and distressing. However, they are just sensations and they are not dangerous. Anxiety involves an exaggeration of normal bodily processes. Everybody probably experiences at least some of the physical sensations or symptoms of anxiety at least occasionally. Some people actually go out of their way to experience these sensations (e.g., by riding roller coasters, watching suspense or horror movies, etc.). As stated before however, some individuals experience these sensations more frequently or at higher levels. However, again it is important to recognize that anxiety involves normal bodily reactions and they happen when we perceive threat. So it is the perception of threat that needs to be the focus of therapy. If threat is perceived but there is no actual threat or it is less than we perceive it, then bodily reactions are constantly being elicited withno place to go with them.  Let\\'s talk in more detail about the perception of threat and the role of cognitive processes involving our thoughts, beliefs, expectations, predictions in causing the perceptions of threat. People are influenced greatly by the type of things that they think about and the evaluations, interpretations, or appraisals of experiences. In short, our thoughts influence our moods, feelings, behaviors, etc. People frequently feel that our moods are determined by things that happen to us, our experiences, situations we experience, etc. For example, if a person says something to you that is insulting, that you feel is insulting, you might react by saying he made me feel angry.\\' In actuality however, people do not respond to situations that they experience; we really respond to our interpretations or evaluations of our experiences.   Let me give you an example of this. In a crowded theater a woman suddenly stands up, slaps the face of the man next to her, and hurries down the aisle to an exit door. Each person watching the event reacts in his or her own, idiosyncratic way. One woman is frightened, a teenager is angry, a middle-aged man becomes depressed, a social worker feels excitement. Why did the same event trigger very different emotions throughout the audience? The answer can be found by examining the thoughts of each observer.  The fearful woman thought,He\\'s going to go after her when they get home, and then she\\'s really going to get it. She imagined the details of a beating and recalled times when she had been physically abused. The angry teenager thought,He just wanted a kiss and she humiliated him. That poor guy, she must really be nasty. The middle-aged man who reacted with sadness thought,Now he\\'s lost her and he\\'ll never get her back. He could see his ex-wife\\'s face set in angry lines. The social worker felt pleasure as she thought,Serves him right. What a strong womanI wish some timid women I know had seen that.  In every case the observer\\'s emotion was a consequence of his or her thoughts. The event was interpreted, judged, and labeled in such a way that a particular emotional response was inevitable. You are constantly describing the world to yourself, giving each event or experience some label. You make interpretations of what you see and hear, you judge events as good or bad, painful or pleasurable, you predict whether they will bring danger or relative safety.  These labels and judgments are fashioned from the unending dialogue you have with yourself, and color all your experience with private meanings. The dialogue has been compared to a waterfall of thoughts cascading down the back of your mind. The thoughts are constant and rarely noticed, but they are powerful enough to create your most intense emotions. The internal dialogue has been calledself talk by Rational Emotive therapist Albert Ellis, andautomatic thoughts by cognitive theorist Aaron Beck. Beck prefers the term automatic thoughts because it more accurately describes the way thoughts are experienced. The person perceives these thoughts as though they are by reflexwithout any prior reflection or reasoning; and they impress him or her as plausible and valid.  Most people talk to others very differently from the way they talk to themselves. To others they usually describe events in their lives as a rational sequence of cause and effect. But they may at the same time talk to themselves with a horrifying or self-depreciating venom. One executive explained aloud,Shortly after losing my job, I found myself getting increasingly depressed. What nobody else heard were the worrisome thoughts that unemployment triggered:I\\'ll never be able to provide for my family again... Nobody would hire me... I\\'m a failure... Can\\'t make it. No matter how unrealistic these overgeneralizations may be, the executive believed them and felt them at the moment he said them to himself. So, as you can see, how we think will very much determine how we feel.  In similar fashion, people label their experiences as well as their reactions to situations almost constantly. Unfortunately, at times, individuals\\' interpretations of situations and experiences do not seem to be that accurate or at least not that useful. Our interpretations can get in the way and can cause considerable amount of problems. For example, if a person interprets a brief conversation with a member of the opposite sex as one in which he/she made a bad impression by saying or doing something wrong,\\' he/she is likely to feel anxious, perhaps foolish, etc. It really isn\\'t the social situation that resulted in the individual feeling anxious or embarrassed but rather the person\\'s interpretation of the situation. Our interpretations of situations can sometimes be identified or recognized by the type of things we say to ourselves in various situations. We are now talking about the thoughts that the individual has. We will be using the termself-statements to refer to thoughts or types of things people talk about. Just as cognitions or interpretations or self-statements can bring on negative mood and negative feelings, they can be turned around or modified to improve our ability to cope with stress and to deal more productively with various experiences and situations. Part of the procedures we will be focusing on during the treatment program will consist of procedures for learning different ways of dealing cognitively with stress and with anxiety by learning more useful, accurate self-statements to replace the anxiety-causing automatic thoughts.  There is an especially important kind of thinking that is particularly important in anxiety, that of worrying. Worry mainly involves the creation of lots of possible future catastrophes or ruminations about the past, and by so doing, creates most of our anxiety. Even though most of these catastrophes never happen, our body is reacting to these perceptions of threat anytime we worry. The events are not actually present; they are predictions of what might happen. Our bodies don\\'t know this, so the body reacts with alarm to these illusions. Therapy will aim at reducing worry by giving you ways to logically evaluate your worries and to make predictions about the future that won\\'t make you so anxious. You will also discover that you do have coping abilities to deal with almost anything that comes down the road, so your confidence will increase and you\\'ll become less inclined to worry about things. We also know now that each time we engage in worrying, it makes it stronger, and it almost never actually results in any solutions to the problems we worry about. So treatment will aim at stopping worry as soon as we notice it beginning, and will provide alternatives to substitute for it, alternatives that will also help you to actually discover solutions. Finally, all worrying as well as any excessive threat detection is founded on certain very specific beliefs about yourself and the world. Later in therapy we will apply similar methods to reorganizing your beliefs so they rest on a stronger, more accurate, and less anxiety-provoking basis. For example, ... (select one or two central distorted beliefs from the client\\'s pretherapy DAS and discuss their anxiety-provoking nature and likely distortion of what is true).   A third major component of anxiety besides bodily arousal and cognitive thoughts and images is the behavioral component. Anxiety may disrupt a person\\'s performance, particularly for behaviors that require concentration or skill, such as reading, doing a job that is difficult, or presenting a speech. Anxiety can influence behavior in another way. Some people learn to avoid situations or places in which they have experienced anxiety or where they think they might experience anxiety. We call this avoidance behavior. Or, some people may leave or run away from where they are when they start to experience anxiety. We call this escape behavior.  In general, people in this treatment program don\\'t have much problem with avoidance or escape. They tend to try to continue to go wherever they have to go, to try tostick it out when anxiety occurs, rather than avoiding or escaping. This is a good approach and we encourage you to continue going places as much as you can. If you do have any problems avoiding or escaping from places, please let me know and we may decide to work on these problems too. But again, realize that such avoidance is based on believing that there is actually a real and significant threat in those situations. We will examine whether or not that is actually the case, and we will often find that things aren\\'t as bad as they seem.  A more common problem among people in this program is that they may often adopt aspectator role in situations where they experience anxiety. This is, they become so occupied with their level of anxiety or their negative thoughts and worrisome thinking that they divert their attention away from the task at hand, and this in turn results in inefficiency. For example, an individual may become so preoccupied with the impression he/she is making in a social situation that he/she actually misses parts of the conversation. So the occurrence of worry and anxiety often  makes us miss what is actually happening, makes it less likely that we will learn and grow and respond adaptively to our present world, and causes us to miss the pleasures of life from moment to moment.  People with generalized anxiety often do report that their anxiety does interfere with their performance. The treatment strategies you\\'ll be learning are designed to reduce anxiety and to help you cope better when anxiety does occur. These strategies, therefore, are likely to decrease the extent to which anxiety interferes with or disrupts your behavior and performance.  So to briefly review, there are three major components of anxiety. First, the physiological arousal that is associated with different physical sensations or feelings. Second, the cognitive component, which involves our thoughts or self-statements, our worrying, our beliefs, interpretations and our expectations as well as visual imagery. Third, overt behavior, including avoidance and escape responses and quality of performance of skills and tasks. As I said before, it seems quite clear that these three components of anxiety are frequently related to one another. At times, cognitions may bring about increased physical arousal which is then interpreted as anxiety, which may then interfere with overt behavior. Alternatively, sometimes people respond to physical sensations by interpreting them as signs of anxiety, which increases the likelihood of feeling even more anxious. Remember the various physical sensations of anxiety are due to various changes in physiological arousal and are natural bodily changes that may be unpleasant but that are not dangerous. However, these can be seen as stimuli or events that can be interpreted by the individual. In many cases, the individual interprets or labels these physical sensations as being in some way extremely dangerous or terrifying or being evidence that something bad might actually happen. For example, an individual who is sensitized to the experience of anxiety may be aware of any changes in their bodily feelings. Any time that they identify some increased level of physical arousal, such as a more rapid heart rate, they interpret these changes as meaning that maybe there is a catastrophe coming, or that they are going to faint or lose control or embarrass themselves. This is an interpretation of physical changes. The interpretation is not necessarily correct and is very likely to increase anxiety. This increased anxiety may then result in even higher levels of physical arousal or physical sensations which then in turn may result in greater worries about the person\\'s health, sanity, likelihood of catastrophes, or ability to remain in control of him/herself. Thus, a vicious cycle has been established in which physical sensations increase the likelihood of further physical arousal, more negative thinking, and greater experience of the emotion of anxiety.  So, our treatment program consists of relaxation techniques for the somatic aspects of anxiety and cognitive techniques for the cognitive aspects, with desensitization to practice both of these coping methods. The cognitive techniques are especially aimed at changing your worrisome thoughts. These treatments have been shown to be effective for anxiety problems. After you learn and master these treatment procedures you will be much better able to understand anxiety, to deal with stress, and to reduce anxiety in a wide range of situations.   Let\\'s work a little on the cognitive aspect. The basic idea of cognitive therapy is to ask yourself how you are interpreting certain situations and to analyze some of the negative predictions that you are making. These kinds of self-statements almost always contribute to anxiety. Once you isolate these predictions you\\'ll learn to treat them as beliefs or hypotheses rather than facts. The general strategy is to begin to question and to challenge these hypotheses by examining the evidence for them and examining how you arrived at the conclusions. Frequent practice using the cognitive skills will be necessary in order to get maximum benefit from treatment. In our next session we\\'ll discuss how to monitor your thoughts and negative self-statements. In preparation for this, let\\'s take something that happened to you that made you anxious recently and see what we can discover about the thoughts and perceptions that caused the anxiety. (At this point, take one example and, using imagery reliving and recall, work with the client to specify the exact thoughts and images that made him/her anxious. Afterward, ask the client to note down on the CDD any detected cognitions for use in the next session.)  6\\tRespective roles in the therapy process  Through all of this it is important that we both understand our respective roles in this therapy process. My role is to assist you in developing skills that will help you cope more effectively with worry and anxiety. I will be here to work with you, provide you with information and support, and help to make this therapy as productive for you as I can.  However, most of this will be up to you. What I\\'ve just described for you is an effective way of reducing anxiety. It will be up to you to learn how best to use these techniques in your own life circumstances, and to practice, develop and apply these skill. I cannot overemphasize how important this will be.  At the end of this general description be sure to check with the client for any questions regarding the overall treatment plan. Then let the client know that you will now be moving on to construct a basic hierarchy for SCD.  7.\\tSCD Hierarchy Construction  (NOTE: The therapist should have prepared a list of potential hierarchy items from the ADIS interview and questionnaires to be used during this portion of today\\'s session.)  At this point I\\'d like us to work together to develop a graduated list of situations, worries, thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that contribute to your anxiety. I\\'d like us to make a fairly comprehensive list of these elements and then roughly rank order them from lowest to highest anxiety. The purpose in doing this is to allow us to begin work on low anxiety situations and sensations in coping desensitization, and as you develop more skills in learning to control and eliminate this anxiety, gradually to tackle harder situations. It is important in coping desensitization for you to gain some mastery over mild situations before we move on to more stressful events.  What we will do is to review each anxiety cue (thought, image, worry, feeling, bodily sensation) you experience when you are anxious and note each important one. We\\'ll write each one on an index card and have you order the cards in terms of which ones are the most distressing to you. They don\\'t need to be 100% accurate; we just need a rough gauge. I\\'ve already listed some from our earlier information. Please take a moment to add to these cards any cues of which I\\'m not yet aware and then rank order them. (Let client do this task now.)  Let me review all lists with you to be sure I understand how your anxiety feels and when it is most likely to occur and to add a few descriptive details which will be useful in coping desensitization. (At this point the therapist should get a) anticipatory, b) reactive and c) post anxiety detail. Also try to identify broad cues, such as fear of fear, that apply to this individual.)  As we do SCD, I will combine a variety of bodily cues, thoughts, feelings, images, and situations just to be sure you have ample opportunities to practice your relaxation coping response with your major anxiety cues.  As you self-monitor and detect other anxiety cues, write those down on your diary and imbed them into their appropriate place in the hierarchy.  8.\\tDiaphragmatic Breathing (DB)  Below is a copy of the Diaphragmatic Breathing handout that will be given to the client at the end of today\\'s session. In your own words present the client with the substantive points from this handout. Being sure to include the following:  1. A demonstration of the breathing technique [slowed (approximately 8-10 cpm, but the rate must be comfortable to C), paced, stomach breathing] 2 The client practicing DB 3. A discussion of what this is like for the C 4. A discussion of the application of DB 5. A suggestion to combine DB with the self-monitoring and early cue detection to begin immediately to reduce daily levels of anxiety, tension, and worry.  GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS SLOWLY AND THOROUGHLY \\t \\tDiaphragmatic Breathing  There are two ways of breathing. One way is to breathe from the chest; the other way is to breathe from the diaphragm. With chest breathing, the chest and ribs expand with each inhalation, while the abdomen remains relatively motionless. With diaphragm breathing, the stomach expands as the diaphragm moves downward to allow air to fill the lungs. Many people habitually use a combination of chest and diaphragm breathing.  We now know some very interesting facts about these types of breathing relevant to controlling certain crucial aspects of anxious experience. Rapid, shallow, chest breathing stimulates the sympathetic autonomic nervous system. It is this system which becomes aroused when the person becomes anxious. Its arousal produces many of the uncomfortable bodily sensations experienced during anxiety. Slower, deeper, diaphragm breathing, on the other hand, stimulates the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system. It is this system which becomes activated when a person becomes relaxed. Its arousal produces the comfortable bodily sensations experienced during deeply relaxed states. It is also the system that becomes activated after eating a large meal; it helps with the digestion of food. This is the reason why, after a large meal like Thanksgiving  dinner, we often feel very relaxed.  The implication is that, when we breathe with our chest, we will create anxiety-like sensations, and when we breathe with our diaphragm, we can create relaxation. Research has shown that people who are experiencing anxiety do indeed tend to breathe more rapidly and with their chest that their diaphragm. So, one important way to learn to control anxiety in daily life is to learn to habitually breathe form the diaphragm rather than from the chest, and to slow that breathing down to a comfortable pace. We need frequent reminders in the beginning to remember to do this, until it becomes a habit.  From now on, try to breathe more slowly and only from your diaphragm. Let it become a constant habit. Whenever you notice tension or anxiety, be sure to shift to slow, deep, diaphragm breathing and pay attention to the feelings in the abdomen as it expands and falls. Whenever else you check out your tension state during the day (e.g., on the hour; just before starting a new activity) be sure you are shifting to diaphragm breathing. At other times, when tasks are not demanding your attention (e.g., walking somewhere, taking a short break, waiting in a line, watching television) practice using slow, deep, diaphragm breathing. Use it also as a coping response whenever you detect any cognitive or somatic early cues.  You should notice, with extensive practice, that your body is learning to breathe from the diaphragm habitually. As this increases, you will have a significant effect on reducing daily tension and anxiety.  9.\\tHomework (HW)  Earlier in today\\'s session the therapist will have asked the client to begin self-monitoring, detecting the various early cues, applying DB, and continue working on the hierarchy. Take this time to review with the client these assignments and remind him/her to continue to fill out the Daily Diary (CDD), with special attention to noting identification of early cues of anxiety (both somatic and cognitive) as well as situational. Be sure client separately on the sheet keeps track of each and every worrisome concern that occurs during the day.  Let the client know that from now on, each session will begin with a review of last session\\'s HW, providing them with time to ask questions, problem solve, and clarify any questions.  10.\\tClosure  Take a few minutes at the end of the session to review with your client what has been covered in today\\'s session. This includes the rationale for the treatment, the logistics (number of sessions and times, appointment time for next session, etc.), and their reactions to what you have presented. Be sure to encourage questions and work with the client to develop a positive expectancy of improvement within the treatment condition.  11.\\tPaperwork  During the session the client should have been asked to sign the release for taping. At the end of the session, ask the client to complete the in-session and take-home forms below. Provide the client with an envelope to place these forms in after they have been completed, and tell the client that the only forms that you, as the therapist will be seeing are the CDDs, and the Reactions to Relaxation Scale (RRS) to be described and used in the next session. Let him/her know that this is to encourage him/her to be as honest and forthright as possible while filling in the forms and so that s/he does not need to be concerned with how you will feel about their answers.  Ask the client to take fresh CDDs home, and bring them back to the next session. You can tell the client that s/he will be receiving a new CDD every session, and to please bring the completed ones in to each session.  Then provide the client with the copies of the Therapy Explanation, DB Instructions, and CDD monitoring forms to take home with them.

Briefly outline the rest of today\\'s session for the C.  2.\\tReview of the Client\\'s week Re: Anxiety Symptoms, Daily Diary, HW, DB, continue refinement of hierarchy.  A) Take a few minutes in the beginning of this segment to briefly review for the client the therapy procedures, rationale and your respective roles. Provide the client with another opportunity to ask questions about this. Again take this time to continue to build with the client a positive expectancy for improvement.  B) Collect the Client Daily Diary since last session. Then review the client\\'s week according to the CDD, discuss his/her anxiety level self-monitoring, what early cognitive cues, automatic thoughts, and worries have been detected, DB and its frequency of application and successfulness, and any additions to the hierarchy.  Answer any question the client may have regarding last session\\'s HW, check with the client for any problems s/he may have had completing it, and help solve these problems.  C) Sometime in the beginning of this session, and each session from now on, be sure to ask the client to rate his/her present level of anxiety. As therapy progresses, this request should be repeated at least 3-5 times per session. At first the therapist can use behavioral cues as prompts for anxiety increases (i.e. tapping fingers, facial tension, etc.) and can share these cues with the client. Later on, shift this responsibility to the client, asking him/her to report to you any shifts in his/her anxiety level detected during the session. These shifts will most likely occur in the early portions of the session, while discussing the client\\'s week and anxiety symptoms.  When the therapist feels that it is appropriate, after asking the client to report his/her tension level, the therapist can also ask the client to take a moment and reduce this level via whatever rapid strategies have thus far been learned. Ask for anxiety level ratings both before and after this relaxation application.  Following this procedure in the therapy session will help provide the client with a model of what we are asking him/her to do in applied relaxation training during their daily living circumstances.  3.\\tCognitive Therapy: Cognitive Monitoring and Identification  Begin by discussing the nature of maladaptive cognitive processes. Beck and Emery (1979) view maladaptive cognitions as having two major characteristics: a) they are automatic; and b) they are very discrete predictions or interpretations of a given situation. The termautomatic means that these cognitions often occur very rapidly in certain situations, and may be outside of the person\\'s awareness. The termdiscrete refers to the fact that these cognitions are often very specific in content, and include very specific interpretations and predictions about the situation. The implication for treatment is that the client must first learn to become more clearly aware of the kinds of thoughts and self-statements and worrying that he or she is doing in certain situations, and that he/she must learn to pursue the thought  until he/she arrives at the very specific content or prediction which is creating anxiety. Other features characteristic of maladaptive cognitions are that they are: a shorthand message, almost always believed, spontaneous, awfulized, idiosyncratic, hard to turn off, learned, and often couched in terms ofshould,ought, ormust. Discuss each of these characteristics with the client. Show how aspects of these apply to worry. Give client the handout on characteristics of maladaptive thoughts (see end of Session 2).  The therapist should re-introduce cognitive monitoring with the following statement:Now let\\'s take a look at one situation in your life that is anxiety-provoking for you, like we did at the end of last session, and let\\'s try to look at the thoughts and interpretations and worries you\\'re having in that situation.  The therapist can use several methods to help the client identify automatic, maladaptive thoughts during this segment: imagery reliving of recent or predicted events, instant replay, slow-motion, establishing the significance of an event (what it means to the client), and client self-referent statements during therapy.  In addition to these procedures, a special method should be used to isolate the details of the client\\'s worry process. To do this, discuss with the client his/her worrying, its nature, and content. Then:   (a) choose one current worry, ask the client to close eyes and worry about it in their usual fashion. After a minute of worrying, ask client to describe in detail the flow of associations, images, and specific thoughts that occurred.  (b) Repeat the worry-minute, this time asking the client to talk aloud during the minute. Suchstreaming reports can help both of you become aware of the experience of worry for this particular client and begin to identify the specific negative thoughts and predictions contained in their worries.  (c) Ask client to pay attention to these specific contents each time they notice themselves worrying, and also to identify the earliest cues that triggered each\\t worry episode. They should from now on use the CDD to note specific automatic thoughts identified in the worry process.  During the session, the therapist can serve as a model and coach for this kind of self-monitoring and critical specifications of worry and other anxiety provoking thoughts. For example, a client may sayI am afraid of making a speech next week. In responding to a statement such as this, the therapist should ask questions which are designed to elicit specific interpretations and predictions which are being made by the client in the situation. For example, the therapist could askWhat do you think will happen? orWhat do you picture happening? orWhat are you telling yourself about the situation? In response to questions such as these, the client may produce more specific statements such asI am afraid that my voice will break and I will look like a fool. Statements such as these can provide the material that the therapist and client will work with during the interviews. They will also help to lead to the identification of underlying beliefs, especially if you ask questions like,And what would it mean to you if this should happen?    The general line of questioning for each anxious event followed by  the therapist should be: Uncovering the very specific predictions and interpretations which are being made by the client with questions such asWhat do you think will happen in this situation?What are you saying to yourself in this situation?What do you imagine will happen in this situation? If the client makes a very general statement, the therapist may be able to elicit more specific predictions and interpretations by simply askingthen what? Once the therapist has elicited a specific prediction or interpretation from the client, he/she then can proceed to show the client how to record the thought or self-statement on the monitoring sheet. In future sessions the therapist will use these data in the logical analysis of the client\\'s automatic thoughts. As you become familiar with thought monitoring over the next few weeks, you will be able to identify and eventually reevaluate your worrisome and anxiety-provoking thoughts. The first step in learning to deal your anxiety is to become aware of what cognitions are anxiety producing. To this end, monitor anxiety arousing cognitions and self-statements during the next week. Record the cognitions on the CDD. These cognitions will be used in future therapy sessions in order to develop cognitive strategies.  Worry Outcome Monitoring: Also have the client begin listing at the end of each day every worry that occurred, what they are afraid might happen (predicted feared outcome), and what outcome actually did occur eventually hours, days, or weeks later. The entries should include every bad outcome possibility that they thought of (separately for the environmental event itself and for their degree of coping with the outcome) and eventually what actual environmental and personal (coping) outcome occurred. Indicate that this will be our way of beginning to accumulate accurate evidence about the typical outcomes of worrisome concerns and the client\\'s abilities to cope with the future, a new history of probabilities and evidence based on actual observations.  This is also a way of encouraging focus on and processing of all environmental information.  Stimulus Control for Worry:  Also give C the stimulus control instruction sheet for them to take and to begin applying immediately.  Explain each step, its purpose, and how C can arrange to do it: (1) Set a 1/2-hr. worry period, same time and place each day.  (2) Monitor worry during the day and learn to identify its incipient occurrence as early as possible.  (3) Postpone to your worry period any noticed worries immediately upon detection.  Remind yourself that you have plenty of time to worry about these things later, when you can give them your undivided attention.  (4) Shift your attention to present moment sensation or the task at hand.  (5) Use your worry period.  The precise use will vary over sessions as you learn different ways of dealing with worry (e.g., at first, just worry intensely, later apply cognitive therapy and self-control desensitization techniques to them).  4.\\tPROGRESSIVE RELAXATION  A.\\tPR Rationale  Below is the rationale for the use of Progressive Relaxation (PR) for the treatment of general anxiety. It is adopted from the Bernstein and Borkovec (1973) manual. Verbatim presentation is not the goal. You should adapt the information into your own comfortable style, but be sure to include all substantive points. A printed copy of the rationale presented below will be given to the client at the end of today\\'s session.  PR Rationale Some of our time together will be devoted to training you in a procedure for reducing anxiety called progressive relaxation. These techniques were first developed in the 1930\\'s by a physiologist named Jacobson, and in recent years we have modified his original technique in order to make it simpler and more effective. Basically, progressive relaxation training consists of learning to tense sequentially and then relax various groups of muscles all through the body, while at the same time paying very close and careful attention to the feelings associated with both tension and relaxation. That is, in addition to teaching you how to relax, I will also be encouraging you to learn to recognize and pinpoint tension and relaxation as they appear in everyday situations as well as in our sessions here.  (Describe to the client (now or later, and periodically throughout therapy) the variety of beneficial effects of deep relaxation: Change from fight or flight preparatory response to perceived threat to tranquility, reduction of muscle tension, reduction of physiological activation, reduction of racing mind, increase in parasympathetic tone & attentional flexibility, breaking of anxiety spiral at the physiological/affective level, learning to identify incipient tension cues while in a more relaxed state where they can be better noticed, and ultimately learning tolet go of anxious somatic and cognitive activity.)  Please realize that learning relaxation skills is very much like  learning any other kind of skill such as swimming, or golfing, or riding a bicycle; thus in order for you to get better at relaxing you will have to practice doing it just as you would have to practice other skills. It is very important that you realize that progressive relaxation training involves learning on your part; there is nothing magical about the procedures. I will not be doing anything to you; I will merely be introducing you to the technique and directing your attention to various aspects of it, such as the presence of certain feelings in the muscles. Thus, without your active cooperation and regular practicing of the things you will learn today, the procedures are of little use.  Now I mentioned earlier that I will be asking you to tense and then relax various groups of muscles in your body. You may be wondering why, if we want to produce relaxation, we start off by producing tension. The reason is that, first of all, every one is always at some level of tension during his/her waking hours; if a person were not tense to some extent, he would simply fall down. The amount of tension actually present in everyday life differs from individual to individual. Each person has reached some adaptations levelthe amount of tension under which he operates day to day. The goal of progressive relaxation training is to help you learn to reduce muscle tension in your body far below your adaptation level at any time you wish to do so. Because of the way our bodies work, reducing muscle tension results in shutting off a variety of other physiological processes, i.e., it results in reducing your heart rate, breathing rate, and other bodily sensations that occur when we become anxious. Moreover, as our bodies calm down in this way, thoughts slow down and become clear and more rational. As we learn with practice to focus our attention on pleasant relaxation feelings, it becomes less likely that we will focus our attention on anxious thoughts (like,Oh no, I\\'m getting anxious orWhat if I have a panic attack/) or anxious images. In order to accomplish this, I could ask you to focus your attention, for example on the muscles in your right hand and lower arm and to then just let them relax. Now you might think you can let these muscles drop down below their adaptation level just byletting them go or whatever, and to a certain extent, you probably can. However, in progressive relaxation, we want you to learn to produce larger and very much more noticeable reductions in tension and the best way to do this is first to produce a good deal of tension in the muscle group (i.e. raise the tension well above adaptation level) and then, all at once, release that tension. The release creates amomentum which allows the muscles to drop well below adaptation level. The effect is like that which we could produce with a pendulum which is hanging motionless in a vertical position. If we want it to swing far to the right, we could push it quite hard in that direction. It would be much easier, however, to start by pulling the pendulum in the opposite direction and then letting it go. It will swing well past the vertical point and continue in the direction we want it to go.  Thus, tensing muscle groups prior to letting them relax is like giving ourselves arunning start toward deep relaxation through the momentum created by the tension release. Another important advantage to creating and releasing tension is that it will give  you a good chance to focus your attention upon and become clearly aware of what tension really feels like in each of the various groups of muscles we will be dealing with today. In addition, the tensing procedure will make a vivid contrast between tension and relaxation and will give you an excellent opportunity to compare the two directly and appreciate the difference in feeling associated with each of these states. Indeed, this muscle tension-release method of producing relaxation has been found superior to a variety of different methods of relaxation, and that is why we have chosen this particular technique for you.  There is a second important aspect to our work together. Although it often seems that we can be tense and anxious without any apparent cause, it turns out that there are many small signals in our life that trigger small anxiety responses and these can build our anxiety levels higher and higher. So learning to reduce anxiety involves not only developing a potent relaxation response to counteract the anxiety but also learning to identify the various triggers of anxiety earlier and earlier.  So in addition to learning an effective relaxation response to use to reduce anxiety, much of our time together will involve learning to identify these various signals, or triggers for anxiety, learning to detect their earliest occurrence during the day, and learning to quickly respond with relaxation whenever they occur. The earlier we can catch those signals and respond with relaxation rather than anxiety, the more calm and relaxed we\\'ll be throughout the day.  I will often refer to the notion ofletting go. In progressive relaxation, we produce relaxation in the muscle groups by first tensing the muscles and then releasing that tension. When we release the tension, we areletting go. That is, we stop doing whatever we were doing that was producing tension; we stop tensing our muscles. The notion ofletting go applies also to anything else that we might do to create anxiety. For example, attention to threatening objects or events in the environment can also be released, just as we let go of the muscle tension during progressive relaxation. Of course, this takes practice, since attention to anxious events is often automatic and habitual. If we practice letting go of these things and respond instead with a relaxation response, the habit of anxiety weakens and a more relaxed life-style becomes more habitual. (remind client of the notion of the illusion of the past and future; these exist only in our minds.)  So, you will basically be learning two things in your therapy sessions: how to quickly recognize anxiety triggers and how to let go of them using the relaxation response.  Please continue to use the bottom portion of your Daily Diary form to jot down worries and other anxiety-provoking thoughts and feelings as you notice them during the day. This will help us to identify those cues that contribute to your anxiety.  B.\\tRelationship of Rationale to Client\\'s Symptoms.  It is very important to relate the above abstract rationale to the specifics of the client\\'s anxiety experience. Describe to the client how applied PR specifically relates to and suits his/her symptoms, history and circumstances. This can be done after presenting the above rationale, or alternatively you can incorporate your observations of the client\\'s information directly into the rationale presentation. Emphasize the use of applied relaxation any time a worry begins, as a method of short-circuiting the worry sequence and preventing its strengthening in memory.  In future sessions when working on applied relaxation, use past-week anxiety or worry events as examples for discussing future AR to those types of situations and, later on, shift to anticipating and rehearsing upcoming events and worries in session.  Be sure to continue to check with client throughout the rationale to be sure that s/he understands the treatment, and answer any questions that s/he may have.  C.\\tDemonstration of 16 muscle group PR  (Again we will follow the Bernstein and Borkovec manual, with adaptations to suit your style.)  Muscle Tensing Strategies  Now the purpose of this first session is to help you learn to become deeply relaxed, perhaps more relaxed than you\\'ve ever been before, and we can begin this session by going over the muscle groups that we\\'re going to be dealing with in relaxation training. At this point in training, there are sixteen muscle groups to be dealt with, sixteen groups which are tensed and relaxed. As your skill develops, this number will be reduced significantly.  We will begin training with the hand and forearm ( the therapist should ascertain which arm and hand are dominant and begin on that side; for most clients this will be the right hand and right lower arm). I\\'ll ask you to tense the muscles in the right hand and right lower arm by making a tight fist. Now you should be able to feel tension in the hand, over the knuckles, and up into the lower arm. Can you feel that tension? O.K., fine. After we\\'ve relaxed that group of muscles we will then move to the muscles of the right biceps, and I\\'ll ask you to tense these muscles by pushing your elbow down against the arm of the chair. You should be able to get a feeling of tension in the biceps without involving the muscles in the lower arm and hand. O.K., can you feel tension there now?  (Several muscle groups may be tensed through alternative strategies and these are covered in the next section of this chapter.) All right, now after we\\'ve completed the relaxation of the right hand and lower arm and the right biceps, we\\'ll move over to the muscles of the left hand and left lower arm and tense and relax them in the same way as we did on the right side. We\\'ll also tense and relax the muscles of the left biceps just as we did the right biceps.  After we\\'ve relaxed the arms and hands, we\\'ll relax the muscles of the face, and for conceptual purposes we\\'re going to divide the facial muscles into 3 groups: first the muscles in the forehead area (the upper part of the face), then the muscles in the central part of the face (the upper part of the cheeks and the nose), and finally the lower part of the face (the jaws and the lower part of the cheeks). We\\'ll begin with the muscles in the upper part of the face, and I\\'ll ask you to tense these muscles by lifting the eyebrows just as high as you can and getting tension in the forehead and up into the scalp region. Can you feel that tension now? (At this point the therapist might want to make some statement about the fact that this part of the procedure involves a bit of face-making but that this is all part of the procedure; to further reassure the client the therapist himself should model the tension strategies and thus make faces along with the client.)  O.K., fine. Now we\\'ll move down to the muscles in the central part of the face and in order to tense these muscles I\\'ll ask you to squint your eyes very tightly and at the same time wrinkle up your  nose and get tension through the central part of the face. Can you feel the tension there in the upper part of the cheeks and through the eyes now? O.K., good. Next we\\'ll tense the muscles in the lower part of the face and to do this I\\'ll ask you to bite your teeth together and pull the corners of your mouth back. You should feel tension all through the lower part of the face and jaw. Can you feel the tension in this area now?  Fine. After we\\'ve completed the facial muscles we\\'ll move on to relax the muscles of the neck and in order to do this I\\'m going to ask you to pull your chin downward toward your chest and at the same time try to prevent it from actually touching the chest. That is, I want you to counterpose the muscles in the front part of the neck against those of the back part of the neck. You should feel just a little bit of shaking or trembling in these muscles as you tense them. Can you feel that now? O.K., fine. We\\'ll then move to the muscles of the chest, the shoulder and the upper back. We\\'re going to combine quite a few muscles here and I\\'ll ask you to tense these muscles by taking a deep breath, holding it, and at the same time pulling the shoulder blades together; that is, pull the shoulders back and try to make the shoulder blades touch. You should feel significant tension in the chest, the shoulders, and the upper back. Can you feel this tension now? O.K., fine.  Now, we\\'ll move on to the muscles of the abdomen and in order to tense the muscles in this region, I\\'m going to ask you to make your stomach hard; just tense it up as though you were going to hit yourself in the stomach. You should feel a good deal of tension and tightness in the stomach area now. Can you feel that tension? O.K., fine.  After relaxing the muscles in the stomach area, we\\'ll then move on to the muscles of the legs and feet, and we\\'ll begin with the right upper leg, the right thigh, and I\\'ll ask you to tense the muscles of the right upper leg by counterposing the one large muscle on top of the leg with the smaller ones underneath; you should be able to feel that large muscle on top get quite hard. Can you feel that now? O.K., good.  Then we\\'ll move on to the muscles of the right calf, the right lower leg, and I\\'ll ask you to tense the muscles here by pulling the toes upward toward your head. You should be able to feel tension all through the calf area. Can you feel that tension now? O.K., fine. Then we\\'ll move on and tense the muscles of the right foot, and in order to do this I\\'ll ask you to point the toe, turn the foot inward, and at the same time curl your toes. Now don\\'t tense these muscles very hard, just enough to feel the tightness under the arch and in the ball of the foot. Can you feel that tension now? O.K., good.  We\\'ll then move to the muscles of the left upper leg and tense and relax those muscles just as we did on the right side, then the muscles of the left lower leg, again using the same procedures as we used on the right side, and finally the left foot, tensing it and relaxing it just as we did on the other side.  Now do you have any specific questions about getting tension in any of the sixteen muscles groups that we\\'ve covered? (The therapist should at this point take time to assure that the client has been able to get tension in all the muscle groups covered and has  understood how to produce this tension. Some clients may ask if they have to remember all of the tensing strategies and you should assure them that you will be repeating the means of getting tension in each group as you go through the first training session itself.)  O.K., fine. Now there are some points I would like to make about this procedure before we begin. I\\'m going to be asking you to pay very careful attention to the feelings of relaxation that appear in the various muscle groups and since we\\'ll be starting with the right hand and the right lower arm I\\'m going to be using that as a reference point against which to compare the next muscle group. So, for example, when we\\'re working on the right biceps I\\'ll ask you a question likeDoes the right biceps feel as relaxed as the right hand and right lower arm? Thus as we go through this procedure I will be asking for comparative judgments on your part so that we can be assured that each muscle group gets as deeply relaxed as the one prior to it.  Another very important point to remember is that I will expect you to release the tension that you build up in these muscle groups immediately upon my cue. Please don\\'t let the tension dissipate gradually. For example, when you have been tensing the muscles in the right hand and right lower arm, I\\'ll ask you to relax, and when I do, I\\'d like you to completely and immediately release all the tension that\\'s present in the right hand and lower arm. Do not gradually open the hand; let all the tension go at the same time.  Once we have relaxed a group of muscles there is some advantage in not moving that group of muscles. Thus, I\\'ll ask you not to move in the chair unnecessarily; however, you may feel free to move in any way that helps you to continue to maintain a comfortable position at all times. Do not be afraid to move, but do not make any unnecessary movements during the session.   I\\'m also going to ask you not to talk to me during this session; we will communicate by means of hand signals on your part. Thus, for example, I might ask you to signal if there is complete relaxation in the right hand and lower arm by lifting the finger of your right hand (the hand signal should be made with the hand which is closest to the therapist). If the right hand and right lower arm felt completely relaxed you would then signal this to me just by lifting the finger; if you felt that these muscles were not completely relaxed, there would be nothing for you to do. Not signaling would indicate to me that there was some tension still remaining.  I expect this first session will take us about 40-45 minutes to complete, so you might like to visit the restroom before we begin.  (If this proves unnecessary, or after it has been accomplished, the therapist should ask the client to remove any constraints such as watches or tight rings. The client should also remove eye glasses and be sure to check for the presence of contact lenses; these should also be removed before relaxation training.)  Now many of these procedures will become much clearer to you as we go through them, but you have any further questions at this point? (The therapist should answer all pertinent questions at this point such that the client understands the procedures which are to come and is ready to begin training.) O.K., fine; now I\\'m going to ask you to recline in your chair to the fully reclined position and I  will dim the lights in the room so that we can effectively cut down external stimulation. We can now begin. Just close your eyes, keep them closed throughout the session, and get into a good comfortable position in the chair.  ALTERNATIVE TENSING STRATEGIES  Many clients have some difficulty in achieving tension through the procedures outlined in the preceding section. Therefore, for several of these muscle groups some alternative tension strategies are available.  For those clients who have difficulty in getting tension in the biceps by pressing the elbow down against the chair, the therapist should ask the client to press the elbow down and at the same time pull the elbow inward toward the body. This usually will produce tension in the upper arm while leaving the lower arm and hand in a state of relaxation; the therapist should avoid having the client tense the biceps by lifting the lower arm and hand off the chair, that is, by bending the elbow. But if all else fails, this procedure can be employed (the order of tensing the arm muscles should be reversed, i.e. the muscles of the biceps should be tensed and relaxed prior to dealing with the muscles of the lower arm and hand ).This should be used only in cases in which no other tensing strategy produces the desired results.  The muscles of the forehead can be tensed by asking the client to produce an exaggerated frown, that is, byknitting the brows. This technique usually suffices if the original strategy of raising the eyebrows fails.  Clients who have difficulty producing tension in the neck through the counterposition (tensing two opposing sets of muscles simultaneously) of the muscles in the front and back of the neck can often achieve satisfactory results by pressing the head back against the chair, that is by using their neck muscles to exert pressure against the chair. This is a less desirable means of tensing the neck muscles since it does not involve counterposition and one group of muscles or the other is likely to be left out of the procedure. However, it is a possible alternative.  An alternative means of tensing the muscles of the chest, shoulders, and upper back is for the client to imagine that two strings hanging from the ceiling and attached to his/her shoulders (like a puppet\\'s strings) are being pulled upward. This should produce an exaggerated shrug of the shoulders and the desired tension.  There are two alternative strategies for getting tension in the abdominal region. Instead of asking the client tomake the stomach hard, the therapist can ask the client either to pull the stomach in as far as it will go or push the stomach outward. Neither of these procedures is as effective as the standard strategy which actually produces counterposition of the muscles in the abdomen. One of these three techniques almost always succeeds.  For clients who find it difficult to produce tension in the thighs in the standard fashion, the therapist can suggest that the client lift the leg very slightly, thereby producing tension in the upper leg. Again this procedure is likely to involve only one set of muscles and is not recommended as the standard procedure.  An alternative tensing procedure for the calves involves asking the client to point the toes away from the head rather than to pull the  toes upward toward the head. This is a very good alternative strategy and will succeed with most clients who are unable to get tension with the standard procedure.  This list of alternatives is not exhaustive. The therapist may find that these alternatives may not succeed with a particular client\\'s problem or that a client may have difficulty in getting tension in a group which has no alternative strategy in this list. In either of these cases the therapist must devise a strategy which will produce the desired tension in the problem muscle group. At this point, the therapist\\'s concern should not be with adhering to standard procedures but rather with creating an alternative through which the client can get tension. The client and therapist should work together (as they must throughout relaxation training) to solve any problems which exist. Failure to find solutions to such problems could have important implications for the success of the training program since the production of adequate tension is a necessary condition for the building of skill in relaxation.  Another problem with which the therapist may be confronted is that the client may feel a certain muscle group has not been dealt with. (For example, a client may state that, while the muscles of the upper back feel well relaxed after application of standard techniques, the muscles of the lower back remain tense.) This does not happen often, but if such a situation occurs, the therapist must develop a tensing strategy which allows the client to achieve relaxation in these muscles. This can best be accomplished by asking the client to tense the muscle group in any way he/she wants. The client should describe how the tension is produced so that the therapist can give appropriate tensing instructions at later sessions.  Paste text from prior manual re combined muscles progressions   D)\\tProceed with 16 muscle group PR.  The format and details for actual PR are given in the Bernstein and Borkovec manual. A few minor changes required by the research project follow below and DB is added at the end of PR in this and all subsequent PR training periods.  Further comments on PR training for this research project:  1) In making use of relaxation patter, be sure to incorporate indirect suggestions that are particularly suited to the client\\'s somatic and cognitive symptoms.  2) Before client is reclined at the beginning of PR, ask client to use the (100 pt) anxiety level scale whenever you request an anxiety rating. After client is first reclined ask client to rate out loud how anxious or tense s/he is feeling right now.  Write client\\'s response on the Relaxation Observer Checklist (ROC) form. C\\'s code number, date, your name, and session number should be correctly filled in.  Ask for this rating again at the completion of the following points in the session: \\t-before forehead \\t-before chest \\t-before enjoyment period  3) At the completion of each of the 16 muscle groups, complete the top portion of the ROC for observable signs of tension/anxiety/discomfort.  4) Administer the Reactions to Relaxation Scale (RRS) immediately after arousing client from the relaxation experience. Be sure forms are properly labeled.  E)\\tDiscuss the PR experience and resolve problems.  (As with the rationale and the PR procedure, these instructions are taken from Bernstein and Borkovec\\'s manual, and should be adapted to suit the therapist\\'s own style):  At this point the therapist should ask a very important group of post-session questions. These should be asked in a somewhat structured fashion, and the therapist should give careful attention to the answers. The therapist should first ask an open-ended question likeHow do you feel? orWell, how was that? The client\\'s answer to this question should be an overall reaction to the procedure itself and may contain a variety of general statements. At this point the therapist should begin collecting more detailed information by asking specific questions about any problems that occurred during the session, for example,what was the trouble in getting the neck muscles relaxed?  In this way, the therapist can explore with the client any areas in which relaxation was not routine. If the entire procedure was relatively routine, the therapist can ask a more general questions such asI\\'d like you to think back over this session and tell me if you at any time had any problems getting the various muscles groups relaxed. The client is then likely to mention some problems or questions that he/she might have had that did not get communicated to the therapist during the session.   Whether problems are brought up by the client spontaneously or uncovered by the therapist in this questioning, it is important that some resolution of the problems is agreed upon. If an alternative tensing strategy is required, this should be determined ; if there is a point that the therapist did not communicate adequately to the client, this should be clarified. The point of delineating these concerns is to provide a list of problems to be eliminated so that the relaxation procedure can become routine and trouble-free.   During this problem resolution period, the therapist should at all times maintain an air of confidence. Problems should be dealt with in a very routine fashion. The therapist should indicate that these kinds of difficulties have occurred before and that there are corrective procedures available. S/he should then assure the client that the problems will in all probability disappear as the client practices the new procedures.  After any problems which arose during the session have been discussed and resolved, the therapist can ask the client to describe, in his/her own words, what relaxation feels like. This account is quite important because it helps the therapist to understand the kinds of sensations being experienced by this particular client and can aid the therapist in adapting thepatter to that client. For example, if in describing how relaxation feels, the client says that his/her limbs felt lighter or that s/he began to feel somewhat warmer or cooler, the therapist should note this information and included it in later sessions as part of the indirect suggestions. In the case of a client who experiences a warm feeling and a heaviness in the limbs, the therapist could in subsequent sessions say,Noticing the warm, heavy feelings of relaxation flowing into these muscles now as they become more relaxed. The therapist can thus avoid making  statements or indirect suggestions which are in fact not appropriate for a given client. Such information should be recorded carefully and referred to during subsequent sessions.  The therapist should also ask at this point if anything that was said during the initial session made it more difficult for the client to relax. If the client mentions any such statements, they should of course be eliminated from future sessions. A therapist should also ask if there were any statements made which facilitated the client\\'s relaxation, and these should be emphasized in subsequent sessions.  During the post-questioning, be sure to carefully (without suggesting the phenomenon) question the client regarding the possible occurrence of any, even mild, relaxation-induced anxiety in either somatic or cognitive domains. Begin such questioning by indicating that most people have, at times during relaxation, noticed unusual thoughts or images, and you should like to know (a) what unusual bodily feelings and (b) what unusual thoughts/images s/he had during PR. For each reply, ask whether that event was discomforting (tension-producing, anxiety-provoking). On the back of the ROC, take notes on the client\\'s experiences, and list each unusual event (somatic or cognitive; specify which).  If relaxation-induced anxiety does occur, let C know that that such events dissipate with practice and experience and with the learning of alternative relaxation methods (Heide & Borkovec, 1983).  5.\\tHomework Assignment  1) Twice a day PR practice 2) Continuing self-monitoring of anxiety levels 3) Detection of early cues, and use of DB to cope with them (i.e., frequent AR practice); Worry Outcome Monitoring and Stimulus Control applications 4) Continuing to refine the hierarchy 5) Study Client Handout: Characteristics of Maladaptive Automatic Thoughts 6) Daily Diary, entering automatic thoughts, worries, feared outcomes (external and internal), and actual outcomes  Spend a few minutes reviewing the HW assignment for the next session. Below is a copy of the Relaxation Practice/Application Homework handout. Ask the client to keep track of their frequency of PR practice on the bottom of the form and return it to you at the beginning of the next session. When assigning the PR practice, paraphrase the instructions below, being sure to emphasize the importance of twice-a-day practices in order to produce a well-learned skill and in order to establish two daily periods of deep relaxation whose effects will gradually generalize throughout the day.  _____________________________________________________________________  Client Handout:  Relaxation Practice/Application Form  You have been shown how to develop the skill of relaxation. Such a skill, if practiced, results in increasing ability to deeply relax and if applied properly, can result in reducing general daily tension and anxiety as well as periodic stress reactions to daily events. As daily homework between now and your next session, we ask you to do the following: 1)practice relaxation at least twice a day, and 2) practice identifying tension and anxiety cues during the day and attempt to relax them away using the procedures you are learning in the training sessions.  1) Pick two times during the day when you can spend 15 minutes alone for practice sessions. Be sure it\\'s in a quiet room with no  one to interrupt. Use a reclining chair or bed. Then relax yourself just as you did in the last session. That is, tense each of the muscles in the following muscle groups for about six seconds, release those muscles, and then concentrate only on the pleasant sensations of relaxation for about 20 seconds. Repeat if necessary and go on to the next muscle group once the previous group feels completely relaxed. Spend no more than 15 minutes per practice session.  Muscle groups:   1) right hand and forearm\\t 9) chest, back and shoulders 2) right biceps\\t\\t10) abdomen 3) left hand and forearm\\t11) right upper leg 4) left biceps\\t\\t\\t12) right calf 5) forehead\\t\\t\\t13) right foot 6) eyes and nose\\t\\t14) left upper leg 7) mouth, jaw and cheeks\\t15) left calf 8) neck\\t\\t\\t16) left foot   2) Using your relaxation skill effectively during the day to eliminate tension and anxiety will depend on your learning to catch the very early beginnings of body cues indicating that you are becoming anxious. The sooner you can catch a beginning cue, and the sooner you respond with relaxing that cue away, the less anxiety will develop during the day. Eventually you may well be able to relax away such cues automatically, without even thinking about it. It will just become a style of life for you. However, to learn this, it is essential that you practice identifying and relaxing away those cues frequently during the day. Remembering to do this is the hard part. To help remind yourself to practice this important relaxation application , you can use the following rules:  1) Once an hour, on the hour, stop whatever you are doing and attend to what your body and mind are doing. Identify any feelings of tension, any sensations of anxiety, and any distressing thoughts and briefly let go of those feelings or thoughts ... relax them away. Then continue with whatever you were doing.  2) Every time you change activities, do the same things: check out your body and mind and relax away any signs of anxiety. This can occur when you take a break from some task, when you change tasks, when you first move to a different location, etc. Just become aware of the frequent beginnings of new activities or events in your day and relax yourself when you first enter the new situation or activity.  3) Any time you notice feelings of tension and anxiety or the beginnings of a worry or other distressing thoughts, practice letting go of them and relaxing them away. Use diaphragm breathing and applied progressive relaxation.  Please realize that adopting a relaxed life style, as described above, will take time and practice. In the beginning you may notice no relief at all from following those procedures. But as your ability to relax and let go improves with relaxation training sessions and practice, and as your ability to identify even the smallest of anxiety cues increases as you follow the above procedures, your skill at eliminating tension, worry, and anxiety from your day will increase.  _____________________________________________________________________  6.\\tClosure  At the end of the session, check again with the client to see if there are any questions about therapy or any of the procedures so far. Then confirm the next appointment date and time.  7.\\tPaper work   Client In-Session Forms \\tRRS \\tTherapy evaluation form \\tWorking Alliance Inventory Client Forms to be taken home (and returned next session). \\tClient Daily Diary \\tRelaxation Practice/Application form (RPA) \\tClient Handout: Characteristics of Maladaptive Automatic Thoughts  Therapist in Session forms \\tObserver Rating Form   Client Handout: Characteristics of Maladaptive Thoughts  Automatic thoughts usually have the following characteristics:  a. They are specific, discrete messages. A young man who fears rejection tells himself,She doesn\\'t want you. You look silly. A woman who fears death simply says the wordhearse. A stock broker saysgone to himself to generate depression about a financial loss.  b. Automatic thoughts often appear in shorthand, composed of just a few essential words or a brief visual image. A woman who was afraid of heights had a half-second image of the floor tilting and felt herself sliding down toward the window. This momentary fantasy triggered acute anxiety whenever she ascended above three floors. The shorthand is often phrased in telegraphic style:lonely... getting sick... can\\'t stand it... cancer... no good. One word or a short phrase functions as a label for a group of painful memories, fears, or self reproaches. Sometimes the automatic thought is a brief reconstruction of some event in the past. A depressed woman kept seeing the stairway in Macy\\'s where her husband had first announced his plan to leave her. The image of the stairway was enough to unleash all the feelings associated with that loss. c. Automatic thoughts, no matter how irrational, are almost always believed. A man who reacted with rage to the death of his best friend was able to think for a time that the death was deliberately done to punish him. These thoughts have the same believable quality as direct sense impressions. The same truth value is attached to automatic thoughts as to your perceptions of the external world. If you see a man getting into a Porsche and have the thought,He\\'s rich, he doesn\\'t care for anyone but himself, the judgment is as real to you as your visual impression of the man climbing into the car. Automatic thoughts are plausible because they are hardly noticed, let alone questioned or challenged. They simply don\\'t get tested, nor are their implications and conclusions submitted to logical analysis.  d. Automatic thoughts are experienced as spontaneous. They just pop into the mindinsidious, sometimes undermining labels or judgments that seem true.  e. Automatic thoughts are often couched in terms ofshould,ought, ormust. A recent widow thought,You have to go it alone, you can\\'t burden your friends. Each time the thought popped into her mind she felt a wave of hopelessness. People torture themselves withshoulds such as,I should be happy... I should be more energetic, creative, responsible, loving, generous. Each ironcladshould precipitates a sense of guilt or loss of self-esteem.  f. Automatic thoughts tend toawfulize. These thoughts predict catastrophe, see danger in everything, and always expect the worst. A stomach ache is a symptom of cancer, the look of distraction in a lover\\'s face is the first sign of withdrawal. Awfulizers are the major source of anxiety.  g. Automatic thoughts are relative idiosyncratic. In the initial example, where a woman slapped her companion and left the theater, everyone had a different \\tresponse. Each response was based on a unique way of viewing the stimulus situation and resulted in a different strong emotion.   h. Automatic thoughts are hard to turn off. Because they are reflexive and plausible, automatic thoughts weave unnoticed through the fabric of your internal dialogue. They seem to come and go with a will of their own. They also tend to act as cues for each other. Everyone has had the experience of one depressing thought triggering a long chain of associated depressing thoughts.  i. Automatic thoughts are learned. Since childhood people have been telling you what to think. You have been conditioned by family, friends, and the media to interpret events a certain way.    \\t \\tSESSION 3  1.\\tAgenda for today  Briefly outline today\\'s session.  2.\\tReview of Week and Homework   A) Collect the Daily Diary and RPA forms from last session. Then review with the client his/her week according to the CDD, discuss the anxiety level self-monitoring, early cue detection, automatic thought and worry identifications, DB applications, and additions to the hierarchy from the CDD; Worry Outcome Monitoring and Stimulus Control applications.  B) Check on frequency of daily PR practice, conduciveness of environment and circumstances, degree of success experienced in depth of relaxation achieved on his/her own, use of the Worry Outcome Monitoring sheet, and use of the stimulus control methods for reducing worry. Review client\\'s study and understanding of characteristics of Maladaptive Automatic Thoughts.  Resolve any problems.  Encourage twice-a-day PR practice at conducive times and circumstances.  3.\\tCognitive Therapy: Challenging Automatic Thoughts and Beliefs  Once maladaptive automatic thoughts and worries are being clearly identified and specified, and the client is becoming proficient in early cognitive cue detection, the therapist can begin to introduce methods of challenging this way of thinking. Remind the client that each thought (prediction, interpretation, belief) is to be treated as a hypothesis, not as a fact, and that the next phase of therapy is to put those hypotheses to logical test. We will follow two main, general methods for teaching the client how to do this. First, the types of distorted thinking inherent in maladaptive thoughts and worries will be defined, exemplified, studied for homework, and applied to each maladaptive thought that the client identifies in self-monitoring. Second, logical analysis will be conducted, involving search for evidence and objective determination of probability. These are somewhat overlapping methods and are likely to be intermingled throughout therapy sessions, although Sessions 3 and 4 will likely concentrate on the former method and Sessions 5 and 6 will concentrate on the latter.  15 Styles of Distorted Thinking that can Cause Negative Emotion and Lead to Worry  What follows is a description of the variety of distorted thought styles that frequently cause anxiety and other negative emotions that lead to worry. Go over each one with the client, give examples, and work with the client to help him/her learn to identify examples of each error in their own CDD thought statements. Also give the client a handout that covers this material and ask him/her to study it before the next session. Your own homework as therapist before this session is to find examples of each error in the client\\'s previously turned-in CDDs.  a. Filtering  This distortion is characterized by a sort of tunnel vision, looking at only one element of a situation to the exclusion of everything else. A single detail is picked out and the whole event or situation is colored by this detail. A draftsman who was uncomfortable with criticism was praised for the quality of his  recent detail drawings and asked if he could get the next job out a little quicker. He went home depressed, having decided that his employer thought he was dawdling. He selected only one component of the conversation to respond to. He simply didn\\'t hear the praise in his fear of possible deficiency.  Each person has his/her own particular tunnel to look through. Some are hypersensitive to anything suggesting loss, and blind to any indication of gain. For others, the slightest possibility of danger sticks out like a barb in a scene that is otherwise warm with contentment. Depressed people select elements suggesting loss from their environment, those prone to anxiety select danger, and those who frequently feel angry select evidence of injustice.  The process of remembering can also be very selective. From your entire history and stock of experience, you may habitually remember only certain kinds of events. As a result, you may review your past and reexperience memories that characteristically leave you angry, anxious, worried, or depressed.  By the very process of filtering you magnify andawfulize your thoughts. When you pull negative things out of context, isolated from all the good experiences around you, you make them larger and more awful than they really are. The end result is that all your fears, losses, and irritations become exaggerated in importance because they fill your awareness to the exclusion of everything else. Key words for this kind of filtering areterrible...awful...disgusting...horrendous, and so on. A key phrase isI can\\'t stand it.  b. Polarized Thinking  The hallmark of this distortion is an insistence on dichotomous choices: You tend to perceive everything at the extremes, with very little room for a middle ground. People and things are good or bad, wonderful or horrible. This creates a black and white world, and because you miss all the nuances of gray, your reactions to events swing from one emotional extreme to another. The greatest danger in polarized thinking is its impact on how you judge yourself. If you aren\\'t perfect or brilliant, then you must be a failure or an imbecile. There is no room for mistakes or mediocrity. A charter bus driver told himself he was a real loser when he took the wrong freeway exit and had to drive several miles out of his way. One mistake and he was incompetent and worthless. A single parent with three children was determined to be strong andin charge. The moment she felt tired or slightly anxious, she began thinking of herself as weak, felt disgusted with herself, and criticized herself in conversations with friends.  c. Overgeneralization  In this distortion you make a broad, generalized conclusion based on a single incident or piece of evidence. One slipped stitch meansI\\'ll never learn how to sew. A rejection on the dance floor mea nsNobody would ever want to dance with me. If you got sick on a train once, never take a train again. If you got dizzy on a sixth floor balcony, never go out there again. If you felt anxious the last time your husband took a business trip, you\\'ll be a wreck every time he leaves town. One bad experience means that whenever you\\'re in a similar situation you will repeat the bad experience.  This distortion inevitably leads to a more and more restricted  life. Overgeneralizations are often couched in the form of absolute statements, as if there were some immutable law that governs and limits your chances for happiness. You are overgeneralizing when you absolutely conclude thatNobody loves me...I\\'ll never be able to trust anyone again...I will always be sad...I could never get a better job...No one would stay my friend if they really knew me. Your conclusion is based on one or two pieces of evidence and carefully ignores everything you know about yourself to the contrary. Cue words that indicate you may be overgeneralizing are all, every, none, never, always, everybody, and nobody.    d. Mind Reading When you mind read you make snap judgments about others:He\\'s just acting that way because he\\'s jealous...she\\'s with you for your money...he\\'s afraid to show he cares. There\\'s no evidence, but it just seems or feels right (feeling as fact). In most instances, mind readers make assumptions about how other people are feeling and what motivates them. For example, you may conclude,He visited her three times last week because he was (a) in love, (b) angry at his old girlfriend and knew she\\'d find out, (c) depressed and on the rebound, (d) afraid of being alone again. You can take your choice, but acting on any of these arbitrary conclusions may be disastrous without solid evidence.  As a mind reader, you also make assumptions about how people are reacting to things around them, particularly how they are reacting to you.This close he sees how unattractive I am...she thinks I\\'m really immature...they\\'re getting ready to fire me. These assumptions are usually untested. They are born of intuition, hunches, vague misgivings, or one or two past experiences, but they are nevertheless believed.  Mind reading depends on a process called projection. You imagine that people feel the same way you do and react to things the same way you do. Therefore, you don\\'t watch or listen closely enough to notice that they are actually often different. If you get angry when someone is late, you imagine everyone acts that way. If you feel excruciatingly sensitive to rejection, you expect most people to feel the same. If you are very judgmental about particular habits and traits, you assume others share your belief. Mind readers jump to conclusions that are true for them without checking whether they are true for the other person.  e. Catastrophizing  This one is especially relevant to worrying. If you catastrophize, a small leak in the sailboat means it will surely sink. A contractor who gets underbid concludes he\\'ll never get another job. A headache suggests that brain cancer is looming. Catastrophic thoughts often start with the wordswhat if. You read a newspaper article describing a tragedy or hear gossip about some disaster befalling an acquaintance. As a result you start wondering if it will happen to you.What if I break my leg skiing...What if they hijack my plane...What if I get sick and have to go on disability...What if my son starts taking drugs? The list is endless. There are no limits to a really fertile catastrophic imagination.  f. Personalization  Personalization is the tendency to relate everything around you to yourself. A somewhat depressed mother blames herself when she sees  any sadness in her children. A recently married man thinks that every time his wife talks about tiredness she means she is tired of him. A man whose wife complains about rising prices hears the complaints as attacks on his abilities as a breadwinner.  A major aspect of personalization is the habit of continually comparing yourself to other people:He plays piano so much better than I do...I\\'m not smart enough to go with this crowd...She knows herself a lot better than I do...He feels things so deeply while I\\'m dead inside...I\\'m the slowest person in the office...He\\'s dumb (and I\\'m smart)...I\\'m better looking...They listen to her but not to me. The opportunities for comparison never end. The underlying assumption is that your worth is questionable. You are therefore continually forced to test your value as a person by measuring yourself against others. If you come out better, you have a moment\\'s relief. If you come up short, you feel diminished.  The basic thinking error in personalization is that you interpret each experience, each conversation, each look as a clue to your worth and value.  g. Control Fallacies  There are two ways you can distort your sense of power and control. You can see yourself as helpless and externally controlled, or as omnipotent and responsible for everyone around you.  Feeling externally controlled keeps you stuck. You don\\'t believe you can really affect the basic shape of your life, let alone make any difference in the world. Everywhere you look you see evidence of human helplessness. Someone or something else is responsible for your pain, your loss, and your failure. They did it to you. You find it difficult to strive for solutions because they probably wouldn\\'t work anyway. An extreme example of this fallacy is the person who walks through skid row wearing three diamond rings and a $500 watch. He feels helpless and resentful when he gets mugged. He can\\'t imagine how he had anything to do with it. He was the passive victim. The truth of the matter is that we are constantly making decisions, and that every decision affects our lives. In some way, we are responsible for nearly everything that happens to us.  The opposite of the fallacy of external control is the fallacy of omnipotent control. If you experience this distortion, you feel responsible for everything and everybody. You carry the world on your shoulders. Everyone at work depends on you. Your friends depend on you. You are responsible for many people\\'s happiness and any neglect on your part may leave them lonely, rejected, lost, or frightened. You have to right all wrongs, fill every need, and balm each hurt. And if you don\\'t, you feel guilty. Omnipotence depends on three elements: a sensitivity to the needs of people around you, an exaggerated belief in your power to fill those needs, and the expectation that you, and not they, are responsible for filling those needs. This one is also very relevant to worrying, because worry often occurs when we feel that we wish we could change the past or that we need to control the future and almost everything that might happen in the future. But neither of these are possible.  h. Fallacy of Fairness  This distorted thinking style hinges on the application of legal and contractual rules to the vagaries of interpersonal relations. The trouble is that two people seldom agree on what fairness is,  and there is no court or final arbiter to help them. Fairness is a subjective assessment of how much of what one expected, needed, or hoped for has been provided by the other person. Fairness is so conveniently defined, so temptingly self-serving, that each person gets locked into his or her own point of view. The result is a sense of living in the trenches and a feeling of ever-growing resentment.  The fallacy of fairness is often expressed in conditional assumptions:If he loved me, he\\'d do the dishes...if he loved me, he\\'d help me to orgasm...if this was a real marriage, she\\'d hike with me and learn to like it...if he cared at all, he\\'d come home right after work...if they valued my work here, they\\'d get me a nicer desk.  It\\'s tempting to make assumptions about how things would change if people were only fair or really valued you. But the other person hardly ever sees it that way and you end up causing yourself a lot of pain.  i. Emotional Reasoning  At the root of this distortion is the belief that what you feel must be true. If you feel like a loser, then you must be a loser. If you feel guilty, then you must have done something wrong. If you feel ugly, then you must be ugly. If you feel angry, someone must have taken advantage of you. If you feel anxious or worried, there must be some real threat present.  Please realize that we often have images of our past or future failures, and these images immediately result in our bodies reacting just as strongly and in the same physiological way that they would if the failure event was actually happening right now when we imagine it.  Not only this, but all of this imaginal, affective and physiological information is then stored in memory as if the failure event has just now actually occurred.  This is why we later feel as if the event has occurred, again and again.  Indeed, research shows that if people imagine an event that never happened, much later when asked if that event had actually happened, they will report that it had!  This is also why, in SCD later on, we will practice imagining future events and their outcomes based on realistic appraisals of the most likely outcomes, outcomes that, as we\\'ll see, are very often if not always better than many of our catastrophic or negative predictions of what we fear might happen.  All the negative things you feel about yourself and others must be true because they feel true. The problem with emotional reasoning is that emotions by themselves have no validity. They are pro\\t ducts of what you think. If you have distorted thoughts and beliefs your emotions will reflect those distortions. Always believing your emotions is like believing everything you see in print.  j. Fallacy of Change   The only person you can really control or have much hope of changing is yourself. The fallacy of change, however, assumes that other people will change to suit you if you just pressure them enough. Your attention and energy are therefore focused on others because your hope for happiness lies in getting them to meet your needs. Strategies for changing others include blaming, demanding, withholding, and trading. The usual result is that the other person feels attacked or pushed around and doesn\\'t change at all.  The underlying assumption of this thinking style is that your happiness depends on the actions of others. In fact, your happiness depends on the many thousands of large and small decisions you make during your life.  k. Global Labeling  Your supermarket stocks rotten food at ripoff prices. A person who refused to give you a lift home is a total jerk. A quiet guy on a date is labeled a dull clam. Republicans are a bunch of money-hungry corporation toadies. Your boss is a gutless imbecile.  Each of these labels may contain a grain of truth. Yet it generalizes one or two qualities into a global judgment. The label ignores all contrary evidence, making your view of the world stereotyped and one-dimensional.  l. Blaming  There\\'s such relief in knowing who\\'s to blame. If you are suffering, someone must be responsible. You\\'re lonely, hurt, or frightened and someone provoked those feelings. A man got angry  because his wife suggested he build the fence he\\'d been meaning to put up. She ought to have known how tired he wasshe was being totally insensitive. The problem was that he expected her to be clairvoyant, to read his mind, when it was his responsibility to inform her of his fatigue and say no.  Blaming often involves making someone else responsible for choices and decisions that are actually your own responsibility. A woman blamed the butcher for selling hamburger that was always full of fat. But it was really her problem: she could have paid more for leaner meat, or gone to a different butcher. In blame systems, somebody is always doing it to you and you have no responsibility to assert your needs, say no, or go elsewhere for what you want.  Some people focus blame exclusively on themselves. They beat themselves up constantly for being incompetent, insensitive, stupid, too emotional, etc. They are always ready to be wrong. One woman felt she had spoiled her husband\\'s entire evening when she caused a fifteen minute delay in getting to a party. Later when the party broke up early she decided that she had bored everybody.  m. Shoulds  In this distortion, you operate from a list of inflexible rules about how you and other people should act. The rules are right and indisputable. Any deviation from your particular values or standards is bad. As a result, you are often in the position of judging and finding fault. People irritate you. They don\\'t act right and they don\\'t think right. They have unacceptable traits, habits, and opinions that make them hard to tolerate. They should know the rules and they should follow them. One woman felt that her husband should want to take her on Sunday drives. A man who loved his wife ought to take her to the country and then out to eat in a nice place. The fact that he didn\\'t want to go meant that heonly thought about himself.  Cue words indicating the presence of this distortion are should, ought, or must.  Not only are other people being judged, but you are also making yourself suffer with shoulds. You feel compelled to do something, or be a certain way, but never bother to ask objectively if it really makes sense. The famous psychiatrist Karen Horney called this thetyranny of shoulds.  Here is a list of some of the most common and unreasonable shoulds:  - I should be the epitome of generosity, consideration, dignity, courage, unselfishness. - I should be the perfect lover, friend, parent, teacher, student, spouse. Notice how often this one     may underlie your worries. - I should be able to endure any hardship with equanimity. - I should be able to find a quick solution to eve\\try problem. - I should never feel hurt, I should always be happy and serene. - I should know, understand, and foresee everything. - I should always be spontaneous and at the same time I should always control my feelings. - I should never feel certain emotions, such as anger or jealousy. - I should love my children equally. - I should never make mistakes. - My emotions should be constantonce I feel love I should always  feel love. - I should be totally self-reliant. - I should assert myself and at the same time I should never hurt anybody else. - I should never be tired or get sick. - I should always be at peak efficiency.  n. Being Right  In this distortion you are usually on the defensive. You must continually prove that your viewpoint is correct, your assumptions about the world accurate, and all your actions correct. You aren\\'t interested in the possible truth of a differing opinion, only in defending your own. Every decision you make is right, every task you perform is done competently. You never make mistakes.  Your opinions rarely change because you have difficulty hearing new information. If the facts don\\'t fit what you already believe you ignore them.  An auto mechanic got in the habit of stopping at the bar for three or four drinks on the way home. Frequently he got in after seven, and his wife never knew when to have dinner ready. When she confronted him he got angry and said that a man has a right to relax. She had it soft while he was pulling off cylinder heads all day. The mechanic had to be right and couldn\\'t comprehend his wife\\'s viewpoint.  Having to be right makes you very hard of hearing. It also makes you lonely because being right seems more important than an honest, caring relationship.  o. Heaven\\'s Reward Fallacy  In this framework for viewing the world you always do theright thing in hope of a reward. You sacrifice and slave, and all the while imagine that you are collecting brownie points that you can cash in some day.  A housewife cooked elaborate meals for her family and did endless baking and sewing. She drove her children to all their afterschool activities. The house was immaculate. She carried on for years, all the while waiting for some kind of special reward or appreciation. It never came. And she became increasingly hostile and bitter. The problem was that while she was doing theright thing she was physically and emotionally bankrupting herself. She had become a crab and no one wanted to be around her.  As you learn about these distortions you will notice that you have favorite ones. Others you will rarely if ever indulge in. Your high-frequency distortions are the ones you need to sensitize yourself to so that your coping resources will get called up whenever they come up. Begin monitoring your automatic thoughts from this point of view: What error did I just make with that thought?  Read and familiarize yourself with the chart summarizing these 15 styles of distorted thinking between now and our next session, and start labeling some of your CDD automatic thoughts in terms of what error occurred.  4.\\tContinue application training, discussion, questions and problem resolution.  Application training for this and subsequent sessions focuses on developing with the client methods and strategies for the increasingly rapid deployment of various relaxation strategies to  increasingly early cue detections. This is accomplished over the sessions by:  a) More detailed discussion of events during the previous week, isolating external and internal early cues that were not previously noticed or responded to with a coping strategy. Therapist should use imaginal reconstruction of such events, slow-motion replay, role-playing, etc. to facilitate such identifications.  b) Detailed discussion of upcoming days and anticipated stress events (mild as well as more severe), identification of likely, early cues, and agreement upon diverse coping methods that will be employed.  c) Training in the varieties of applied relaxation methods (cue-controlled relaxation, differential relaxation, imagery relaxation, diaphragmatic breathing,letting go metaphors) to be flexibly employed in anticipation of, response to, and recovery from the above identified cues, as well as for the development of a generalized, relaxed life style throughout the day.  Follow Bernstein and Borkovec\\'s manual for differential relaxation training, and include walks around the office and outside of the office to demonstrate, practice, and encourage generalization of its use to daily living.  d) Informal self-control desensitization. During all of the above, have the client practice deployment of coping strategies in imagery in response to the various cues identified in a) and b) above. With this technique in place, we now have three conditions in therapy under which the client is practicing the rehearsal of coping applications: formal SCD, informal SCD, and applications in-session when therapist or client notice incipient anxiety cues (#5 below). This variety of circumstances of rehearsal will facilitate the likelihood of coping response applications by the client whenever they notice cues in their daily life.  e. Special issues for GAD clients and relaxation training and application:  -Yerkes-Dodson: Relaxation will lead to greater efficiency, productivity, clearer thinking \\t- Fear of less productivity? :  ABAB experiments  - Nonjudgmental Attention and Processing of Present Moment Sensations and Information (i.e., Mindfulness). o\\t-Problem of trying to relax (achievement, perfectionism):  Movement toward tranquility o\\t-Past and future is always an illusion; anxiety is always one of these; It\\'s you creating this reality o\\t-Discovery: Watching for what cognitions, feelings, and behaviors will emerge from tranquility o\\t-Present-moment focus of attention o\\tSensation training: no reaction to reaction; no elaborations or judgments o\\tAttend and process present moment sensations and information; no reaction to it o\\tAsk for examples of present moment absorption: Fireworks, pleasant tasks, hobbies, soapy o\\tdishes  (and homework it: discover little present-moment joys)  5.\\tIn Session PR application.  As in Session Two, sometime in the beginning of this session, and each session from now on, be sure to ask the client to rate his/her present level of anxiety and to briefly relax away extant anxiety (and re-rate). This request should be repeated at least 3-5 times per session. At first the therapist can use behavioral cues as prompts for anxiety increases (i.e. tapping fingers, facial tension, etc.), and share these cues with the client. Later on, shift this responsibility to the client asking him/her to report to you any anxiety level shift detected during the session. These shifts will most likely occur in the early parts of the session, while discussing the client\\'s week and anxiety symptoms.   6.\\tImagery training  Below is a procedure designed to prepare clients for the imagery portion of SCD. Introduce it as such, practice it, and then add it on to the end of today\\'s PR exercise.  A. Identify a pleasant, relaxing image: Have client describe it in detail (colors, sights, sounds, smells, tactical sensations.)  B. Specify an item statement to cue this image.  C. Have client close eyes, and present image.  i.Turn the image on when I complete the statement of the image, keep it clearly in mind until I say, Stop visualizing that scene. Picture yourself as if you are actually in the situation.    ii. Ask if client was able to - turn image on immediately and vividly, - keep it vividly imagined during the entire time, - turn it off on command.  iii. Practice repeatedly until the above criteria are met.   \\tvi. Present image toward the end of the enjoyment period of relaxation training, and terminate by instructing the client toStop visualizing the scene and focus your attention on the relaxation sensations.  7.\\t4 Muscle Group PR Training and DB  Same as Session Two but with demonstration of the four major muscle group tensing strategies and with imagery practice added after enjoyment period.).  This procedure represents a condensation of the 16 muscle group procedures already employed. The groups are combined as follows:  (1) The first of the four groups consists of the muscles of the left and right arms, hands, and biceps. They are combined into one group and are tensed at the same time simply by asking the clients to combine whatever tensing strategies they had been using for each arm separately. This may mean that the clients are either liftin g both arms off the chair and bending them at the elbows or resting them on the chair and making a fist in both hands.  (2) The second group is made up of the muscles of the face and neck. In order to get tension throughout this area, the clients should be asked to tense all of the facial muscles while at the same time employing the tension procedure for the neck. This should produce adequate results, including the trembling which is characteristic of tension in the neck region.  (3) The third muscle group in this procedure includes the muscles of the chest, shoulders, back, and abdomen. There is no change from the seven group stage.  (4) The final group to be tensed in this procedure consists of the muscles of both the left and right upper leg, calf and foot, and again requires that the client simply combine the tension procedures he had been using in tensing each leg separately. This procedure usually can be mastered with little difficulty. However problems sometimes result from the use of inappropriate chairs. If there is any danger that tensing both legs at the same time will cause the client to lose balance and slip out of the chair, the therapist should remain at the previous seven-group level; that is, they should allow the client to continue tensing one leg at a time, thus creating a five group technique.  Once the client has learned to achieve deep relaxation using four muscle groups, the relaxation procedure should last 5-10 minutes. While this represents considerable savings in time for both the therapist and the client, the procedures outlined in this section are not designed simply to allow relaxation to occur more quickly. The therapist should not be intent on setting speed records. The major goal is development of the client\\'s ability to easily achieve deep relaxation at any time. The fact that this can occur rapidly is a secondary benefit. If the therapist has inadvertently placed an emphasis on speed, there may be difficulty in moving to the recall procedure since the clients will have too little time to focus closely enough upon feelings associated with  relaxation.  8.\\tRRS  9.\\tDiscussion of Experience, Resolution of Problems, Practice Reminder: Same as Session Two.  10.\\tHomework Assignment  1) Twice-a-day PR practice 2) Continuing self-monitoring of anxiety levels, automatic thoughts and worries information 3) Detection of early cues and frequent DB and AR applications; Worry Outcome Monitoring and Stimulus Control applications 4) Practice turning image on and off after PR practice 5) Client Daily Diary 6) Study Handout on Distorted Thinking Style Types  Spend a few minutes reviewing the HW assignment for the next session.  11.\\tClosure  At the end of the session, check again with the client to see if there are any questions about therapy.

You need to change people because your hopes for happiness seem to depend entirely on them. 13.\\tGlobal Labeling: You generalize one or two qualities into a negative global judgment. 14.\\tBeing Right: You are continually on trial to prove that your opinions and actions are correct. Being wrong is unthinkable and you will go to any length to demonstrate your rightness. 15.\\tHeaven\\'s Reward Fallacy: You expect all your sacrifice and self-denial to pay off, as if there were someone keeping score. You feel bitter when the reward doesn\\'t come.    \\t \\tSESSION 4  1.\\tAgenda for today  Briefly outline today\\'s session.  2.\\tReview of Week and Homework  A) Collect the Daily Diary and RPA forms from last session. Then review with the client his/her week according to the CDD, discuss the anxiety level self-monitoring, early cue detection, automatic thoughts and worry identification and outcome information, DB, and AR applications, additions to the hierarchy from the CDD, and imagery training practice; Worry Outcome Monitoring and Stimulus Control applications.  B) Check on frequency of daily PR practice, conduciveness of environment and circumstances, and degree of success experienced in depth of relaxation achieved on his/her own. Review client\\'s study and understanding of 15 Styles of Distorted Thinking.  Resolve any problems.  Encourage twice-a-day PR practice at conducive times and circumstances.  3.\\tCognitive Therapy: Continue discussion of 15 Styles of Distorted Thinking.  4.\\tContinue application training, discussion, questions and problem resolution.  Application training for this and subsequent sessions focuses on developing with the client methods and strategies for the increasingly rapid deployment of various relaxation strategies to increasingly early cue detections. This is accomplished over the sessions by:  a) More detailed discussion of events during the previous week, isolating external and internal early cues that were not previously noticed or responded to with a coping strategy. Therapist should use imaginal reconstruction of such events, slow-motion replay, role-playing, etc. to facilitate such identifications.  b) Detailed discussion of upcoming days and anticipated stress events (mild as well as more severe), identification of likely, early cues, and agreement upon diverse coping methods that will be employed   c) Training in the varieties of applied relaxation methods (cue-controlled relaxation, differential relaxation, imagery relaxation, diaphragmatic breathing,letting go metaphors) to be flexibly employed in anticipation of, response to, and recovery from the above identified cues, as well as for the development of a generalized, relaxed life style throughout the day.  Follow Bernstein and Borkovec\\'s manual for differential relaxation training, and include walks around the office and outside of the office to demonstrate, practice, and encourage generalization of its use to daily living.  d) Informal self-control desensitization. During all of the above, have the client practice deployment of coping strategies in response to the various cues identified in a) and b) above. With this technique in place, we now have three conditions in therapy under which the client is practicing the rehearsal of coping applications: formal SCD, informal SCD, and applications in-session when therapist or client notice incipient anxiety cues (#5 below). This variety of circumstances of rehearsal will facilitate the likelihood of coping response applications by the client whenever they notice cues in their daily life.  e. Special issues for GAD clients and relaxation training and application:  -Yerkes-Dodson: Relaxation will lead to greater efficiency, productivity, clearer thinking \\t- Fear of less productivity? :  ABAB experiments  - Nonjudgmental Attention and Processing of Present Moment Sensations and Information (i.e., Mindfulness). o\\t-Problem of trying to relax (achievement, perfectionism):  Movement toward tranquility o\\t-Past and future is always an illusion; anxiety is always one of these; It\\'s you creating this reality o\\t-Discovery: Watching for what cognitions, feelings, and behaviors will emerge from tranquility o\\t-Present-moment focus of attention o\\tSensation training: no reaction to reaction; no elaborations or judgments o\\tAttend and process present moment sensations and information; no reaction to it o\\tAsk for examples of present moment absorption: Fireworks, pleasant tasks, hobbies, soapy o\\tdishes  (and homework it: discover little present-moment joys)  5.\\tIn Session PR application.  As in Session Two, sometime in the beginning of this session, and  each session from now on, be sure to ask the client to rate his/her present level of anxiety and to briefly relax it away (and re-rate). This request should be repeated at least 3-5 times per session. At first the therapist can use behavioral cues as prompts for anxiety increases (i.e. tapping fingers, facial tension, etc.), and share these cues with the client. Later on, shift this responsibility to the client asking him/her to report to you any anxiety level shift detected during the session. These shifts will most likely occur in the early parts of the session, while discussing the client\\'s week and anxiety symptoms.   6.\\tIntroduce SCD and select today\\'s hierarchy scene.  A) Let your client know that starting in this session and each session from now on you will be adding the SCD procedure to the end of the relaxation procedure. Let him/her know that you will be selecting a scene for SCD together, beginning with those low on the hierarchy and slowly moving upward. Be sure to include worry sequences as the cues, frequently throughout SCD sessions. Also review the SCD rationale and procedure for him/her, being sure to include an outline of the 4 components: 1) turning on the scene from the hierarchy (and signaling when they notice any anxiety or a shift from their previously realized level of relaxation), 2) a coping response in which they stay in the scene but see themselves letting go of the anxiety and relaxing, (lowering their finger when they have achieved relaxation again), 3) amastery type of image where the see themselves remaining in the scene and remaining calm, and 4) turning the scene off and focusing only on the relaxation pr ocess.  Let the client know that this procedure will be repeated a number of times so that he/she can practice the relaxation/letting go response when they detect anxiety cues.  B) With the client select a scene from the lower end of the hierarchy, discuss this scene and prepare the client to use it in the SCD procedure.  7.\\t4 Muscle Group PR Training:  Same as Session 3.  8.\\tSCD  Self-Control Coping Desensitization Procedure  (NOTE: THE DESCRIPTION OF SCD BELOW INCLUDES ALTERNATIVE THOUGHTS GENERATED FROM THE SELF-STATEMENT THERAPY PORTION OF THE TREATMENT PACKAGE. STARTING IN THE NEXT SESSION AND EACH SESSION THEREAFTER THIS COMPONENT OF THE TREATMENT WILL BE INCLUDED AND YOU CAN FOLLOW THESE DIRECTIONS AS STATED. HOWEVER, FOR TODAY\\'S SESSION, LEAVE OUT THE ALTERNATIVE THOUGHT SUBSTITUTES.)  After client is completely relaxed, proceed directly with SCD procedure, employing those cues and alternative thought substitutions agreed upon during the first portion of the session.  Begin SCD as soon as you have completed relaxation training and DB (end of the summary of muscle groups and client has signaled complete relaxation.) I will now begin to present the images. Remember to visualize yourself as if you are actually in the situation as realistically as you can. Also, be sure to raise your index finger immediately when you first notice the beginnings of any tension, anxiety, or any shift away from the feelings of deep relaxation. Once you have signaled, continue to imagine the scene that I am describing and  hold your finger raised until you notice that the anxiety feelings have gone away.  Visualize yourself here in the Office, reclined in the chair, and you begin noticing (anxiety cue) beginning to occur... At the moment of client signal, or after 60 seconds of visualization without a signal, introduce the coping statements: Now just continue to visualize that scene as you being to imagine letting go of the (anxiety cue) saying to yourself (alternative thought substitute) .... Just visualize yourself letting go of (anxiety cue) completely ....; imagine relaxing it away as you become more and more relaxed .... imagining yourself here in the office and imagining the   (anxiety cue) lessening, becoming smaller (less intense, dissipating, melting away) .... Just visualize yourself letting go of (anxiety cue) and relaxing more and more deeply .... more and more completely..... saying to yourself (alternative thought substitute).... Continue such patter for another 20 seconds if there was no client signal, then terminate the image and use periodic relaxation patter for 20 seconds. If there was client signal, once client has dropped the signal, continue with the above patter (eliminating references to the anxiety cue) for another 20 seconds, at which time you can instruct client to stop visualizing that scene and continue focusing on the relaxation. Then provide another 20 seconds of periodic relaxation patter.    Repeat each image a minimum of 3 times, or, if anxiety was signaled, until client twice consecutively no longer signals anxiety within 60 seconds or until client is able to terminate the anxiety (i.e., drops signal within 7 seconds after client\\'s signal.)  Depending on client progress over sessions, introduce single or combined anxiety cues. In later sessions, add one (later two; ultimately all) cues into each scene, so that by session XII, client is able to imagine all cues typical of his/her anxiety experience, without reacting with anxiety and/or being able to rapidly terminate continuing anxiety reaction to the gestalt of typical cues.  The first presentation of each cue is done in the environmental context of the office. Thereafter for each additional representation of that cue, randomly enter a different environmental context from client\\'s list of critical situations. Not every cue will have a chance to be pared with every environmental context. The ideal is to avoid over-repetition of any one context; thus, use a relatively random inclusion of each context to insure that, by the end of therapy, each context has been presented approximately an equal number of times.  During desensitization, be sure to have a stop-watch or sweep-second hand on your watch in order to keep a continuous written record of the SCD events of the Desensitization Rating form. Be sure code information is filled in on the top of the form indicating client\\'s code number, session number, your name and date.

You can feel your heart beginning to race and pound ... More and more quickly and intensely ... You can feel the anxiety beginning to increase as you feel your heart pounding more and more.  Terminate the above patter as soon as the client signals anxiety by raising finger, and proceed immediately to Part II below. If client does not signal anxiety by the end of 60 seconds of the above patter, go to part II below.  II. COPING IMAGERY (CONTINUE PATTER BELOW UNTIL ANXIETY SIGNAL DROPS, OR, IF NO ANXIETY WAS SIGNALED, UNTIL 20 SECONDS HAS ELAPSED.) Just continue to imagine yourself in the therapy office with your heart pounding as you now imagine relaxing yourself and saying to yourself, ... (alternative thought substitute)... .. Just visualize yourself relaxing away the tension and anxiety... And as you do, imagine that the relaxation is reducing the speed of your heart and saying to yourself,...(alternative thought substitute) .. ... Calm and peaceful .. quiet and relaxed and saying to yourself,... (alternative thought substitute) ......Muscles becoming more and more deeply and more completely relaxed ... Heart racing just melting away, dissipating .. . Breathing becoming more and more smooth and regular .... Slow and deep ... As you imagine yourself reclined in the office and relaxing more and more and saying to yourself,...(Alternative thought substitute) ... ... Just letting go of the tension and anxiety ...  Continue the above patter until finger signal drops.. Then proceed to Part III.  If anxiety was not signaled originally, use above patter for 20 seconds. Then proceed to Part IV.  III. POST ANXIETY CUE IMAGERY PATTER (20 SEC. REGARDLESS) Just continue imagining yourself reclined in the office ... Relaxing more and more deeply and saying to yourself,... (alternative thought substitute) ... ... Muscles continuing to smooth out and unwind ... Loosening up and becoming more and more comfortably and deeply relaxed ... and saying to yourself, ... (alternative thought substitute) .... Nothing to do but to enjoy the pleasant sensations of relaxation as the relaxation process continues to take place as you imagine yourself here in the therapy office.  At the end of 20 seconds of the above patter, proceed to Part IV.  IV. POST-IMAGE RELAXATION PATTER (20 SEC. REGARDLESS) Stop visualizing that scene and go on relaxing .. Allowing the relaxation process to continue to take place now... Calm and quiet ... Peace and relaxed ... Simply enjoying the pleasant feelings of relaxation and noticing how very good it feels to be so deeply and completely relaxed.  V. REPEAT IMAGE, FOLLOWING THE ABOVE, OR PRESENT NEW IMAGE, FOLLOWING THE ABOVE  -3 60 sec. presentations of HIERARCHY IMAGE without any anxiety  signal, or  -until client twice consecutively no longer signals anxiety within 60 sec. of presentation of HIERARCHY IMAGE or until client is able to terminate anxiety within 7 seconds of signaling anxiety.  Example 2  Cognitive Cue, at work: I. PRESENTATION OF THE HIERARCHY IMAGE (60 SEC. OR UNTIL ANXIETY IS SIGNALED): Visualize yourself at work at your desk with the boss nearby... Imagine that your mind is thinking about what if you make a mistake; what if you should do something foolish ... You can feel the anxiety beginning to increase as your mind is thinking these things more and more .. Imagine the tension and anxiety rising as your mind continues to worry about acting foolishly.  Terminate the above patter as soon as the client signals anxiety by raising finger, and proceed immediately to Part II below. If client does not signal anxiety by the end of 60 seconds of the above patter, go to Part II below.  II. COPING IMAGERY (CONTINUE PATTER BELOW UNTIL ANXIETY SIGNAL DROPS, OR, IF NO ANXIETY WAS SIGNALED, UNTIL 20 SECONDS HAS ELAPSED.) Just continue to imagine yourself at work with your boss nearby as you now imagine relaxing yourself and saying to yourself,... (alternative thought substitute) ... ... Just visualize yourself relaxing away the tension and anxiety ... And as you do, imagine that the relaxation is reducing the thoughts in your mind ... Calm and peaceful and saying to yourself, ...(alternative thought substitute) ... ... Quiet and relaxed ... Muscles becoming more and more deeply and completely relaxed ... Negative thoughts just melting away, dissipating ... Breathing becoming more and more smooth and regular .... Slow and deep and saying to yourself,...(alternative thought substitute) ... ... As you imagine yourself at your desk at work, knowing the boss is nearby, and relaxing more and more ... Just letting go of the tension and anxiety and the negative thought.  Continue the above patter until finger signal drops. Then proceed to Part IV.  If anxiety was not signaled originally, use above patter for 20 seconds. Then proceed to Part IV.  In later sessions, when C succeeds in coping with an image by the above criteria for moving to the next image, provide 2 more presentations, but this time have C imagine the most realistic outcome actually occurring (with that realistic outcome being the product of cognitive therapy identifications).  This is to provide the processing of positive, realistic information and the strengthening of new beliefs at the affective (imaginal-efferent-command) level.  It also facilitatesfeeling-as-fact in the positive, realistic direction.  If particularly problematic images occur or if subsequent cognitive therapy runs into obstacles due to excessive anxiety surrounding a topic, consider using systematic desensitization to initially reduce the degree of anxiety before continuing with SCD or CT techniques on that issue.  Also in later sessions, use in SCDsurprise images and progressive anxiety-building scenes in order to making the progression of SCD imagery more like what our clients experience in daily living that results in their anxiety spirals.  9.\\tRRS  10.\\tDiscussion of Experience, Resolution of Problems, Practice Reminder.

B) Check on frequency of daily PR and SCD practice, conduciveness of environment and circumstances, degree of success experienced by the client in depth of relaxation achieved on his/her own. Review efforts to label logical errors in identified automatic thoughts.  Resolve any problems.  Encourage twice-a-day PR practice at conducive times and circumstances.  3.\\tCognitive Therapy: Logical Analysis Continued  Advantages and Disadvantages of a Thought, Perspective, or Belief  It is often useful to begin logical analysis of a cognition with a simple identification of its advantages and disadvantages.  Once these are established, proceed with actual logical analysis described below.  Faulty Logic: Explanation  As I have already explained, anxiety or worry in certain situations is usually caused by your interpretations or what you say to yourself in those situations. In the next sessions we will look at some techniques to change your negative self-statements by questioning and challenging your interpretations and assumptions. Using some of the entries in your self-monitoring sheets, I\\'ll show you how you can challenge some of your thoughts by asking you questions about how you arrived at the conclusion that created anxiety. As you learn these techniques you will be able to cope with worry and anxiety by asking yourself similar questions when you find yourself feeling anxious or worried outside of therapy.  The basic idea here is to ask yourself how you are interpreting certain situations and some of the negative predictions that you are making. These kinds of self-statements usually precipitate worry and anxiety. Once you isolate these predictions, you\\'ll learn to treat them as beliefs or hypotheses rather than as facts. The general strategy will be to begin to question and to challenge these hypotheses by examining the evidence for them and examining how you arrived at the conclusions.  Some general guidelines for the types of questions that the therapist can use during the analysis of faulty logic appear below. However, the general format for this questioning should be to remind the client that he/she is now treating his/her thoughts as hypotheses or guesses rather than facts, and that he/she should examine the evidence for his/her predictions. The therapist should not simply tell the client that he/she has made a particular type of error, but instead should ask the client to examine the contents of his/her statements, and then to try to decide whether or not he/she has made one of the particular logical errors. In the course of such questioning, the client may bring up other predictions or interpretations which can in turn be subjected to the analysis of faulty logic. The therapist may decide to pursue these additional predictions, or to make a note of them for discussion at future sessions, but the best strategy is to periodically return to the  original prediction or interpretation under discussion, and ask the client if he/she is now able to reevaluate in some way. With enough discussion, most clients will usually acknowledge at least a small change in their degree of belief and a certain prediction or interpretation.  The following section includes various types of client predictions and interpretations and possible therapist responses during the analysis of faulty logic. Simple declarative statements from the client can often be challenged by asking how the client knows that this is the case or where is the evidence that this is true.  Examples: 1) Client: My boss was grouchy today, he must not have liked the report that I turned in last week. Therapist:How do you know that his anger was directed at you? orDid he actually say anything to you to make you think that he was unhappy with your report? 2) Client: I really made a fool of myself at the staff meeting. Therapist:How do you know that? Client: I really felt anxious. Therapist:Well, you may have felt anxious, but what makes you say that you did badly, are you sure that anybody really noticed?  There may be times during the discussion when the client produces absolutistic overgeneralized statements such asI am a failure orI am a poor mother orI can\\'t handle anxiety. The therapist response to such statements can be the following:There may be times when you do okay? After some discussion, most clients will usually acknowledge at least a few instances in which their performance was adequate. The therapist can then ask:Then isn\\'t it a kind of overgeneralization to call yourself a failure (poor mother, incompetent worker, etc.)?  Very often questions and comments by the client regarding the therapy or the therapist may be a source of material for analysis of faulty logic. The general strategy here is for the therapist to ask what thoughts prompted the comment or question. Comments such asYou probably think I am a real basket case, orDo you think that this therapy will really work for me? can be responded to in the following manner:Well, let\\'s see if we can get at some of the thoughts that you are having about this. What are you saying to yourself right now? Such an inquiry will usually yield a number of overgeneralized catastrophic types of statements which can then be subjected to critical analysis.  Questioning evidence in support of a thought or belief leads naturally to searching for evidence against it. Some clients accept an idea as true simply because it occurred to them vividly, and a discussion of the difference between fact and a thought (no matter how vivid) may be useful. Therapists may need to repeatedly ask clients for evidence for or against ideas, in order to help the client adopt this process in everyday life. Clients may be able to distance themselves from an idea by imagining another person in the same circumstances, and thus interpret the circumstances as would an objective observer. Alternatively, therapists may role-play the client\\'s part and require the client to council him/her in his/her role-played part.   \\tTherapists should not assume that the client\\'s view is wrong, since it may well have a basis in fact, although it is likely to be an extreme and all-or-none version rather than a balanced position. They may also be over-generalizing from isolated examples, media stories, etc., or be making erroneous assumptions of causality, personal responsibility for events and so on. Therapists must be alert to these possibilities and question any conclusions expressed by the clients in the form of anxiety-arousing thoughts or beliefs. Even where there is a real risk of the outcome feared by a client, they may be guided towards thinking in probabilistic terms by estimating the probability that their idea is true or that the feared outcome will occur, in order to avoid all-or-none thinking.  Where erroneous conclusions are based on lack of knowledge (for example of common anxiety symptoms, the nature of insanity, heart disease, cancer, etc.) this should be provided, together with facts reducing the threat (for example, anxiety is not harmful, nor leads to disease, in any event help and/or treatment would be available, etc.). Therapists may also be able to suggest strategies for coping with anticipated difficulties (for example, disclosure, preparing emergency escape routes, etc.). These facts may then be incorporated into the client\\'s alternative viewpoint. Finally, clients can be asked for their worst possible fears and then to assume the unlikely event that they could come true (How likely?\\' and What if?\\'). When clearly articulated, even the client\\'s worst fears may seem more tolerable, or more time-limited, or more subject to amelioration than might have been assumed initially (It\\'s not the end of the world\\'). Another useful outcome is that the client has the opportunity of finding that simply thinking about the worst does not in itself lead to any bad consequences. More will be said later about the use of the more thorough decatastrophizing method.  It will become clear during early sessions that anxiety-related thoughts fit into one or more common themes, and the therapist will be watching for these from the beginning, especially as he/she is alerted to likely ones from the client\\'s pretherapy DAS. These themes indicate the existence of an underlying, irrational assumption of a more general kind. Common themes in generalized anxiety clients include lack of confidence, fear of fear, fear of the future and their ability to cope with it, social evaluative fears, critical self-judgment, and fears of loss of control. As with automatic thoughts, irrational beliefs should be specified and logical analysis performed on each. Examine the evidence for its validity and the pros and cons of believing in this way.  In working with the client to logically analyze a thought or belief, make use of the variety of possible questions that can contribute to its success, and teach the client to use these questions on his/her own.

B.- What does this situation mean to me?    - What evidence do I base this thought on? - What am I basing this evidence on? - Am I confusing a thought or feeling with a fact? - What are the advantages of my having this type of thought? - What disadvantages are there? - What do I suggest I do about this belief? - What would be the worst thing that could happen? - What is the worst thing you can imagine happening? - How could I test that thought out? - What am I afraid will happen if I try this? - What else would happen? - What percentage of the people do I think would think I was losing control, foolish, stupid, etc.? - Are these people important to me? - Has there been any time in the past when I entered a situation even though I was afraid of feeling              \\tanxious? - How did that turn out? - How do I feel when I say should, must, have to, as compared to want or like to? _____________________________________________________________________  It will be useful in the process of learning to challenge cognitions (and to later generate alternatives) that the client be instructed in how to adopt a scientific attitude towards thoughts and beliefs. So at some point, introduce this notion to the client. Scientific attitudes is a strategy for anticipating and circumventing a client\\'s resistant behaviors. The mai\\tn point of this technique is that clients should be taught to value the kind of objectivity that characterizes scientific inquiry and to regard their own rules of evidence in that light.  Method  a. Present a series of scientific attitudes, such as those presented on the followingAttitude Checklist, to your clients. Discuss why each is necessary, and how it is useful in discovering the causes and cures of problems.  b. Obtain your client\\'s concurrence in using this scientific point of view.  c. When your clients show a contrary attitude during the analytical process, refer to the checklist and ask if they have changed their minds about rules that they had previously approved. Continue the analysis only after you and your clients agree again to the scientific attitudes.  Example. Attitude Check List  a. As best you can, deal with facts as they occur, instead of relying upon opinion. Example: Fearing elevators is a fact; believing that elevators cause fear is an opinion.  b. Accept facts which have been substantiated even if they directly contradict our feelings. (We must then work on changing our feelings, instead of twisting the facts to fit them.) Be intellectually honest. Let the facts contradict the theory no matter how personally distasteful. Example: Accepting that your present frustration may be based on  being overindulged when young, even though you don\\'t like thinking of yourself asspoiled. Example: Accepting you have a drinking problem even though you hate the idea of being an alcoholic.  c. Refrain from dogmatic conclusions based on insufficient evidence. Don\\'t consider uncontrolled case examples as evidence. Example: Don\\'t jump to such conclusions as,My marriage conflicts cause my anxiety. My friend got over her anxiety when she got divorced.  d. Recognize the difference between hypotheses and facts. Example:Anger turned inward produces depression is a hypothesis, not a fact.  e. Remain without an answer until one can be found. Don\\'t just make one up because there is a gap in your understanding. Say that you don\\'t know. Example:I don\\'t know why I lose my temper all the time, but I think it is sexual frustration.  f. Accept no theory a priori or permanently. Example:The cause of people\\'s psychological problems is failure to sufficiently integrate various intrapsychic systems. This hypothesis is subject to change on the basis of actual evidence.  g. Reject no theory a priori. Example:It can\\'t be my thoughts causing problems because I don\\'t remember thinking anything. This theory too is subject to change on the basis of evidence.  h. Search as hard for counter evidence to your theory as you search for evidence for it. Actively attack and challenge your own theories as hard as you challenge contradictory views. Example: Find evidence to support the idea that emotions can cause attitudes, as well as the view that attitudes can cause emotions.  i. Examine testable theories. Abandon those theories that cannot conceivably be verified (purely metaphysical) or reframe them into testable propositions. Avoid explanations which are pure invention. Example: It may not be possible to test such hypotheses asAncient inherited archetypes cause my present emotional responses, or productive to test,Stress is caused by an asymmetrical alignment of energy forces in the body.  Comment  Scientific attitudes guide clients through logical analysis. The therapist must be careful not to batter clients by inferring they are ignorant or worthless for not believing them.  4.\\tContinue application training, discussion, questions and problem resolution.  Application training for this and subsequent sessions focuses on developing with the client methods and strategies for the increasingly rapid deployment of various relaxation strategies to increasingly early cue detections. This is accomplished over the sessions by:  a) More detailed discussion of events during the previous week, isolating external and internal early cues that were not previously noticed or responded to with a coping strategy. Therapist should use imaginal reconstruction of such events, slow-motion replay, role-playing, etc. to facilitate such identifications.  b) Detailed discussion of upcoming days and anticipated stress  events (mild as well as more severe), identification of likely, early cues, and agreement upon diverse coping methods that will be employed   c) Training in the varieties of applied relaxation methods (cue-controlled relaxation, differential relaxation, imagery relaxation, diaphragmatic breathing,letting go metaphors) to be flexibly employed in anticipation of, response to, and recovery from the above identified cues, as well as for the development of a generalized, relaxed life style throughout the day.  Follow Bernstein and Borkovec\\'s manual for differential relaxation training, and include walks around the office and outside of the office to demonstrate, practice, and encourage generalization of its use to daily living.  d) Informal self-control desensitization. During all of the above, have the client practice deployment of coping strategies in response to the various cues identified in a) and b) above. With this technique in place, we now have three conditions in therapy under which the client is practicing the rehearsal of coping applications: formal SCD, informal SCD, and applications in-session when therapist or client notice incipient anxiety cues (#5 below). This variety of circumstances of rehearsal will facilitate the likelihood of coping response applications by the client whenever they notice cues in their daily life.  5.\\tIn Session AR application.  As in Session Two, sometime in the beginning of this session, and each session from now on, be sure to ask the client to rate their present level of anxiety and to briefly relax it away (and re-rate). This request should be repeated at least 3 times per session. At first the therapist can use behavioral cues as prompts for anxiety increases (i.e. tapping fingers, facial tension, etc.), and share these cues with the client. Later on, shift this responsibility to the client asking for reports of any anxiety level shift he/she detects during the session. These shifts will most likely occur in the early parts of the session, while discussing the client\\'s week and anxiety symptoms.  6.\\tSelf-Statement Training and SCD scene identification.  Identify scenes from the hierarchy to be used in this session, and flexible alternative coping thoughts for use, to the degree that the latter have been identified during prior cognitive therapy segments.  As soon as possible, homework tasks are agreed for the client to carry out between sessions, related to approaching (even creating) anxiety arousing situations and applying their developing coping responses. These are arranged contingent on successful SCD or related hierarchy items and should be assigned in a graduated fashion over sessions and responsive to degree of success experienced.  7.\\t4 Muscle Group PR Training: Same as previous session.  8.\\tSCD  Following procedures outlined in session 4 and incorporating alternative coping self-statements generated in the cognitive therapy segments of prior sessions.  9.\\tRRS  10.\\tDiscussion of Experience, Resolution of Problems, Practice Reminder:  Same as Session 2, with the following additions: a) Inquire about SCD with self-statement substitution and its effectiveness.  b) Encourage deployment of such self-statements upon early cue detection, and encourage client coming up with his/her own new self-statements for two other identified anxiety-provoking thoughts.  11.  From this session on, begin to construct exposure opportunities for C to approach.  Use SCD hierarchy information to identify first mild and later more anxiety-spiral provoking situations for C to begin engineering or confronting, in order to provide extinction as well as rehearsal of coping responses opportunities.  Emphasize in all AR applications, including these homework exposures, the application of relaxation (and indeed all newly learned coping responses) to the periods before (anticipation), during, and after (recovery) the event.  Also emphasize the usefulness of developing and using approach-efferent-commands throughout all response systems (perspectives, emotions, behaviors, images) when engaging in exposure (e.g., fear of bees: Hold out  your open palm to the bee, and induce pleasant images and feelings towards the bee).  11.\\tHomework Assignment  1) Twice-a-day PR and SCD practice 2) Continuing self-monitoring of anxiety levels and worry and automatic thought identification, coping self-statement development, and labeling of cognitive errors. 3) Detection of early cues, DB and AR applications to them; Worry Outcome Monitoring and Stimulus Control applications 4) Client Daily Diary Spend a few minutes reviewing the HW assignment for the next session.  12.\\tClosure  At the end of the session, check again with the client to see if there are any questions about therapy or any of the procedures so far.

B) Check on frequency of daily PR & SCD practice, conduciveness of environment and circumstances, degree of success experienced by client in depth of relaxation achieved on their own.

Decide on specific approach tasks, as before.  12.\\tClosure  At the end of the session, check again with the client to see if they are any questions about therapy or any of the procedures so far.

Resolve any problems.  Encourage twice-a-day PR practice at conducive times and circumstances.  3.\\tCognitive Therapy: Developing Alternative Thoughts and Beliefs  Before directly confronting C\\'s thoughts and beliefs and developing alternatives, consider two initial methods that will help C to access more flexible thinking.  (a) Practice together generating multiple perspectives over neutral objects (e.g.,how many things can we see in this pencil, this cloud) and events (e.g., sit-com events and how each character reacts to it in predictable ways based on our prior knowledge of that character): Flexible thinking, multiple meanings and alternatives, possibilities.  (b) Employ distancing strategies when beginning to address one of C\\'s thoughts or beliefs (third person - How would you see another person in this situation? Apply this perspective to yourself and use it as the best guide to how others would see you; therapist as client; two-chair technique)  As the client becomes proficient at logical analysis and error detection, you should introduce the technique of exploring and developing alternative thoughts and beliefs. The client should also begin from now on to list alternatives to detected distorted thoughts on the CDD.  Throughout the remainder of therapy, keep in mind the very important ultimate goals (listed below) that we have for our clients.  The various, specific techniques in this manual represent methods for making progress towards, and ultimately achieving, these over-arching goals:  1)  One over-arching goal can be variously stated:  Living in the present, letting go of the illusion of the past and future (that exists only in their minds and worrisome thinking), expectancy-free living (I fear nothing, I hope for nothing, I am free.), surprise is better than suspense.  Initial applications of applied relaxation and cognitive therapy are not explicitly aimed at this goal right away.  Rather, the initial strategy is presented to C in terms of first creating balance and choice in their lives.  That is, C by this time recognizes the extent to which he/she is focused on and processing primarily negative states and information, and that it will be useful to begin cultivating some balance by creating periodic and increasingly frequent shifts away form anxiety via applied relaxation and perspective shifts.  We can add to this a request to begin processing more realistic (necessarily more positive) information from their daily environments in order to increase the amount of balanced information stored in memory (Non-filtering, instead ofnegative filtering; clear glasses, rather than rose-colored or brown-colored glasses).  Once more flexible, balanced information and perspectives are available and frequently used, we can begin to introduce the final step:  Letting go of all expectancies.  And a useful transition to this will be gradually introducing C to and demonstrating that no expectancy will ever perfectly match exactly what does eventually happen (can\\'t anticipate all details), and that indeed an expectation distorts actual information in its direction (well-demonstrated in cognitive research) such that we are less likely to process all information when the event does take place.  Thus, we increasingly ask C to attend to process all  information occurring in the environment, moment to moment, without any reaction or judgment.  Use the example of Monty Python and the Holy Grail (How fast does a swallow fly carrying a coconut?).  Whenever positive information is identified (e.g., worrisome outcomes don\\'t occur, coping is better than expected, self-esteem information occurs), it is important to facilitate the full processing of that information, especially at the emotional level.  So use imagery to replay the positive event and information to insure experiencing and storing the emotionally positive aspects of that information.  Research has clearly shown that imagining nonexistent events increasing the likelihood of believing that the events actually occurred; how much more so and better when the positive events have actually been occurring.  Imagery will thus facilitate the availability of the historical information that has been previously ignored.  2) Intrinsic versus extrinsic focus.  There are multiple layers of motivation for any human response at any response-system level.  Much of the motivation in the awareness of our clients has to do with external consequences, both social and nonsocial; and it is this external focus that creates the potential conditions of frustrative nonreward and thus anxiety.  E.g., they are doing or thinking things because of fear of what other might think of them.  Yet, for all responses, there are other levels of motivation also taking place that have to do with intrinsic reward, and these are the rewards to help C identify and focus upon moment to moment in order to (a) preclude anxiety and (b) increase joy, happiness, and pleasure experienced in whatever they are doing in the moment.  It is often useful in this regard to search for the original motivation for choosing this area in C\\'s life at the start (e.g., what I liked about this task, job, person, activity in the first place, despite what other meanings and motivations have become layered on top of the original approach response) or to search for what intrinsics might actually be created for the task.  So, for example: doing dishes out of love of spouse rather than seeing it as a burden keeping you form other things or even as a task whose completion will reap external rewards from the other person; writing a grant proposal for the sake of (a) learning, (b) thinking about the research area, (c) the joy of creating, (d) out of caring commitment to the staff who need future financial support (rather than for the sake of having staff like you, getting funded, or even being able to do the proposed research, all of which have external reward reference).  Once intrinsic motivation has been identified, success is now defined in terms merely of shifting attention to the intrinsic.  E.g., the definition of success in one\\'s profession: Joy.  That is the touchstone accomplishment to consider oneself successful.  3)  Closely related to the above is the distinction between focusing on process rather than outcome.  Work with C on several daily tasks and behaviors to identify what it is about the process of them that is or can be pleasureable.  Then, repeatedly in daily living, shift attention to a focus on those processes any time thoughts of outcome intrude.  E.g., the feeling of warmth and silkiness on hands when doing dishes.   4) Internal versus external consideration (Castanada; Moody Blue: All the love you\\'ve been giving was only meant for you).  This is also closely related to the above, but exclusively relevant to social evaluative concerns.  But beware: This time,internal refers to an anxiety-provoking focus, whereasexternal refers to an adaptive perspective.  I do things out of internal consideration for another person when I am focused on what the other thinks of me and have fears that I might do something that will be punished.  I do things out of external consideration when I am focused on truly doing something for the other person, not for myself.  The latter comes close to what we often callaltruism.  An example:  I might wear a suit to a formal presentation because (a) I would be afraid to wear blue jeans because the audience might think critically of me or reject me, or (b) out of respect for my audience, even though I could just as comfortably wear jeans and am not concerned for me, I am only concerned for them.  For all three of the above, be sure to incorporate imagery rehearsals of these perspectives in response to images in SCD of the relevant anxiety- or worry-triggering stimuli, in order to elicit the affective meaning of the perspectives and to store them well in memory to increase their availability.  5)  Doing Things for Yourself.  This is also interestingly related to all of the above.  Many of our clients are overly nurturant.  Because of this, they feel they are being selfish any time they put their needs ahead of anothers.  Focusing on intrinsic motivation, process, and external consideration will help in learning to do things for oneself while also maximizing the very external rewards they seek.  In the meanwhile, it is important that C comes to the view that doing things for self is the route to both less anxiety and, as a consequence, to achieving increased productivity, ability to help others, and all other external goals (e.g., the time invested now in learning and applying relaxation will lead to greater tranquility, out of which comes less anxiety, clearer thinking and decision-making, joy in the present, disinhibition of adaptive behaviors).  It is helpful here also to directly discussselfishness through Socratic method, indicating the impossibility of always satisfying others\\' needs.  Given that, then what perspective can C periodically adopt once C has decided to satisfy his/her own need? :  In this moment, satisfy your needs 100% and 0% for others in order to eliminate the conflict, in that moment, between the two conflicting needs.  6)  The Relativity ofBad Events.  \\tAnxiety relates to possible future bad events happening.  Certainly cognitive therapy contains ways of identifying whether the things we fear are indeed that bad (e.g., decatastrophizing).  But it is also useful to work with C on the issue of how relativebad events actually are.  Here is the story that exemplifies a method for encouraging C to develop a more relative view of value judgements and labeling events (in the past or in the future) asbad orcatastrophic:  Borkovec bought his first used car with his own money at age 19, a 1956 Buick convertible 4-barrel hot car.  One of the best things that ever happened to him.  Two months later, the valves blew.  One of the worst things that ever happened to him.  Because he had no car, he had to find another summer job.  He became an activity therapist at Chicago State Mental Hospital where he met Mary Siarnacki, his future wife of 28 years.  THE best thing that ever has or likely ever will happen to him.  Was it a bad event or a good event that his car blew up?  It is useful to help C loosen up all rigid beliefs and ways of thinking about things.  Even new, adaptive perspectives developed in cognitive therapy must be viewed as relatively true and adaptively useful in the moment, but that these too are usefully viewed to be constantly open to modification on the basis of new information.  They too are just hypotheses in need to periodic review and testing and evolution.    Generally Exploring Alternatives  The idea of exploring alternatives can be expressed in the following way: Very often people have a narrow or limited view of anxiety provoking or worrisome situations, because they usually focus on the worst possible interpretations or outcomes. The first step in changing your thoughts about a situation is to ask yourself whether or not there are alternative ways of looking at the situation.  For example, if you notice that your boss or your wife or husband seem angry, you may think, he or she must be upset with me; I must have done something wrong.\\' (Ask client to label the likely cognitive errors here.) When you find yourself jumping to this conclusion, you could ask yourself whether there are other reasons for the person\\'s behavior, for example, is he/she cranky because he/she feels pressure from other situations, is he/she angry at someone else, or does this person behave this way almost all the time regardless of what you do. In other situations you may be saying to yourself things like, I know I am going to fail,\\' or I know I am going to be very anxious in this situation.\\' When you find yourself making such predictions or interpretations in a situation, as we discussed before, you should treat these statements as guesses or hypotheses rather than as facts, and ask yourself How do I know that this will happen\\' or What evidence do I have that this will happen,\\' and from now on Are there other equally likely ways of looking at the situation?\\'  At this point, some clients may become skeptical and ask something likeAre you telling me that I\\'m always wrong about situations? orAre you saying that all I have to do is look on the bright side  of things? A possible therapist response to this type of questions might beNo, I recognize that some situations and some people are objectively difficult and hard to deal with. What I am saying here is that you are probably focusing too much on the negative aspects of the situation and because of this you are incorrectly jumping to anxiety-provoking conclusions. What I am suggesting here is that you begin to consider other ways of looking at anxiety provoking or worrisome situations. At this point, it may be helpful to demonstrate the utility of this approach by asking the client to provide an example from his/her own life. For example, the therapist might askCan you think of any times recently when you caught yourself jumping to a negative conclusion which created anxiety and what you later found out was incorrect interpretation or an incorrect prediction? Most clients will be able to provide some kind of example or you can derive one from previous CDD entries. The therapist can explain that a large part of the work done in the therapy sessions and at home now will be to learn how to generate alternative perspectives as soon as they identify, isolate, and challenge anxiety-provoking or worrisome thoughts.  Combating Distortions and Generating Alternatives Through Logical Syllogism  When you become aware of a painful emotion or conflict in a relationship, it is time to focus on what you are thinking. Faulty logic is at the root of many thinking errors and a great deal of human pain. A logical syllogism has three parts:  Major premise (rule) Minor premise (special case) Conclusion  Example:  All men are mortal (Major premise) Socrates is a man (Minor premise) Socrates is mortal (Conclusion)  An error made in either the major or minor premise often results in a false conclusion. Human beings operate on all sorts of hidden beliefs which become rules (major premises) in faulty syllogisms. Some typical rules are:  Any criticism means I\\'m stupid. All criticism is meant to hurt. All mistakes are intolerable. If I get rejected, I\\'ll be destroyed. People can\\'t be trusted.  The difficulty with these rules, as you have been learning already, is that they are sweeping generalizations that fail to include any alternative experience or interpretation. Because the rule (major premise) is false, the conclusion will often be false. A few examples:  All criticism is meant to hurt. (Rule, major premise) My boss just criticized me.  (Special case, minor premise)  He was trying to hurt me. If I get rejected, I\\'ll be destroyed. She just got angry and walked out. This is horrible, I\\'m destroyed.  There\\'s something wrong with people who aren\\'t married by 30. I\\'m unmarried at 30.  There is something very wrong with me.  Each of these painful conclusions is based on a rule that is fallacious. Most people believe one or more cherished rules like these. They result in misinterpretations, poor decision making, lowered self-esteem, and stressful emotions. To uncover a rule, ask yourself,What do I believe to be true about situations like this? When ______ happens, what does that usually mean? Once you identify a rule you can observe how to you apply it to specific situations in order to formulate your assumptions. Look for the exceptions to your rule.  The homework sheet that I will give you today will help you structure this work. A separate sheet should be used to examine each painful emotion or interpersonal conflict.  The Three Column Technique  If you have been saying something to yourself that is triggering anxiety, depression, or anger, write that statement down in column A. Name the distortion involved in column B. Finally, in column C rewrite the statement without the distortion. The three columns should look like this:  \\tA\\t\\t\\t       B\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tC   Original statement\\t\\tDistortion\\t\\tRewritten statement without distortion  Examples  Sandra was a member of a baby-sitting co-op. She was frequently called to take care of another member\\'s hyperactive three year old. The child had to be supervised constantly and sometimes broke things in her house. She began to dread the prospect of baby-sitting this particular little boy and felt angry when called upon to do so. She used her homework sheet as follows to begin coping with the problem. First she listed her thoughts:  I think she calls me up all the time because I\\'m the only one who will look after that kid. He screams and shrieks around the house, throws and breaks things. He\\'s a terror because she lets him get away with it, and then can\\'t stand it herself and tries to dump the problem on me. That\\'s what she\\'s doing, just dumping the problem on me. Every time I see that kid, it ruins my day. I\\'m always expecting something to break. I keep waiting for her to call, and when she does I\\'m furious. You\\'re not supposed to refuse a co-op member if you\\'ve got the time, so I\\'m stuck.  Next she labeled the errors in each thought and then rewrote a logical adaptive alternative:  A =It ruins my day...expecting something to break... keep waiting for her to call... I can\\'t stand this.  B = Filtering  C =It will ruin my day only if I let it. I don\\'t have to magnify this, it\\'s only for a little while and I can tolerate him that long. I\\'ll have a quiet morning before he comes.  A =She calls me up because I\\'m the only one who will look after her kid... she\\'s dumping her problem on me.  B = Mindreading  C = I don\\'t know why she calls me all the time, but I plan to ask her.  A =So I\\'m stuck.  B = Control  C =This is happening to me because I let it. This is a special problem that the co-op needs a special policy to handle.  A =He\\'s a terror because she lets him get away with it.  B = Blaming  C =He terrorized me because I\\'ve been putting up with the situation without trying to change it.  Eventually Sandra phoned the woman to ask why she seemed to be doing a disproportionate share of the baby-sitting. They agreed on a maximum number of hours per month. On occasions  when the child was left with her, Sandra experimented with different approaches to control his problem behavior. She gave herself some quiet time to prepare for the child\\'s arrival and told herself that she could tolerate a few hours with a hyperactive boy. She was no longer blaming, making assumptions about the motivations of others, or feeling quite so helpless. She had shifted from obsessing about pain to a focus on coping strategies.  A second example is the case of the petrified pawnbroker. There had been a rash of neighborhood robberies by a particularly brutal gunman who always wore a denim vest. The pawnbroker became increasingly anxious and was soon experiencing nausea and sweats at the sight of any sort of denim jacket. He confronted his problem in the following way:  Thoughts: I keep waiting for him to come in. I\\'m just waiting and there\\'s nothing I can do about it. He\\'s going to hit my place sooner or later. Then he\\'s going to pistol-whip me like he did one of the others. My wife says take a vacation. But I say you either face a situation or you run away from it like a coward. I\\'ll stay right here, behind the counter. I\\'ve got help, but the only way to run a shop is to stand here, right behind the counter with them.  He then labeled each error and rewrote logical alternative statements for each:  A=Either face a situation or run away like a coward.  B = Polarized thinking  C = It doesn\\'t make sense to think in black and white. I don\\'t have to judge my actions as either cowardly or brave.  A =I keep waiting from him to come in... he\\'s going to hit my place... he\\'s going to pistol-whip me.  B = Catastrophizing   C=The odds are one in ten he\\'ll hit this shop, and the odds are pretty small that I\\'ll be hurt if I cooperate  A =There\\'s nothing I can do about it.  B = Control  C =I can do something about this anxiety if I want to. I can get an attack dog, I can install a silent alarm, I can spend less time out at the counter, I can take some time off.  A =The only way to run a shop is to stand right here behind the counter you can\\'t run away.  B = Shoulds  C =Very few things in life are absolutely necessary. I don\\'t have to be behind the counter all the time. I could come out from the back room just to do appraisals.  The pawnbroker\\'s anxiety was reduced when he stopped catastrophizing and started focusing on realistic odds. He had forced himself into a corner with value judgments about his own cowardice and withshoulds about his role as a shop owner. After doing his homework he realized that he had more control of his fear than he\\'d previously thought. There was something he could do about it once he became willing to change his old distorted ways of thinking.  Often people have difficulty rewriting their statements without including the distortions. The distortions are so automatic they seem to make a lot of sense. So be sensitive to this. Also it is important that you believe what you put in column C. What you write in substitution for your old distortions will work only if it makes sense to youonly if it seems true.  Generating Alternatives Through Rational Comebacks  Listed below are rational correctives to the fifteen distorted thinking styles. Describe each to the client and provide them with  a handout to study and apply before the next session. These will give the client general strategies for developing alternative perspectives in response to their automatic thoughts and beliefs as soon as they have identified a cognitive error.  __________________________________________________________________  Client Handout: Rational Alternatives to Styles of Distorted Thinking  1. Filtering\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tShift focus; No need to magnify  You have been stuck in a mental groove, focusing on things from your environment that typically tend to frighten, sadden, or anger you. To conquer filtering you will have to deliberately shift focus. You can shift focus in two ways: First, place your attention on coping strategies to deal with the problem rather than obsessing about the problem itself. Second, categorize your primary mental theme as: Loss, Injustice, or ________(fill in your own theme). If your theme is loss, focus instead on what you do have that is of value. If your theme is danger, focus on things in your environment that represent comfort and safety. If your theme is injustice (including stupidity, incompetence, etc.), shift your attention to what people do or what you do that does meet with your approval.  When you are filtering you usually end up magnifying your problems. To combat magnifying, stop using words like terrible, awful, disgusting, horrendous, etc. In particular, banish the phraseI can\\'t stand it. You can stand it, because history shows that human beings can survive almost any psychological blow and can endure incredible physical pain. You can get used to and cope with almost anything. Try saying to yourself phrases such asNo need to magnify andI can cope.  2. Polarized Thinking\\t\\t\\t\\tNo black and white judgments;Think in percentages  The key to overcoming polarized thinking is to stop making black or white judgments. People are not either happy or sad, loving or rejecting, brave of cowardly, smart or stupid. They fall somewhere along a continuum. they are a little bit of each. Human beings are just too complex to be reduced to dichotomous judgments. If you have to make these kinds of ratings, think in terms of percentages:About 30% of me is scared to death, and 70% is holding on and coping... about 60% of the time he seems terribly preoccupied with himself, but there\\'s the 40% when he can be really generous... 5% of the time I\\'m an ignoramus, the rest of the time I do all right.  3. Overgeneralization\\t\\t\\tQuantify; Evidence for conclusions? There are no absolutes  Overgeneralization is simply the tendency to exaggerate, the propensity to take a button and sew a vest on it. You can fight this tendency by quantifying instead of using words like huge, awful, massive, minuscule, etc. Moreover, you can examine how much evidence you really have for your conclusion. If the conclusion is based on one or two cases, a single mistake, or one small symptom, then throw it out till you have more convincing proof. Use this variant of the three column technique:   Evidence for my conclusion  Evidence against my conclusion   Alternative conclusion  If you overgeneralize you think in absolutes. You should therefore avoid statements and assumptions that require the use of words such as every, all, always, none, never, everybody, and nobody. Thoughts and statements that include these words ignore the exceptions and shades of gray. To become more flexible, use instead words such as may, sometimes,  and often. Be particularly sensitive to absolute predictions about the future such as,No one will ever love me. They are extremely dangerous because they can become self-fulfilling prophecies.  4. Mind Reading\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCheck it out; Evidence for conclusions  Mind reading is the tendency to make inferences about how people feel and think. In the long run, you are probably better off making no inferences about people at all. Either believe what they tell you or hold no belief at all until some conclusive evidence comes your way. Treat all of your notions about people as hypotheses to be tested and checked out by asking them. If you lack direct information from the person involved, but have other evidence, evaluate your conclusion using the three column technique above.  5. Catastrophizing\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Realistic odds  Catastrophizing is the royal road to anxiety. As soon as you catch yourself, make an honest assessment of the situation in terms of odds or percent of probability. Are the chances one in 100,000 (.001%)? One in a thousand (.1%)? One in twenty (5%)? Looking at odds helps you realistically evaluate whatever is frightening you.  6. Personalization\\t\\t\\tCheck it out; Evidence for conclusion;Why risk comparisons?  If your tendency is to personalize, force yourself to prove what the boss\\'s frown has to do with you. Check it out. If you can\\'t ask the person, use the three column technique shown above to test your conclusions. Make no conclusions unless you are satisfied that you have reasonable evidence and proof. It is also important to abandon the habit of comparing yourselfnegatively or positivelywith other people. Comparisons are an exciting form of gambling. Sometimes you win and really outshine someone else. But when you lose, you set yourself up for a blow to your self-esteem and maybe the beginning of a long, deep depression. Your worth doesn\\'t depend on being better than others, so why start the comparison gamble?  In the beginning whenever you identify a personalization occurring, immediately (though possibly temporarily) shift your perspective by attributing 100% externally.  Later, when you have quiet time to yourself, you can logically analyse the situation and determine whether any internal attribution is indeed relevant.  This is especially true if you have a tendency to immediately blame yourself for things that happen, take on too much or all of the responsibility, and ignore the possibility that the other person is contributing totally or partly to what happened.  7. Control Fallacies\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI make it happen; Each one is responsible  Aside from natural disasters, you are responsible for what happens in your world. You make it happen. If you are unhappy there are specific choices you have made, and continue to make, that have the byproduct of unhappiness. You usually achieve in life whatever your top priority is. For example, if security is more important than anything else, you may have it at the expense of passion and excitement. You may long for excitement, but security was the higher priority. Ask yourself,What choices have I made that resulted in this situation? What decisions can I make now to change it?  The omnipotence fallacy is the opposite side of the coin from the external control fallacy. Instead of everyone else being responsible for your problems, you are responsible for everyone else\\'s problems. If someone is in pain, it\\'s your responsibility to do something about it. The fault is with you if you don\\'t take up the burdens of others. The key to overcoming the omnipotence fallacy is to recognize that each one is responsible for himself. We are all captains of our own ships, making the decisions that steer our lives. If someone is in pain, he or she has the  ultimate responsibility to overcome or accept it. There is a difference between generosity and the slavish adherence to a conviction that you have to help everybody. Also remember, part of respecting others includes letting them live their own lives, suffer their own pains, and solve their own problems.  8. Fallacy of Fairness\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPreference vs. fairness  Outside of a court of law, the concept of fairness is too dangerous to use. The word fair is a nice disguise for personal preferences and wants. What you want is fair, what the other person wants is bogus. Be honest with yourself and the other person. Say what you want or prefer without dressing it up in the fallacy of fairness.  9. Blaming\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI make it happen; Each one is responsible  It is your responsibility to assert your needs, say no, or go elsewhere. The other person is not responsible for knowing or helping you meet your needs. No one else can really be at fault if you, a responsible adult, are distressed or unhappy. Focus on the choices you have made that created this situation. Examine what options you have now for coping with it.   There is a difference between taking responsibility and turning the blame on yourself. Taking responsibility means accepting the consequences of your own choices. Blaming yourself means attacking your own self-esteem and labeling yourself bad if you make a mistake. Taking responsibility doesn\\'t imply that you are also responsible for what happens to others. Blaming yourself for another person\\'s problems is a form of self-aggrandizement. It means you think you are having more impact on their lives than they are.  10. Shoulds\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFlexible rules; Flexible values  First, replace anyshould withcould immediately. Could indicates choice, possibility, openness (without eliminating the possible choice of theshoulded option).  Re-examine and question any personal rules or expectations that include the words should, ought, or must. Flexible rules and expectations don\\'t use these words because there are always exceptions and special circumstances. Think of at least three exceptions to your rule, and then imagine all the exceptions there must be that you can\\'t think of.  You may get irritated when people don\\'t act according to your values. But your personal values are just thatpersonal. They may work for you but, as missionaries have discovered all over the world, they don\\'t always work for others. People just aren\\'t all the same.  The key is to focus on each person\\'s uniqueness, his or her particular needs, limitations, fears, and pleasures. Because it is impossible to know all of these complex interrelations even with intimates, you can\\'t be certain whether your values apply to another. You are entitled to an opinion, but allow for the possibility of being wrong. Also, allow for other people to find different things important.  11. Emotional Reasoning\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFeelings can lie  What you feel is entirely dependent on what you think. If you have distorted thoughts, your feelings won\\'t have validity. Your feelings can lie to you. In fact, if you\\'re feeling depressed or anxious all the time, it\\'s almost certain they are lying to you. There is nothing sacred or automatically true about what you feel. If you feel unattractive or feel foolish and embarrassed, you tend to believe yourself ugly or a fool. But stop a minute. Maybe it  isn\\'t true and you are suffering for nothing. Be skeptical about your feelings and examine them as you would a used car.  12. Fallacy of Change\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI make it happen  When you try to push people to change, you are asking them to be different so you can be happy. The assumption is that your happiness is in some way dependent on them and on how they behave. Your happiness depends on you, on each of the decisions you make. You have to decide whether to leave or stay, work as a baker or an electrician, say yes or no. Each person makes it happen for himself or herself. It\\'s dangerous to ask someone else to make it happen for you because people resist when they are pressured to change. If they do change they often resent the person who made them change.  13. Global Labeling\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBe specific  Global labels are usually false because they focus on only a single characteristic or behavior but imply that it\\'s the whole picture. Rather than applying global labels, you can limit your observations to a specific case. Ask yourself if a case is always true, or only true now, or only true some of the time.  14. Being Right\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tActive listening  If you\\'ve always got to be right, you don\\'t listen. You can\\'t afford to. Listening might lead you to conclude that you are wrong sometimes. The key to overcoming being right is active listening. As an active listener you participate in communication by repeating what you think you\\'ve heard in order to make sure you really understand what\\'s been said to you. This checking out process helps two people who disagree to appreciate each other\\'s point of view. A proportionately greater amount of time is spent trying to understand the other person than in devising your own rebuttals and attacks. Remember that other people believe what they are saying as strongly as you believe in your convictions, and that there is not always one right answer. Focus on what you can learn from the other person\\'s opinion.  15. Heaven\\'s Reward Fallacy\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe reward is now  This distorted thinking style accepts pain and unhappiness because those who do good are rewarded in the end. But if doing good means you are doing things you don\\'t want to do and sacrificing things you resent giving up, then you are likely to receive no reward at all. You\\'ll become so bitter and unhappy that people will steer clear of you.  In reality, the reward is now. Your relationships, your progress toward your goals, and the care you give to people you love should be intrinsically rewarding. Most days, your emotional bank balance should be in the black. If you are drained, running in the red ink for days or weeks at a time, something is wrong. You need to arrange your activities to provide some here-and-now reward, dropping or sharing the activities that chronically drain you. Heaven is a long way off and you can get very tired waiting.  It is part of your responsibility to those you care about not to do things that will lead you to feel resentful. Remember that you wouldn\\'t want others doing things for you that they didn\\'t want to do.  \\t  As you work with the client on General Generation of Alternatives, Syllogistic Logic, and Rational Comebacks, be sure to apply these to specific client cognitions previously identified via session d iscussions of Challenging Automatic Thoughts and CDD entries. You should have these ready to go before each session.  As central, frequent automatic thoughts or beliefs are identified and replaced with adaptive alternatives, it may be useful for the client to put both the original thought and the adaptive thought on an index card for ready use during the day. Be sure again to emphasize the importance of daily catching early anxiety-provoking thoughts and challenging them and replacing them rapidly with adaptive perspectives.  4.\\tContinue application training, discussion, questions and problem resolution.  Application training for this and subsequent sessions focuses on developing with the client methods and strategies for the increasingly rapid deployment of various relaxation strategies to increasingly early cue detections. This is accomplished over the sessions by:  a) More detailed discussion of events during the previous week, isolating external and internal early cues that were not previously noticed or responded to with a coping strategy. Therapist should use imaginal reconstruction of such events, slow-motion replay, role-playing, etc. to facilitate such identifications.  b) Detailed discussion of upcoming days and anticipated stress events (mild as well as more severe), identification of likely, early cues, and agreement upon diverse coping methods that will be employed.   c) Training in the varieties of applied relaxation methods (cue-controlled relaxation, differential relaxation, imagery relaxation, diaphragmatic breathing,letting go metaphors) to be flexibly employed in anticipation of, response to, and recovery from the above identified cues, as well as for the development of a generalized, relaxed life style throughout the day.  Follow Bernstein and Borkovec\\'s manual for differential relaxation training, and include walks around the office and outside of the office to demonstrate, practice, and encourage generalization of its use to daily living.  d) Informal self-control desensitization. During all of the above, have the client practice deployment of coping strategies in response to the various cues identified in a) and b) above. With this technique in place, we now have three conditions in therapy under which the client is practicing the rehearsal of coping applications: formal SCD, informal SCD, and applications in-session when therapist or client notice incipient anxiety cues (#5 below). This variety of circumstances of rehearsal will facilitate the likelihood of coping response applications by the client whenever they notice cues in their daily life.  e. Special issues for GAD clients and relaxation training and application:  -Yerkes-Dodson: Relaxation will lead to greater efficiency, productivity, clearer thinking \\t- Fear of less productivity? :  ABAB experiments  - Nonjudgmental Attention and Processing of Present Moment Sensations and Information (i.e., Mindfulness). o\\t-Problem of trying to relax (achievement, perfectionism):  Movement toward tranquility o\\t-Past and future is always an illusion; anxiety is always one of these; It\\'s you creating this reality o\\t-Discovery: Watching for what cognitions, feelings, and behaviors will emerge from tranquility o\\t-Present-moment focus of attention o\\tSensation training: no reaction to reaction; no elaborations or judgments o\\tAttend and process present moment sensations and information; no reaction to it o\\tAsk for examples of present moment absorption: Fireworks, pleasant tasks, hobbies, soapy o\\tdishes  (and homework it: discover little present-moment joys)  5.\\tIn Session PR application.  As in Session Two, sometime in the beginning of this session, and each session from now on, be sure to ask the client to rate his/her present level of anxiety and to briefly relax it away (and re-rate). This request should be repeated at least 3-5 times per session. At first the therapist can use behavioral cues as prompts for anxiety increases (i.e. tapping fingers, facial tension, etc.), and share these cues with the client. Later on, transfer this responsibility to the client asking him/her to report any detected shift in anxiety level detected during the session. These shifts will most likely occur in the early parts of the session, while discussing the client\\'s week and anxiety symptoms.   6.\\tSelf-Statement training and SCD scene selection: Same as Session 5.   7.\\t4 Muscle Group PR Training: Same as Session 5.  8.\\tSCD: Same as Session 5.  9.\\tRRS  10.\\tDiscussion of Experience, Resolution of Problems, Practice Reminder: Same as Session 5.  11.\\tHomework Assignment  1) Twice-a-day PR & SCD practice 2) Continuing self-monitoring of anxiety levels, worry and automatic thought identification, coping self-statement developments, and labeling cognitive errors. 3) Detection of early cues, DB and AR applications to them; Worry Outcome Monitoring and Stimulus Control applications 4) Use of alternative thoughts & beliefs upon early cue detection & entry of alternatives on CDD. 4) Client Daily Diary 5) Study Client Handout: Rational Comebacks to Distorted Thinking  In addition to the above homework, the client should be encouraged to purposely enter anxiety provoking situations and apply his/her newly acquired coping skills and to test belief hypotheses.

This technique is usually used after a detailed analysis of faulty logic and generation of alternatives and is particularly useful when dealing with worries. After the therapist and client have subjected the client\\'s predictions or interpretations to analysis of faulty logic, the client may acknowledge that his/her negative or catastrophic prediction is probably not as likely as he/she originally thought. The therapist can support the client\\'s reinterpretation of the situation, but then go one step further by asking,Let\\'s assume for the moment that the worst possible thing actually happened. What would happen then? Decatastrophizing orwhat if can be introduced in the following way:We have just looked at some ways that you can arrive at a more realistic interpretation and less negative predictions about certain situations, but sometimes it can be helpful to ask yourself, what if the worst were actually to come true?\\' For example, if you\\'re worried about failing a test or having an argument with your boss, you may be able to find errors in your thinking which permit you to reevaluate this possibility. However, at that point it may be helpful to shift gears in your thinking and ask yourself, Well, what if the worst possible thing were to come true?\\' What if I did fail the test or what if I did have an argument with my boss?\\' Your first reaction to this question is probably something like, `that would be awful or terrible\\' or, my life, career, marriage, etc., would be ruined.\\' However, you may find that when you think carefully and critically about these assumptions, and subject them to analysis of errors, that you have prematurely jumped to negative conclusions. For example, when you think about the consequences of failing an exam, you may automatically say to yourself, If I fail this exam, then I will probably flunk out of college.\\' When you make this prediction explicit, and then subject it to logical analysis, you may find that you have made some sort of error  such as overgeneralizing from a limited set of examples, overlooking other evidence, etc. Similarly, when you think about the consequences of stumbling over your words while making a presentation to your colleagues, you may automatically think they will think, I\\'m a fool,\\' and not even consider alternative possibilities such as a) they will not even notice you stumbling over your words, or b) even if they do notice, no one will really care. You can even take this one step further and ask yourself, well, what if some of the people in the audience do think that I look foolish, does it really matter what these people think?\\' As you begin focusing in on these thoughts, you will probably experience an increase in anxiety, because the thoughts themselves are anxiety-provoking. However, you should keep on with your logical analysis of your thoughts and through this process, the thoughts themselves will become less anxiety-provoking, and easier to change. The general strategy of decatastrophizing is to encourage the client to specifically outline the consequences of the feared event. By now, the client\\'s specific prediction has already been subjected to analysis of faulty logic, but at some point the therapist shifts the focus of discussion and asks the client to think more precisely about what would happen if his/her worst fear were actually to come true. In the case of a client who is concerned about making a mistake on his new job, therapist questions would be,Suppose you do make a mistake in the first week? orWhat if your supervisor does tell you that he\\'s unhappy with some aspects of your work?  Once the client has discussed some of the expected consequences of the feared event, he/she and the therapist are in a position to evaluate whether in fact these consequences would be intolerable as the client believes they would be or whether the client\\'s anxiety or embarrassment would be time-limited. Be sure to focus on both external and internal consequences. Very often the feared event has implications for the client\\'s evaluation of him/herself, the evaluation is usually being global and overgeneralized. For example, a client may reportIf I fail this test, it means I am a poor test taker and a bad student orIf I make a mistake in my new job then I\\'m an incompetent worker. Should such cognitions be uncovered, the therapist should use techniques described in the analysis of faulty logic to help the client recognize that such conclusions are unwarranted generalizations. It\\'s also useful during decatastrophizing to (a) have the client give probability estimates at each step and (b) generate alternative perspectives on each step and explore ways of coping, should each step occur, since a detailed discussion of feared consequences also permits exploration of measures which can be taken to correct the situation. For example, the client who fears making mistakes on a new job may not have considered the possibility that his/her supervisor might recognize that this is a normal part of the breaking-in process and would be willing to answer questions and offer assistance if the client simply asks. Because he/she has avoided thinking the situation through, the client may have overlooked many of these straightforward rescue factors, and a consideration of these  factors may put the feared event into a more realistic, less catastrophic perspective.  Anti-Catastrophic Reappraisal  Also, teach the client anti-catastrophic reappraisal method, especially for worry topics. Most people are consistent in their thinking. Hence, in different situations and at different times they distort reality in the same way. The most common type of distortion iscatastrophizing, or the extreme exaggeration of impending doom. Many clients observe a minor threat in the environment and believe the worst conceivable danger is imminent. After years of practice, their exaggerations become habitual, causing chronic anxiety and a constant dread of the environment.  What these clients fail to recognize is that the word catastrophe implies a great calamity, misfortune, or disaster. Although clients may accurately perceive some danger in a given situation, in catastrophizing they grossly exaggerate the degree of danger, along with its potential for damage. Their brains expand pain into torture, embarrassment into disgrace, an unpleasant experience into an intolerable one.  The best counters to catastrophic beliefs are narrow, in that they specifically attack active elements in the irrational thought, which usually amounts to a gross overgeneralization. The therapist can attack this element by telling the client to think of the best conceivable outcome, overstating the best outcome instead of the worst. This new interpretation overcorrects the negative emotion caused by the catastrophizing, improving the probability that the final affective response will approximate reality.  Method:  a. List the situations the client catastrophizes. b. Record the damage the client anticipates for each situation. c. On a continuum from 1 to 10, record the extent of the anticipated damage. d. After discussing counter-catastrophizing with clients, record the best possible thing that could happen in each of the situations. Again, mark the extent of the damage for this outcome. e. Have the client decide, based on past experience, whether the catastrophic or best possible outcome is most likely to occur. f. Where appropriate, have the client use the continuum to predict danger in upcoming situations which are feared. After the event actually occurs, have the client check the scale to see whether the anticipated level of damage occurred. g. Clients should practice counter-catastrophizing regularly until they can more realistically assess anticipated damage.  Example  Dean, a top businessman, was referred by his private physician. He was unusually successful, having presented his expert advice to major corporations worldwide for many years. Despite this, he suffered from chronic anxiety and had panic attacks before each presentation. A year and a half of chlordiazepoxide treatment brought no reduction in his anxiety. As is typical in this type of anxiety, the client thought the same core belief before each presentation. He imagined that his head would start shaking because he was nervous, whereupon all the corporate executives would discover he wasn\\'t the cool, calm  professional he pretended to be. He imagined this tick would destroy his facade, and everyone in the audience would see hiscowardice.  This man\\'s deeply rooted core belief was that he was basically inferior and needed to hide behind a competent facade. Letting others see behind the facade would mean complete and instantaneous rejection. The damage would be beyond repair. It would be the worst possible thing that could ever happen to him.  The client\\'s core attitude can be broken down into specific sub-beliefs, as follows:  a. Everyone in the audience would ignore what he was saying the minute they saw his head shake. b. They would know he was a total fake and would never believe in him again. c. Because they would see him as a sissy and not a real man, they would never associate with him again. d. Since these top level executives wouldn\\'t want to be around such a wimp, he would never be able to give his lectures again, he would lose all his male friends, women would hate his weakness, and he would be poor, alone, and destitute.  For each one of these thoughts, a catastrophe scale was made. AnX on each scale would indicate the extent of the predicted damage, were the event to occur.  How catastrophic would it be if...everyone saw my tick?...the audience concentrated on it?...the audience thought I was a total fake?...the audience knew I was a sissy?...I lost all my income, and all my male and female friends?  Next the best possible things that could happen were listed and marked with the anticipated damage from these outcomes on the same scale. The outcomes were that few people would see his tick, and those who did wouldn\\'t concentrate on it. No one would think he was a fake or sissy, and he would lose no income or friends. The client rated all of these outcomes around a zero damage level.  By comparing the ratings for the worst and best possible outcomes, it became apparent that the client was catastrophizing by a factor of eight.  A whole series of other continua were then made, taken from past such events. By comparing what had happened in prior situations to what the client had predicted would happen, very little damage was found to have actually occurred and the best possible outcomes were consistently closer to reality than the worst. In fact, the client could not think of a single time, out of hundreds of situations, when anything remotely similar to his worst predictions had eventuated.  For the next six weeks, this man predicted the best and worst possible outcome of each presentation he was about to make, along with the estimated damage. The next day he went back to his scale and determined with prediction was most accurate. Without exception, thebest possible outcome occurred.  The use of the continuum isn\\'t essential to this method, but it generally helps clarify the client\\'s level of catastrophizing.  The client often asks,What if the worst thing imaginable does happen, even though it\\'s highly unlikely? Shouldn\\'t I worry about  that? In this situation, you can point out to clients that if they feared all low probability events, they would have to hide in caves to avoid meteors, avoid crossing streets to keep from getting hit by trucks, and stop eating food to keep from being poisoned. Even though these things can and do happen, we can still be happy. Our job is to avoid probable dangers, not every conceivable catastrophe.  4.\\tContinue application training, discussion, questions and problem resolution.  Application training for this and subsequent sessions focuses on developing with the client methods and strategies for the increasingly rapid deployment of various relaxation strategies to increasingly early cue detections. This is accomplished over the sessions by:  a) More detailed discussion of events during the previous week, isolating external and internal early cues that were not previously noticed or responded to with a coping strategy. Therapist should use imaginal reconstruction of such events, slow-motion replay, role-playing, etc. to facilitate such identifications.  b) Detailed discussion of upcoming days and anticipated stress events (mild as well as more severe), identification of likely, early cues, and agreement upon diverse coping methods that will be employed.   c) Training in the varieties of applied relaxation methods (cue-controlled relaxation, differential relaxation, imagery relaxation, diaphragmatic breathing,letting go metaphors) to be flexibly employed in anticipation of, response to, and recovery from the above identified cues, as well as for the development of a generalized, relaxed life style throughout the day.  Follow Bernstein and Borkovec\\'s manual for differential relaxation training, and include walks around the office and outside of the office to demonstrate, practice, and encourage generalization of its use to daily living.  d) Informal self-control desensitization. During all of the above, have the client practice deployment of coping strategies in response to the various cues identified in a) and b) above. With this technique in place, we now have three conditions in therapy under which the client is practicing the rehearsal of coping applications: formal SCD, informal SCD, and applications in-session when therapist or client notice incipient anxiety cues (#5 below). This variety of circumstances of rehearsal will facilitate the likelihood of coping response applications by the client whenever they notice cues in their daily life.  e. Special issues for GAD clients and relaxation training and application:  -Yerkes-Dodson: Relaxation will lead to greater efficiency, productivity, clearer thinking \\t- Fear of less productivity? :  ABAB experiments  - Nonjudgmental Attention and Processing of Present Moment Sensations and Information (i.e., Mindfulness). o\\t-Problem of trying to relax (achievement, perfectionism):  Movement toward tranquility o\\t-Past and future is always an illusion; anxiety is always one of these; It\\'s you creating this reality o\\t-Discovery: Watching for what cognitions, feelings, and behaviors will emerge from tranquility o\\t-Present-moment focus of attention o\\tSensation training: no reaction to reaction; no elaborations or judgments o\\tAttend and process present moment sensations and information; no reaction to it o\\tAsk for examples of present moment absorption: Fireworks, pleasant tasks, hobbies, soapy o\\tdishes  (and homework it: discover little present-moment joys)  5.\\tIn Session PR application.  As in Session Two, sometime in the beginning of this session, and each session from now on, be sure to ask the client to rate his/her present level of anxiety and relax it away (and re-rate). This request should be repeated at least 3-5 times per session. At first the therapist can use behavioral cues as prompts for anxiety increases (i.e. tapping fingers, facial tension, etc.), and share these cues with the client. At this point the responsibility for recognizing early cues should have transferred to the client, with the client spontaneously reporting these shifts in his/her level of anxiety and tension, and following this immediately with a relaxation response.  6.\\tSelf-statement training and SCD scene selection: Same as Session 5.  7.\\tRelaxation By Recall Training   \\tThe recall procedure differs quite markedly from all of the preceding procedures in that it does not require the client to exert muscular tension. It does require full use of the client\\'s increased ability to focus on tension and relaxation. Before beginning the initial recall session the client should be fully informed about the procedures to come. The therapist should be certain that the client understands these procedures and is ready to attempt them.  Relaxation with recall employs the same four muscle groups which had been employed in the previous procedures; i.e. both arms as the first group; face and neck as the second; chest, shoulders, back, and stomach as the third; and legs and feet as the fourth.  In this procedure, the therapist need only provide for two sequential events: first, the careful focusing of the client\\'s attention on any tension in a particular muscle group, and second, the instruction to the client to recall the feelings associated with the release of that tension. In order to help the client focus attention the therapist could say,O.K., now I\\'d like you to focus all your attention on the muscles of the arms and hands and very carefully identify any feelings of tightness or tension that might be present there now. Notice where this tension is and what it feels like.  Following the focusing of attention, the therapist can go directly into the relaxation mode by saying, for example,O.K., and relax, just recalling what it was like when you released these muscles, just letting them go and allowing them to become more and more deeply relaxed. The therapist should continue the indirect suggestionpatter for about 30-45 seconds. Thus, this procedure is analogous to the tension-release system, the only difference being that the actual production of tension is eliminated. At the conclusion of the 30-45 seconds of indirect relaxation suggestion the therapist should ask for a signal from the client if the particular muscle group feels completely relaxed. IF the client signals, the therapist should continue to the next muscle group. If the signal is not forthcoming, the therapist should say, for example,O.K., again I\\'d like you to focus all your attention on the muscles of the arms and hands, this time very carefully identifying where the residual tension is, focusing all of your attention on it, noticing what it feels like. The therapist should then give the relaxation cue and another 30-45 seconds of indirect suggestions involving focused recall of relaxation.  If serious trouble is encountered in getting a particular muscle group relaxed the therapist should employ the earlier procedure of tensing the muscle group. The therapist should, however, continue to attempt to use recall on all other muscle groups, and in fact should encourage the client to use recall on all groups in home practice sessions. The client should be led to expect that practicing will increase his/her skill with the recall procedure ant that initial difficulties will be overcome; this expectation is almost always fulfilled.  With the exception of elimination of the actual tension production, this procedure is in other respects identical (e.g. in terms of final assessment and termination procedure) to the earlier stages of training.  Proceed with actual training, as in Session Two, using the recall  procedure.  8.\\tSCD: Same as Session 5.  9.\\tRRS  10.\\tDiscussion of Experience, Resolution of Problems, Practice Reminder  11.\\tHomework Assignment  1) Twice-a-day Recall PR practice 2) Continuing self-monitoring of anxiety levels, worry and automatic thought identification, coping self-statement developments, labeling errors, logical analysis, alternative thought generation and application, and decatastrophizing and reappraisals 3) Detection of early cues, DB and AR applications to them; Worry Outcome Monitoring and Stimulus Control applications 4) Client Daily Diary  In addition to the above homework, the client should be encouraged to begin purposely entering anxiety provoking situations and applying his/her newly acquired coping skills and to test belief hypotheses. Decide on specifics, as before.  12.\\tPaperwork  Client In-Session Forms \\tRRS \\tTherapy evaluation form \\tWorking Alliance Inventory Client Forms to be taken home (and returned next session). \\tClient Daily Diary \\tRelaxation Practice/Application form (RPA) \\tSCD Practice Form  Therapist in session forms \\tObserver Rating Form \\tSCD Rating Form   \\t \\tSESSION 11  1.\\tAgenda for today  Briefly outline today\\'s session for the C.  2.\\tReview of Week and Homework  A) Collect forms from the last session. Then review the client\\'s week according to the CDD, discuss anxiety level self-monitoring, early cue detection, automatic thought and worry identification and outcome information, labeling errors, logical analysis, alternative thought generation and application, application of PR, SCD and DB, and coping self-statement developments, and any exposure experiences; Worry Outcome Monitoring and Stimulus Control applications.  B) Check on frequency of daily PR and SCD practice, conduciveness of environment and circumstances, degree of success experienced by clients in depth of relaxation achieved on their own. Review efforts of decatastrophizing and reappraisal.  Resolve any problems.  Encourage twice-a-day PR practice at conducive times and circumstances.  3.\\tCognitive Therapy: Behavioral Experiments for Testing Hypotheses and Causal Attributions  Clients may need help in setting up homework tasks to challenge irrational assumptions. It is often difficult to eliminate frightening thoughts by using alternative thoughts alone. Clients may retain beliefs that certain kinds of activity will lead to certain negative outcomes. Thus at some stage in therapy, clients may need help in constructing homework experiments that will test the validity of the assumptions. Since the assumptions of individual clients will vary, it is difficult to lay down precise rules about the nature of the appropriate homework experiment. In general, therapists need to be guided by the continued presence of apparently irrational assumptions that form an obstacle to further progress and that offer practical possibilities for testing. Many of these homework tasks have an element of in vivo exposure. This type of exposure is more than just the goal of extinction associated with it:  It is used to allow the client to test the accuracy of his/her predictions based on anxiety-evoking thoughts or beliefs. The effect of such tests are often maximized by having the client make a clear prediction of expected outcome (both external and internal), and of its implications. Subsequent discussion can thus be based on any mis-match between the client\\'s anticipation and the actual result of the experiment.  Hypothesis testing is a technique which is designed to encourage the client to monitor negative cognitions and to make more realistic predictions about feared events. For each, be sure that the client writes out catastrophic predictions about various situations he/she is likely to encounter during the week. Client has already been doing this for each worry. At subsequent sessions, the client and the therapist can examine the evidence which either supports or refutes these predictions. In this manner, the client can experience directly that few, if any, of his dire predictions come true. The therapist can arrange a small scale experiment  during the session or have the client keep a record of the dire predictions which he/she makes during the week. In both of these cases, the client and therapist can evaluate the accuracy of these predictions by examining the evidence or data.  Many anxious clients make catastrophic predictions about the effects of anxiety on their ability to function. A client might sayI am too anxious to read, orI am too anxious to make a phone call. If the client is experiencing anxiety in the session, predictions such as these can be tested during the session by actually having the client attempt these activities. Upon completing such an experiment, many clients may protest that theydid not do well, but the therapist can point out that, even though their performance may not have been perfect, the client was able to do it, contrary to their prediction. Of course, the therapist should not attempt such an experiment until he/she has some idea of the kinds of activities which the client can successfully carry out.  Other catastrophic predictions such asI wouldn\\'t be able to drive during a panic attack orIf I am preoccupied with worry while I\\'m at home alone with my baby, I won\\'t be able to care for him/her can be evaluated on the basis of the client\\'s weekly records. Very often these records contain clear evidence that the client can, in fact, drive, care for children, and carry out a number of activities while experiencing rather severe anxiety. As the therapy progresses and the client is able to handle anxiety more effectively, there will be more examples of catastrophic predictions which are not accurate.  Finally, be sure to focus on experiments aimed at the need to worry. Clients often have a superstitious sense that worrying either magically makes the feared outcomes less likely or that their worrying actually does prepare them for the worst or leads to solutions. Monitoring of worry outcomes for the past weeks provides some data relevant to these hypotheses. Ask the client to further test the specifics of these predictions by deliberately not worrying, and see what outcomes occur.  Cognitive Therapy: Causal Attributions  One other area to cover for error detection and creation of alternatives has to do with the dimensions of causal attributions and their importance in guiding thoughts and beliefs. Work with the client to help him/her understand the distinctions below and how to use them in monitoring their automatic thoughts and in generating alternatives.  Causal attributions are explanations people develop to account for their behavior, feelings or circumstances. Causal attributions are individual hypotheses or self-explanations about causality. There are actual causes for events which may or may not be apparent, and there are perceived or attributed causes. Causal attributions are the latter, theories about the cause(s) of one\\'s behavior, etc.  For example, a client fails a test. This much is fact. The client is asked to generate possible explanations for the failure (e.g., she didn\\'t study adequately, didn\\'t do homework, she is not intelligent, she was sick, she was upset over a fight with her boyfriend, she had a poor instructor, the test was unfair). Any one of these explanations may be the reason for her failure, or a number of actual reasons may account for her test  performance.    The client is also likely to explain or account for her failure to herself in some way. Whether her explanation is true or not, the kind of causal attribution she makes about her failure is likely to have an emotional impact. She is asked to compare the emotional impact of each of the following causal attributions:  I was sick that day  vs. I\\'m terrible at math.  Causal attribution may take several general forms. The first form of causal attribution is internal versus external. For example, the client might claim her failure is due to something about her (internal), e.g.,I\\'m a poor test-taker.I didn\\'t study.  She might account for her failure by referring to causes outside of herself, i.e.,The test wasn\\'t fair.There was too much noise outside for a person to concentrate. This is an example of an external attribution.  The second form of causal attribution is stable versus temporary or unstable. The client might believe her failure is due to something permanent about herself or her situation which led to her failure, i.e.,I\\'m not capable of learning math.I\\'m stupid. This would be an example of stable cause.  Or, she might believe some temporary cause is responsible for her performance, e.g.,I was sick that day.The instructor didn\\'t tell us the lecture material was going to be on the test.  A third form of causal attribution is global versus specific. If the client believed her failure was due to something general about herself, e.g.,I\\'m not intelligent,I\\'m not a good student. This would be an example of a global attribution. On the other hand, if she believed her failure to be due to a specific cause,Dr. Jones\\' tests are really tricky,I had a headache that morning then this would be considered a specific attribution.  The type of causal attribution one makes can have a significant impact on how one feels and acts, and their beliefs about how effectively they might act in the future. For example, a person whoexplains a disappointing experience to himself in global, stable, and internal terms is more likely to feel depressed and hopeless.  What does this have to do with generalized anxiety? Often, people with GAD develop the habit of attributing failure to internal, stable, global causes and success to external, temporary and specific causes.  The type of causal attributions people make about their coping practice experiences can affect their moral, self-confidence and future efforts to cope. I was only able to do it successfully because Bill was there. \\t(EXTERNAL-UNSTABLE-SPECIFIC)  is compared with I was anxious today, but I decided to cope with the feelings. I was able to handle it without help.  \\t(INTERNAL-UNSTABLE-SPECIFIC)  Impact of these two causal attributions on feelings, behavior and self-confidence is discussed. Causal attributions can also be subject to challenge and rebuttal, e.g., It\\'s true, Bill was around, but I was able to cope because I chose  to.  4.\\tContinue application training, discussion, questions and problem resolution.  Application training for this and subsequent sessions focuses on developing with the client methods and strategies for the increasingly rapid deployment of various relaxation strategies to increasingly early cue detections. This is accomplished over the sessions by:  a) More detailed discussion of events during the previous week, isolating external and internal early cues that were not previously noticed or responded to with a coping strategy.

Follow Bernstein and Borkovec\\'s manual for differential relaxation training, and include walks around the office and outside of the office to demonstrate, practice, and encourage generalization of its use to daily living.  d) Informal self-control desensitization. During all of the above, have the client practice deployment of coping strategies in response to the various cues identified in a) and b) above. With this technique in place, we now have three conditions in therapy under which the client is practicing the rehearsal of coping applications: formal SCD, informal SCD, and applications in-session when therapist or client notice incipient anxiety cues (#5 below), and the above informal rehearsals. This variety of circumstances of rehearsal will facilitate the likelihood of coping response applications by the client whenever they notice cues in their daily life.  e. Special issues for GAD clients and relaxation training and application:  -Yerkes-Dodson: Relaxation will lead to greater efficiency, productivity, clearer thinking \\t- Fear of less productivity? :  ABAB experiments  - Nonjudgmental Attention and Processing of Present Moment Sensations and Information (i.e., Mindfulness). o\\t-Problem of trying to relax (achievement, perfectionism):  Movement toward tranquility o\\t-Past and future is always an illusion; anxiety is always one of these; It\\'s you creating this reality o\\t-Discovery: Watching for what cognitions, feelings, and behaviors will emerge from tranquility o\\t-Present-moment focus of attention o\\tSensation training: no reaction to reaction; no elaborations or judgments o\\tAttend and process present moment sensations and information; no reaction to it o\\tAsk for examples of present moment absorption: Fireworks, pleasant tasks, hobbies, soapy o\\tdishes  (and homework it: discover little present-moment joys)  5.\\tIn Session PR application.  As in Session Two, sometime in the beginning of this session, and each session from now on, be sure to ask the client to rate his/her present level of anxiety and to relax it away (and re-rate). This request should be repeated at least 3-5 times per session. At first the therapist can use behavioral cues as prompts for anxiety increases (i.e. tapping fingers, facial tension, etc.), and share these cues with the client. At this point the responsibility for recognizing early cues should be shifting to the client, with the client spontaneously reporting these changes in his/her level of anxiety and tension, and followed immediately with a relaxation response.  6.\\tSelf-Statement training and SCD scene selection: Same as Session 5.  7.\\tRelaxation by Recall and Counting  Once the client has learned to achieve deep relaxation through use of the recall procedure, the therapist can in sessions with the client add a counting procedure which the client can use later in home practice sessions. This counting procedure is included at the end of a successful recall session, just prior to termination of that session, but assure that complete relaxation has been  achieved. At this time the therapist should inform the client that s/he is going to institute a procedure designed to allow relaxation to become even deeper. The therapist might say,As you remain very deeply and completely relaxed now, I\\'m going to count from one to ten, and as I count, I\\'d like you to allow all the muscles all through the body to become even more deeply and more completely relaxed on each count. Just focus your attention on all the muscles in the body and notice them as they become even more and more deeply relaxed as I count from one to ten The therapist can then begin counting, interjecting indirect relaxation suggestions somewhat as follows:One, two, noticing the arms and hands becoming more and more relaxed now; three, four, focusing on the muscles of the face and neck as they become even more deeply relaxed now; five, six, allowing the muscles in the chest, shoulders, back, and abdomen to relax even more deeply now; seven, eight, noticing the muscles of the legs and feet becoming more and more completely relaxed; nine, and ten. The therapist should pace this counting to coincide with the client\\'s exhalations. Thus the counting speed would be much slower with client who are more deeply relaxed and breathing more slowly. It is important to coordinate counting with breathing since this will help the client use the same procedures in practicing at home.  Of course, as in all cases in the past, the use of this procedure should be fully outlined to the client before it is first used. S/he should be informed that this is a procedure designed to further focus attention and to allow the relaxation to become even more comfortable. It should not be referred to as adeepening procedure since this has some undesirable connotations involving hypnosis. After the initial use of the counting procedure the client should be encouraged to regularly employ counting at the conclusion of recall practicing and to report on its usefulness at home.  Proceed with the actual training as in Session Two and Session Ten using recall and counting procedures.  8.\\tSCD: Same as Session 5.  9.\\tRRS  10.\\tDiscussion of Experience, Resolution of Problems, Practice Reminder  11.\\tHomework Assignment  1) Twice-a-day Recall with Counting PR and SCD Practice 2) Continuing self-monitoring of anxiety levels, worry and automatic thought identification, and coping self-statement developments, labeling errors, logical analysis, alternative thought generation, decatastrophizing and reappraisals 3) Detection of early cues, DB and AR applications to them; Worry Outcome Monitoring and Stimulus Control applications 4) Client Daily Diary  In addition to the above homework, the client should be encouraged to begin purposely entering anxiety provoking situations and applying his/her newly acquired coping skills and to test belief hypotheses. Decide on specifics as before.  12.\\tClosure  At the end of the session, check again with the client to see if  there are any questions about therapy or any of the procedures so far. Then confirm the date and time of the next appointment.  13.\\tPaperwork  Client In-Session Forms \\tRRS \\tTherapy evaluation form  Client Forms to be taken home (and returned next session). \\tClient Daily Diary \\tRelaxation Practice/Application form (RPA) \\tSCD Practice Form  Therapist in session forms \\tObserver Rating Form \\tSCD Rating Form    \\t \\tSESSION 12  1.\\tAgenda for today  Briefly outline today\\'s session for the C.  2.\\tReview of Week and Homework  A) Collect forms from the last session.

B) Check on frequency of daily PR and SCD practice, conduciveness of environment and circumstances, degree of success experienced by the client in depth of relaxation achieved on his/her own. Review behavioral experiments.  Resolve any problems.  Encourage twice-a-day PR practice at conducive times and circumstances.  3.\\tCognitive Therapy: Treatment of Underlying Beliefs  Although the therapist and client have been increasingly identifying, challenging, and replacing maladaptive underlying beliefs, concentrated efforts in applying these methods to each and every major irrational belief should be implemented and completed during these sessions. Start with a review of DAS pretherapy items and any other irrational beliefs identified and treated in prior sessions. Review how the methods of CT were applied to each and what alternative beliefs were successfully created. Determine whether any other maladaptive beliefs are yet to be fully treated. Next, using client\\'s CDD entries for the past week, work together to identify any deeper beliefs underlying those automatic thoughts. Decatastrophizing andWhat does it mean to you? questions can help in this process. Once you both agree on remaining maladaptive beliefs, go through the earlier-presented cognitive therapy steps and methods to replace those beliefs with multiple, flexible, adaptive beliefs.  Use the following method to help turn the belief statements into specific, challengeable statements: a. Have your clients write a list of their core beliefs, expressed in the form of analyzable assertions.  b. Take one assertion at a time and go through each word in it carefully. Ask the client to make each word as specific and concrete as possible. You may wish to use the following instructions.  Words have different levels of abstraction. To analyze thoughts we should use the lowest level. For instance,this table (pointing to a table near me) is a specific thing. Only one table in the universe isthis table. But we could say more abstractlytable inthe roomthere are severalorfurniture, or even more abstractobject in this room. In each case I am moving from the concrete to the abstract. But notice what happens when we reach the abstractionobject in this room. It\\'s too abstract to mean much. For instance, if I asked,True or false? Is the object in this room brown? you would be unable to answer me becauseobject is  too abstract. To  know the color, you must know whatobject means.  Your thoughts are like that too. If we wanted to know if youneed to be highly successful to be happy, we must know specifically what you mean by several concepts, likeneed, highly, successful and happy. If we don\\'t make these words specific we can\\'t know if the statement is true or false.  c. Develop a series of questions that will help clients pin down their concepts. For example, the therapist can question the beliefI am inferior by asking,What part of you is inferior? Have you always been? How do you know that you will always remain inferior? Inferior compared to whom? When? All the time or just some time? In everything or in just a few ways? What does I am\\' mean? What level of inferior\\' do you mean? Are you at the absolute bottom or just a little bit inferior? What scale have you selected to judge your inferiority? Is the scale valid or do you make it up when you feel bad?  d. After you and your clients have made each word in the sentence as specific as possible, rewrite the sentence incorporating the new definitions.  Example: Emile was a young man who entered therapy because he constantly got angry at himself and others. He always felt frustrated when his plans didn\\'t work out as he thought they should. His unreasonable expectations caused major problems in his marriage, at work, and with his friends.  He was exceptionally bright and quickly found the core belief that created his problems. He believed that his mind could control everything. He thought that he should be able to make himself happy instantaneously, that he could control physical sickness just by exercising his willpower, and that he should be able to make everyone in his environmentincluding his wife, his boss, and his childrenact according to his wishes simply by willing it. When something didn\\'t happen the way he wanted it to, he would get angry with himself for failing to exercise his will correctly. He wanted therapy to make his willpower work more effectively.  Emile\\'s history demonstrates the origins of his belief. He grew up with a father who was a genius, but who, unfortunately, was also erratic emotionally. Emile never felt accepted by his family. In his adolescence, he joined quasi-religious, fundamental cults which offered him acceptance if he acquiesced to their philosophies. Their philosophies centered aroun\\td the idea that the mind was all-powerful. They taught Emile, incorrectly, that anyone could do anything he wanted to in this world if he had enough faith. A person\\'s mind has no limits, they contended. If Emile wanted fame and fortune, it was his if he willed it.  Because he wanted to maintain the closeness with his fellow cult members, Emile accepted this philosophy. But it never worked. He always seemed to bump against limitations. When he asked the cult leaders what was wrong they said he didn\\'t have enough faith. This made him feel guilty, so he tried to get more faith. But he never could. He couldn\\'t seem to get enough faith to make his mind all-powerful.  After going through the preliminary steps of cognitive restructuring therapy, he got to the point of defining the words in  one of his key assertions. He analyzed:The human mind has the willpower to control anything.  At the start of analysis, Emile defined the key words by simply giving synonyms for them. Hence,human mind was replaced withinner being, andpower was replaced withpotency. He was told that good definitions are much more than mere substitutions of one abstraction for another. He was urged to be more specific, and to use words that conveyed concrete images of what he actually meant. The therapist had to offer a couple of suggestions in order to clarify what he was to do, but once Emile got the hang of it, he was able to offer the following suggestions:  mind = the physical organ in the skull, the brain. willpower = a nonphysical energy (spirit) which directs all action. control = to regulate, direct, change, or restrain something. anything = physical things like rocks, weather, trees, etc.; people - their thoughts, emotions, behaviors etc.; self - my bones, muscles, genes, emotions, etc.  The therapist then asked him to create a new sentence which had his more concrete, specific definitions in it. He wrote:  My brain, the organ in my skull, has a spiritual, nonphysical energy which can direct, regulate, or change physical objects, other people, or any aspect of myself.  He was asked to substitute a specific example for controlling a physical thing.  CLIENT: Well, like making it rain. THERAPIST: Put that into the sentence. CLIENT: The spiritual energy in my brain can make it rain, not rain, or change rain into snow. THERAPIST: Do you believe that? CLIENT: That\\'s really stupid. No one can do that.  Other specific examples were discussed, such as having his mind mend a broken leg in a day, change his heredity by turning himself into a 10\\' tall woman, make other people love him, or make rocks turn into snowflakes. After several weeks of considering his thinking, he announced,The power of the mind stuff should win the silly putty of the year award. It\\'s like a child\\'s fairy tale.  Also during these sessions, work with the client to anticipate future stressful events and beliefs that may be relevant and develop preventive beliefs:  In therapy, as in other human endeavors, preventing problems from occurring is preferable to correcting them. A client may have to spend months or years countering a distorted perception created in a single moment of intense emotional arousal. Preventing these distorted perceptions is one of the most important functions of learning to generate alternative adaptive beliefs, and one of the least painful.  Method  1. Review the client\\'s history of irrational thinking and anticipate future false beliefs. 2. Prepare preventive beliefs for each threatening situation the client expects to face or, more generally, for overall client problems. 3. Prepare a master list of situations that most people have to face sometime in their lives, along with irrational thoughts and alternative beliefs. 4. As with other approaches, the client needs to practice until they become second nature.  Examples:  Following are some key irrational thoughts, ones that cause problems for many clients. Changing these attitudes would reduce the chance of becoming emotionally upset in the future.  Problem: I must find my one true love.  Preventive Belief: Many people perpetuate a very ancient myth. A native tale from the Orient speaks of God having blended male and female into a single human soul, when a demon, jealous and resentful of God\\'s creation, magically split the human spirit. Severing the masculine from the feminine, the demon hurled the divided parts into the north wind, scattering them across the earth.  From that time on all men and women were supposed to spend the rest of their lives searching for their missing halves. If they were fortunate they were promised a life of eternal bliss; if not, they would be lonely and incomplete, forever condemned to a fruitless search.  This superstition is very damaging. Some young people pick the first minimally acceptable partner they find just because they feel it is time to get married. A few even set rigid time limits, such asI must be married before I\\'m 30, and marry whoever is standing around when time runs out. Others reject good, decent prospects because they find some flaw, and some abruptly seek divorce after they perceive the faintest blemish, so they can continue their quest for their Romeo or Juliet.  Problem: I am inferior to others.  Preventive Belief: If I compare myself to others, I should use a horizontal rather than a vertical scale. On a vertical scale, people are judged by an overall rating of worth, much as sports writers rate teams; there is a #1 person and a #5,000,000,000 person on this planet. A horizontal scale rejects the notion that one person is in any global sense better than another and recognizes that people have different skills, talents, and abilities. Any overall judgment is like comparing apples and oranges, and therefore false.  The differences among people simply represent the different choices they have made about how to spend their time and energy. Some have chosen to make as much money as they can; others wish to have power. Still others want to acquire a lot of material possessions, while some wish to be brighter than others. If we hold the genetic components constant, people are better at what they have practiced and spend their time doing, worse at what they haven\\'t done. The decisions they have made may prove to be useful or not useful, conducive to happiness or not, but have nothing whatsoever to do with basic worth.  Another way of putting it is that we are all equal, every one of us. We all start out with 100 points: 50 from heredity, 50 from  what we practice. Now some people, like a Mozart or Beethoven, invest 80 of their 100 points in becoming a great composer, but since they only have 20 points left for other things such as economic and social success or being a good parent, they aren\\'t very good at these things. Other people spend their 100 points more evenly, devoting 20 on physical health, 20 to developing their minds, 20 to being a good parent, 20 to making money, and 20 to playing a musical instrument, so they become only moderately good at these things.  Which of these two types is better? Obviously the answer depends on the vantage point of the observers. The person who values music more than economic or parental success, for example, might say the first type is better. But objectively both persons are equal. They simply have invested their energies differently. Despite society\\'s irrational views, the president of a company is not better than the secretary, a husband better than a wife, a professor better than a student, for you can\\'t have one without the other. All component parts must be present for any system to work, be it a corporation, family, or the entire society.  Problem: I should get angry at the way others treat me.  Preventive Belief: My anger is a silly delusion unless four things are true: 1) I did not get what I wanted, 2) I was entitled to get it, 3) It\\'s terrible that I didn\\'t get it, and 4) It\\'s someone else\\'s fault. If these all are true, then my anger is justified and I\\'ll confront the person and try to get what I want. If not, I\\'ll counteract my runaway imagination.  Problem: I have the power to become anything I wish.  Preventive Belief: Throughout history the human race has suffered from the homocentric idea that we have more power over ourselves and our environments than we actually have, when in fact we have little or no control over many of the factors affecting our lives. We have no control, for instance, over our gender, who our parents are, our race, or our nationality, and only a little control over our early environment, our education, and our health. We probably have less than 50% control over encountering a potential mate, becoming rich, or choosing a career. Yet these factors are among the most important influences in our lives. We are creatures on this planet, not creators of it. Thus, we need to spend our time controlling those things we can rather than feeling guilty about those things we can\\'t.  Problem: To be happy I must be very successful.  Preventive Belief: Societies throughout history have touted a wide diversity of goals defining personal success. Some of them have been to be rich, humble, individualistic, conforming, spontaneous, in control, better than others, meek, strong, fertile, frugal, courageous, cautious, thin, beautiful, obedient, cool and calm, strong and aggressive, competitive, cooperative, holy, practical, seductive, pure, unique, innocent, knowledgeable, certain, shrewd, and good. Be rich cultures worship material goods, like houses, cars, oxen,  spears and everything else under the sun. The more materialistic the society, the more likely achievement is to be defined by one\\'s possessions.Be holier societies emphasize the spiritual; the man or woman who has gained the sixth level of Nirvana is twice as good as the person who only manages to creep to the third.Be strong, militaristic societies praise the soldier who is most bellicose, who heaps the most mayhem on the enemy.  Societies perpetuate these illusions to help the culturenot to help the individual. When the culture teaches that a person will be happier when they reach a particular standard of success, what it really means is that the culture will be more viable; these standards are created to make up for what the society lacks to make it politically or economically strong, making personal happiness quite irrelevant. Thus early America, in need of more citizens, honored the woman who held to the traditional values of home and family, but it was doubtful whether the pioneer woman with 10 children was happy with no freedom, no leisure time, no novelty, a minimum of adult interaction and constant health problems. Likewise, young American men emulating the 19th century Horatio Alger type may have found it hard to be happy working 18 hours a day, seven days a week, just to make another million.  Human happiness requires far more than fulfilling some cultural prescription for success. We want safety and a feeling of security; we wish to be cared for and to belong; we seek novelty, change and new stimulation; and perhaps most importantly, we want purpose and meaning. Society\\'s petty success goals, like owning the most expensive car or having the whitest teeth, the biggest biceps, or the silkiest hair, are absurd in comparison. Full human happiness is approached by satisfying all our diverse needs, not simply by surrendering to society\\'s fashionable decrees.  Problem: I must get people to like me to be happy. To do this, I must conform.  Preventive Belief: People, like flowers, must be free to grow in their own direction. Nature has created enormous varieties in the members of each species for a reason; if everyone tried to be like everyone else there would be no variety and the species would adapt less easily to change. Variety is necessary so each organism can make its own contribution to the growth of the species. Fortunately, flowers have automatically developed into what nature planned. Equally unfortunately, people try to become what everybody else wants them to be. If there were only one way a person should be, we would only need one person whom we could then clone into a nation. Our lives have meaning only if we develop our unique individuality. A puppet to society\\'s wishes is of no use to nature.  Comment: Many clients, reluctant to prepare for future problems, wish to work only on the present and then stop counseling the minute they think things have improved. Encourage these clients in particular to do at least some preventive work.  Finally, during these sessions it will be useful for the therapist to engage the client in reverse role play and devil\\'s advocate segments. In the former, the therapist takes on the role of an anxious client with the client rebutting each of the therapist\\'s automatic thoughts and beliefs. In the latter, the therapist tries to dissuade the client from his/her new adaptive thoughts and beliefs, with the client rebutting the therapist\\'s attempts.  4.\\tContinue application training, discussion, questions and problem resolution.  Application training for this and subsequent sessions focuses on developing with the client methods and strategies for the increasingly rapid deployment of various relaxation strategies to increasingly early cue detections. This is accomplished over the sessions by:  a) More detailed discussion of events during the previous week, isolating external and internal early cues that were not previously noticed or responded to with a coping strategy. Therapist should use imaginal reconstruction of such events, slow-motion replay, role-playing, etc. to facilitate such identifications.  b) Detailed discussion of upcoming days and anticipated stress events (mild as well as more severe), identification of likely, early cues, and agreement upon diverse coping methods that will be employed.   c) Training in the varieties of applied relaxation methods (cue-controlled relaxation, differential relaxation, imagery relaxation, diaphragmatic breathing,letting go metaphors) to be flexibly employed in anticipation of, response to, and recovery from the above identified cues, as well as for the development of a generalized, relaxed life style throughout the day.  Follow Bernstein and Borkovec\\'s manual for differential relaxation training, and include walks around the office and outside of the office to demonstrate, practice, and encourage generalization of its use to daily living.  d) Informal self-control desensitization. During all of the above, have the client practice deployment of coping strategies in response to the various cues identified in a) and b) above. With this technique in place, we now have three conditions in therapy under which the client is practicing the rehearsal of coping applications: formal SCD, informal SCD, and applications in-session when therapist or client notice incipient anxiety cues (#5 below). This variety of circumstances of rehearsal will facilitate the likelihood of coping response applications by the client whenever they notice cues in their daily life.  e. Special issues for GAD clients and relaxation training and application:  -Yerkes-Dodson: Relaxation will lead to greater efficiency, productivity, clearer thinking \\t- Fear of less productivity? :  ABAB experiments  - Nonjudgmental Attention and Processing of Present Moment Sensations and Information (i.e., Mindfulness). o\\t-Problem of trying to relax (achievement, perfectionism):  Movement toward tranquility o\\t-Past and future is always an illusion; anxiety is always one of these; It\\'s you creating this reality o\\t-Discovery: Watching for what cognitions, feelings, and behaviors will emerge from tranquility o\\t-Present-moment focus of attention o\\tSensation training: no reaction to reaction; no elaborations or judgments o\\tAttend and process present moment sensations and information; no reaction to it o\\tAsk for examples of present moment absorption: Fireworks, pleasant tasks, hobbies, soapy o\\tdishes  (and homework it: discover little present-moment joys) 5.\\tIn Session PR application.  As in Session Two, sometime in the beginning of this session, and each session from now on, be sure to ask the client to rate his/her present level of anxiety and to relax it away (and re-rate). This request should be repeated at least 3-5 times per session. At first the therapist can use behavioral cues as prompts for anxiety increases (i.e. tapping fingers, facial tension, etc.), and share these cues with the client. At this point the responsibility for recognizing early cues should have been transferred to the client, with the client spontaneously reporting these changes in his/her level of anxiety and tension, and followed immediately with a relaxation response.  6.\\tSelf-Statement training and SCD scene selection: Same as Session 5.  7.\\tRelaxation-by-counting alone  Once the client has successfully integrated the counting procedure into home practice sessions and the therapist is reasonably certain that it has become associated with deep relaxation, a procedure which consists solely of the therapist counting from one to ten and giving indirect suggestions of relaxation can be attempted. This  technique is of primary usefulness as a time-saving device in the office setting, but some clients find it helpful in facing real-life stress situations. (Counting from one to ten has long been a technique for controlling anger: its usefulness is augmented through relaxation training). Again, the therapist should explain to the client what the procedure will involve and allow the client to ask questions prior to initiating this session. The counting procedure can be identical to the one employed in the recall with counting procedure and should be followed by the usual assessment of relaxation. If at the end of the counting procedure the client indicates that some tension remains, the therapist should locate the residual tension and have the client remove it through the recall technique or, in case that should fail, through tension and release. In most cases, any reported residual tension is removable through the now well-established technique of recall.  The client may now be able to attain deep and complete relaxation in a minute or less, depending upon the counting rate, and relaxation is a well-established skill.  Proceed with the actual training using the counting only procedure.  8.\\tSCD: Same as Session 5.  9.\\tRRS  10.\\tDiscussion of Experience, Resolution of Problems, Practice Reminder  11.\\tHomework Assignment  1) Twice-a-day Counting PR and SCD Practice 2) Continuing self-monitoring of anxiety levels, worry and automatic thought identification, coping self-statement developments, labeling errors, logical analysis, alternative thought generation, decatastrophizing and reappraisal, and behavioral experiments. 3) Detection of early cues, DB and AR applications to them; Worry Outcome Monitoring and Stimulus Control applications 4) Client Daily Diary  In addition to the above homework, the client should be encouraged to begin purposely entering anxiety provoking situations and applying his/her newly acquired coping skills and to test belief hypotheses. Decide on specifics, as before.  12.\\tClosure  At the end of the session, check again with the client to see if there are any questions about therapy or any of the procedures so far.   13.\\tPaperwork  Client In-Session Forms \\tRRS \\tTherapy evaluation form  Client Forms to be taken home (and returned next session). \\t Client Daily Diary \\t Relaxation Practice/Application form (RP&A) \\t SCD Practice Form  Therapist in session forms \\tObserver Rating Form \\tSCD Rating Form    \\t \\tSESSIONS 13 AND 14  1.\\tAgenda for today  Briefly outline today\\'s session for the C.  2.\\tReview of Week and Homework  A) Collect forms from the last session.

B) Check on frequency of daily PR and SCD practice, conduciveness of environment and circumstances, degree of success experienced by the client in depth of relaxation achieved on his/her own. Review efforts to identify, challenge, and replace underlying beliefs.  Resolve any problems. Encourage twice-a-day PR practice at conducive times and circumstances.  3.\\tCognitive Therapy: Continue Treatment of Underlying Beliefs  4.\\tContinue application training, discussion, questions and problem resolution.  Application training for this and subsequent sessions focuses on developing with the client methods and strategies for the increasingly rapid deployment of various relaxation strategies to increasingly early cue detections.

It is important to discuss with the client how s/he is feeling about reaching the end of therapy, and how s/he feels about continuing to use applied relaxation, SCD, and CT on his/her own.  And it is also important to discuss maintenance strategies:   1. Old habits will try to occur sometimes 2. SCD of future anxiety episodes and worry about relapse 3. Self-administered SCD 4. Review of evidence of success 5. Written handout of individually tailored interventions  Otherwise, these sessions will follow a similar format and therapeutic style as the previous 14 sessions.    PR APPENDIX  GUIDELINES FOR DETERMINING A TRAINING TIMETABLE  There is really only one rule to follow in determining the rate at which the therapist trains the client in the more efficient relaxation procedures outlined in this chapter: never introduce a new procedure until the client has mastered the previous one. This rule is deceptively simple, however, since it is often difficult to determine just when the client is ready to move on to the next step in training. Before suggesting how the therapist might obtain this information, not that we do have a time table for the PR treatment trial. This timetable is conservative in that most clients proceed more rapidly than is indicated in the schedule presented below. However, it is ultimately less disruptive to move too slowly than topush a client through the procedures. Any overlearning which may occur it the therapist follows the timetable presented here will probably be beneficial to the client in the long run.  We suggest that the initial procedure (utilizing sixteen muscle groups) be employed for the first PR session.  If at the next session the client is achieving satisfactory relaxation without difficulty (according to the rules which we will outline below), the 4-group procedure should be introduced. The new procedure should be practiced by the client during the next week and employed again at the next several sessions in order to insure that it is being used correctly and to the client\\'s satisfaction.  The recall procedure would be introduced at the tenth session, and repeated at the eleventh with the counting procedure added. Counting alone may then be employed at session twelve and at both fading session.  Again, we would like to emphasize that this schedule, which suggests that the client start learning the counting procedure by the twelfth session, is only a theoretical outline. The important concern is that of client skill and satisfaction at each step in the training program. Resolution of these issues is the main prerequisite for proceeding to the next step.  Many clients will want to please the therapist and attempt to hide difficulties that have occurred in practice sessions; therefore, the therapist must be constantly alert for indications of troubles which are not reported by the client. Perhaps the main indirect signal of the presence of problems is the client\\'s failure to fulfill practice obligations. The client should, and indeed must, practice the assigned procedures as directed; if this is not  occurring, it may mean that the relaxation experience is insufficiently reinforcing to maintain regular efforts at improving it. Deviations from thetwo-a-day routine (with the exception of minor inconsistencies caused by unexpected events) normally warrant delay in moving through the training until the client is practicing on a regular basis. It is inadvisable to mention this to the client, lest s/he give false reports in impatience to make progress. Rather, gently but firm insistence on consistent practice should suffice.  Related to practice regularity is the client\\'s continuity of progress. Clients who report encountering no major difficulties in relaxation but fail to show progress in terms of increased speed, efficiency, and degree of comfort may be withholding information.    Beginning Questions and Answers The goals of this chapter are to understand ,; the general outline of the program ~\\'i the symptoms of depression \\'1 the types of depression how the primacy and recency effects influence your experiences the BEAST metaphor for depression A General Overview of Depression Depression is a familiar emotion to most people. You may be familiar with depression because a loved one has suffered from it. You may know about depression because of what you have read in newspapers and magazines. You may see programs and information about it on TV. You may have called it lithe blues,\" \"feeling down,\" being \"out of sorts,\" or just feeling \"negative,\" but depression is no stranger to most of us. The effects of depression may include emotional symptoms such as sadness and physical symptoms such as loss of appetite; people who are depressed may simply want to be left alone, or they may hide from the world. For some people, depression brings feelings of hopelessness and a sense that things will never get better. In severe situations, some individuals plan or even attempt suicide. Depression is a broad term used to describe a variety of experiences, symptoms, and emotions. Associated with depression are behaviors such as avoidance of pleasurable activities and lack of motivation. Sometimes even everyday things are difficult, such as going to work, paying bills, caring for personal 1 II hygiene, getting out of bed, or leaving the house. Sleep patterns may be disrupted. For instance, a depressed person may wake up too early, have difficulty falling asleep, or wake up in the middle of the night. Sex may become uninteresting and may be avoided. Appetite may decrease, leading to unwanted weight loss, or appetite may increase, leading to unwanted weight gain. Depression appears without invitation. Sometimes depression is a reaction to some life experience, such as the death of a loved one. This kind of reactive depression is to be expected and is usually short-lived. Other times, depression mav come for no clear reason and stay far longer than anticipated. Some people believe they are depressed all the time. For these people, feelings of happiness are an illusion, and reality is seen through a dark filter of depressive misery. Perhaps you are reading this client workbook because you or someone you know may be experiencing depression. If this is the case, these descriptions are probably all too familiar. You may have dealt with depression in the past. The good news is that working with your therapist and using this workbook as part of therapy will put you on the road to recovering from depression. You will begin taking charge of your life by learning specific techniques for coping with depression if it returns. Depression can be limited in its effects, shortened in its duration, and defeated. What Makes This Program Different? What makes this program for treating depression different from other programs or previous therapy? You may be saying to yourself, \"I\\'ve tried to deal with depression before, and it didn\\'t work\" or \"I\\'ve been in therapy, so why will this be different?\" This program is based on a psychotherapy called cognitive therapy (CT). We will explain exactly what that means as we go through the program. An important fact that you should know about cognitive therapy is that it is one of the most effective therapies available for the treatment of depression (Dobson, 1989). In fact, this therapy can be at least as effective as antidepressant medication in treating depression. If medication is prescribed, cognitive therapy is a useful supplement to the medicine to decrease the likelihood that depression will recur. How Does the Program Work? This program is based on the idea that when you are depressed, your own internal processes are at work. The good part of this is that you can also use those internal processes to feel better. Our first goal is to help you develop skills to identify the specific pieces that go into depression. Very often, this involves understanding the thinking patterns II 2 associated with depressed mood. Understanding the connection between your negative thinking, low moods, and withdrawn behavior is essential. Next, we will begin to work on making changes in your life. This problem-focused approach asks you to track how you think and what you do between sessions and then work on strategies for change. The pace is set using the teamwork relationship between you and your therapist. Everyone is different, and we recommend that you work with your therapist or counselor to tailor different techniques to your own particular needs. Later on, going back to some of the sections in which you may have experienced some difficulty may be useful. At the end of each chapter is a review section designed to help you gauge your understanding of the ideas presented and monitor your progress. If you find that the questions are difficult, go back to the relevant sections in the chapter and reread them until you can answer the questions at the end. Do not hesitate to talk with your therapist about the review questions and about sections of the chapter that are unclear. Throughout this workbook, we will be asking you to think about things differently than you may be used to. We will ask you to write thoughts down, try new activities, and talk about things. Through this process, you will begin to take control of your life by taking small, easily managed steps. You don\\'t have to worry about doing everything at once. Individuals who have depression frequently report, \"My family thinks that I\\'m not really depressed enough for therapy. They think that I just need to perk up (get a job, get a hobby, get out more, get a pet). What do I do?\" For now, remember that you are the one who is experiencing a depressive change in mood. Only you can really know the severity of your depression and whether you want to change this situation for yourself. This program will help you identify your depression and assess your motivation to change it. What Is Depression7 Depression is sometimes called the common cold of emotional problems because most people have experienced it at some time in their lives. You are not alone in your depression. It is estimated that 17.6 million Americans suffer from depression each year (National Institutes of Health, 1997). Depression can be far more disabling than medical illnesses such as chronic lung disease, arthritis, and diabetes. Although these facts and statistics are startling, the subjective experience of depression can be overwhelming. The important fact for you now is that the problem of depression has been identified, and there is something you can do about it. Like the common cold, in the past few years newer and more effective treatments to relieve depression have been developed. These treatments can teach you 3 to improve your thinking so that you may live a more fulfilling life. This program was developed to help you cope more effectively with the problem of depression and other mood disorders. This client workbook was designed to enhance your efforts to improve your life by first gaining control over your mood. As we mentioned before, the term depression describes a number of problems. We are going to work on your specific problems by starting with general complaints. Recognizing general complaints will help you and your therapist identify specific areas in which your thoughts have become depressive. We are going to locate reasons for your depression. You may wonder if there is a difference between being in a bad mood and being depressed. Everyone gets in a bad mood now and then. Many times, it is nothing to worry about. However, if your bad mood persists for days or weeks, you become depressed frequently, or your low points of depression are extreme, you may need to see a professional therapist to get a more thorough evaluation. Following are examples of individuals who found themselves struggling with depression. Do any of these descriptions sound familiar? Case Examples James James, a supervisor at a car assembly plant, came to therapy after his employer downsized and he was laid off. He found himself having trouble reading, talking to his wife, and just getting up in the morning. He no longer enjoyed activities that he used to look forward to, like playing cards, watching TV; and bowling. He began to avoid contact with friends and ignore his family. When he and his therapist took notice of his thinking (or cognitions), they discovered that when he felt bad he would first think about how terrible it was to be out of work. The negative thinking then generalized to thoughts such as \"I never really was competent to work in a responsible job\" and \"I am a failure at everything I have ever tried. 1/ Sadness turned into grief, and grief turned into depression. James and his therapist began to work on identifying and disputing the negative thinking he had about himself and his life. While he was in his worst mood, James ignored the advantages of his layoff. He had left his job with severance pay of 1 year\\'s full salary and benefits while he looked for another job. Some may say he had no reason to feel bad. However, James had a strong belief that it was shameful to be asked to leave a position that he had held for 15 years. Challenging such a belief and the thoughts associated with it was the starting point that led James to recover from depression. He rediscovered the people he loved and began to pursue a change in career.4 Betty Betty was 32 years old and recently divorced. She had a 4-year-old child and had to balance work and day care. She started to feel that nothing was going to go right for her ever again. She found herself going through the same daily routine. By the time weekends came, she was too tired and unmotivated to maintain her household. Watching television had been her favorite way to relax, and she found that she no longer derived enjoyment from that. She withdrew from friends and sensed that there was no pleasure for her in anything. The less she did, the worse she felt. She had trouble getting to sleep and frequently woke up hours before her alarm dock was set to go off. Her eating patterns became irregular, and her diet consisted mostly of junk food, which led to a weight gain. Her mood was affecting her child. She started to wish she was dead and finally sought treatment at her parents\\' urging. Ellen For Ellen, the situation was completely different. She had no divorce, no job loss, and no hard times. She was married to a warm, supportive husband. Her children were both in college and doing well. Her parents were retired and healthy. She enjoyed good relationships with her brother and two sisters. She worked at a parttime job she liked with people she liked. She lived in a nice house in a nice neighborhood and had a very comfortable life. You might ask, \"What does she have to be depressed about?\" The answer is apparently nothing. But depression does not limit itself to people with obvious problems. Ellen began having trouble getting up in the mommg: she lost interest in spending time with her husband and spoke to her children only briefly by phone. The job she used to enjoy she no longer wanted. Ellen was depressed: She somehow attributed her depression to being a bad person. The reasonable punishment for her imagined badness was the depression. If these examples sound familiar to you, you may be struggling with depression. Read on for more information. Identifying Symptoms Following is a chart listing the symptoms of depression. Go through the chart three times. The first time, just check the ones that apply to you. The second time, rate how severe each problem has been in your most recent depression on a scale from 1 to 10. Finally, go through the list a third time and evaluate how frequently the symptom occurs over a period of time (e.g., 1 week). 5 Symptom Does Symptom Currently Apply To You? \"~\" if \"Yes\" Severity (1-10)* How Often Does This Symptom Occur? 1. Low mood almost every day or part of every day for at least 2 weeks 2. Lack of interest in activities that were once pleasurable 3. Weight loss or gain (not from dieting) of S% of body weight 4. Difficulty falling or staying asleep or early awakening nearly every night S. Sluggishness or physical tension almost every day 6. Fatigue or low energy almost every day 7. Low self-esteem and a sense of worthlessness or guilt 8. Chronic difficultymaking decisions, thinking clearly, and/or keeping focused 9. Repetitive thoughts of death and suicide and/or plans to commit suicide 10. Symptoms seem worse in the morning, including often waking up too early *1 = almost nonexistent in my life 5 = applies to me about half of the time 10 = very relevant to my condition II 6 Naming the Prob~em There are many types of depression. Each is different from the others in subtle ways. The different names that are used often reflect how severe or long-standing the problem is. Some of the familiar \"flavors\" of depression follow. Major Depressive Disorder Major depressive disorder is the most common of the mood disorders. It is a serious condition that interferes with functioning and requires treatment. This depression may be experienced as a single episode or as a series of episodes. For a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, five or more of the following symptoms must be present during the same 2-week period: depressed mood or loss of interest and significant weight loss or gain or change in appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, motor agitation or slowness, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, decreased ability to concentrate or make decisions, recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. Dysthymic Disorder Dysthymic disorder is sometimes called \"watered-down depression.\" A person who has dysthymic disorder experiences depressed mood for most of the day, for more days than not, for a period of at least 2 years. In addition, two or more of the following symptoms are also present: poor appetite or overeating, insomnia or hypersomnia, low energy or fatigue, low self-esteem, poor concentration or indecisiveness, feelings of hopelessness. Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood The depression that occurs with adjustment disorder is usually directly related to a particular life problem and a person\\'s difficulty in adjusting to it. The depressed mood usually occurs within 3 months of the onset of the stressor. The symptoms cause either marked distress or significant impairment. Mood Disorder Due to a General Medic~1 Condition, with Depressive Features As the name implies, this type of depression is due to a physical illness. The possibility of such a cause emphasizes the need for a medical evaluation to eliminate (or treat) the medical condition as a factor in the depression. Substance,;lnduced Mood Disorder, with Depressive FeatMres Use of alcohol or other drugs (especially \"downers\") can cause depressive-like symptoms. Withdrawal from cocaine, amphetamines, alcohol, or barbiturates can also contribute to depression. 7 ~ Bipolar Disorder One of the more serious mood disorders involving depression is bipolar disorder, which is often better known by its former name, manic depression. Bipolar disorder includes mood changes that occur in cycles with \"highs\" or manic periods that give way to periods of intense depression. It usually includes some period when mood becomes balanced between the periods of depression and mania. In a manic phase, people feel exhilarated to the degree that they may become grandiose and have unrealistic beliefs about their abilities. If you are feeling depressed right now, you might say to yourself that it would be wonderful to feel so great. Actually, with this \"too good\" feeling, agitation and irritability are very common. These symptoms often lead to high-risk behaviors such as going over budget with credit cards, making dangerous and speculative investments, engaging in sexual indiscretions, and other activities that could lead to painful consequences. For some individuals, these \"high\" symptoms may become so severe that hospitalization is necessary because of their lack of sleep or inability to care responsibly for themselves and their families. other Mood Problems One form of low mood is referred to as realistic depression, grief, or bereavement. If you have suffered serious losses or dramatic changes in your life recently and are feeling down as a result, you may be experiencing a natural reaction that many people go through. As natural aspects of human experience, such periods of sadness are not viewed as a form of depression unless they are unusually severe, are present for an extended period, or cause significant distress and impairment. Regardless of the exact title of your depression, the essential similarity of the different types of depression allows us to deal with them all in a similar fashion. Any form of depression may have an impact on work and relationships, some more severely than others and some for briefer times than others. All depression involves a negative view of the world (the belief that the world is a horrible place), a negative view of self (low self-esteem), and a negative view of the future (the belief that things will never improve). We will talk about this in greater detail in the next chapter. Telling Thoughts of Self..Harm At some point, all of us think about getting away from it all. For some, that means getting into bed and pulling the covers up. For others, it may take the form of a vacation to a favorite place. For others, it might mean a visit to a church, synagogue, or other place of refuge. For some, however, getting away from it all means the ultimate escape through death. If at any time you have thoughts of harming yourself or someone else, you must immediately contact your physician, therapist, or local crisis center. Suicidal wishes are a common and potentially lethal problem for many people who are depressed and for their families. ,. 8 This program is designed to help you find appropriate and helpful alternatives to such drastic action. Some people feel that talking about suicidal thoughts may make the idea seem more acceptable. Because they feel embarrassed about having them, others keep them a secret. Our experience is that talking openly about such thoughts can help you view them more objectively and may provide you with some immediate relief. Remember that your relationship with your therapist is based on trust. That trust and the investment of your time and effort are what will help you feel better. Talk with your therapist about any thoughts or impulses you may be having or may have had regarding suicide or harming yourself. Depression When It Is Most Danger@us: Suicidal Thoughts Depression is a dangerous creature when it tries to attack your sense of hope. Loss of hope develops when your reasons for being alive are threatened by negative thoughts about the future. For some individuals, loss of hope about the future is so severe that they consider killing themselves to solve or escape problems. Suicideis sometimes described as a permanent solution to temporary problems. When not confronted directly, thoughts about suicide may appear to provide a way out of emotional pain, physical pain, unrelenting pressure, or embarrassing situations. This is a false impression and a symptom of depression that must be challenged. The following questions are designed to measure how much you suffer from loss of hope. For each question, score 1 for not at all, 2 for rarely, 3 for sometimes, 4 for often, and 5 for all the time. If you answer 2, 3, 4, or 5 to any of them, contact your therapist and discuss the feelings and thoughts you are having. Sometimes you may need another person to help you challenge loss of hope when you have lost the strength to do so yourself. 1. I have thoughts of killing myself. _ 2. I have plans to kill myself. _ 3. I feel hopeless about the future. _ 4. I think no one would miss me if I died. _ 5. I think that if I kill myself, others will see how much I hurt. _ 6. I think there is no reason for me to live. -7. I am a burden to others. _ 8. It seems that things will never get any better. _ 9. It seems that any hope that I once had is now gone. _ 10. Nothing matters anymore. _ Add up your total score. If your score is 20 or higher or if you responded 3 or more to question 2, talk to a mental health professional right away. Stories of Hope The actor Christopher Reeve played the role of Superman in the movies. He had (and has) every feature of a courageous hero. In the movies, the man of steel was practically invulnerable to the forces that could injure or defeat mere mortals. Only the rare substance kryptonite could weaken him. In real life, Reeve fell from a horse and was paralyzed as a result of the accident that broke his neck. He has no movement below his neck and is not able to breathe without mechanical help. He is no longer able to get around or take care of himself without assistance. However, a year after his accident, he was interviewed about his recovery. Many people who know about Reeve\\'s plight questioned themselves about whether they would have wanted to live after such tragic loss of physical functions. How could he go on? Reeve\\'s statements in that interview indicated that he had once had the kind of hopeless thinking you may be experiencing. However, he began making decisions that led him to choose life over death. His reasons for choosing life were based on his situation and values, but more important is the fact that he confronted this decision in the face of circumstances that would have caused many people to lose hope. Pete Seeger, the folk singer who writes about struggle} change} and hope, including songs such as IIWe Shall Overcome\\' and IITum, Turn, Turn,\" often tells the following story at his concerts (Seeger & Blood, 1997). A man is walking in the forest when a tiger jumps out from behind the bushes and begins to chase him. The man runs as fast as he can, but the hungry tiger is gaining ground. If he is caught} the beast will certainly kill and eat him. Ahead of him is a cliff. If he stops running, he will die. If he jumps, who knows? He decides to jump. When he does, he catches a branch on the way down. The branch starts to crack. On the side of the cliff} he sees a ripe strawberry and takes a bite. The man thinks to himself} 11This is the sweetest thing I have ever had in my life.\" The essential aspect about adversity is that you do not know what will come next. Hope is possible, even in the most serious of circumstances. Finding reasons to stay alive is a challenge that anyone who deals with depression may face. The effort to find reasons to live represents the direction of this workbook and your therapy. You can find satisfying ways to convert the strongest feelings of outrage and hurt into meaningful} life-enhancing activities and interactions. Reeve provides a dramatic example. By actively confronting loss of hope and enhancing the skills you will develop through therapy, it is possible to overcome many adversities, even in severe circumstances. What Influences Your Experiences: The Primacy and Recency Effects If you are asked how you feel} chances are you would answer according to how you are feeling right now (the recency effect). When you are feeling down or depressed, you may feel that you have always felt this way and have II 10 troubJe remembering better times. Many times depression seems to dictate that any \"better\" moods are illusions and that the real world is limited to the darkness of depression. Depression also often goes along with feeling overwhelmed. Research on mood problems indicates that global selfassessment is usually influenced by two types of effects on experience: primacy and recency. Primacy effect refers to the observation that events from early in your memory influence how you experience the present. For example, if a schoolteacher mistreated you early in your education, you are likely to feel uncomfortable around other teachers, even in situations in which you have not been mistreated. This expectation may lead to avoidance of teachers or avoidance of school altogether. This avoidance can be self-defeating by sustaining the expectation that you will be mistreated. Recency effect refers to the observation that the most recent events in your life have a particularly strong effect on your general attitude toward yourself, your situation, and the future. The following example illustrates the recency effect. You are driving to meet someone, and on the way another driver changes lanes and crashes into your front fender. After you finish the accident report with the police, you go on to meet your friend. Do you think the recency of your traffic accident would affect how you feel when you finally get to see your friend? Most people are apt to be in a less than pleasant mood or at least distracted. The emotions that you experience in reaction to your most recent experiences may produce similar emotions when you react to events that closely follow. How Can I Fight What I Can\\'t See? The BEAST Metaphor Your therapy will treat your depression more effectively if you know and understand the enemy. We use a metaphor to describe depression as the BEAST. The BEAST is a metaphor in that it suggests a similarity between depression and a beast. Using the BEAST metaphor, you can think of depression as the process that results in sapped energy, diminished pleasure, and reduced motivation. The BEAST metaphor may help you see problems of depression as separate from who you are as a person. You can then use this metaphor to see yourself as the person who can tame the BEAST of depression. Understanding the BEAST of DepressBon Depressionisnotonesingleproblem. Rather, itisa combinationofmanydifferent aspects and issues. In addition to using BEAST as a metaphor, you can also use the word as an acronym to remember the various aspects of depression. An acronym is 11 II a word made up of the first letter of each word in a phrase or list. The BEAST represents the following components of depression: Body (biology and biochemistry) Emotion (how you feel) ~l~ Action (what you do) Situation (your immediate life experiences) Thoughts (how and what you think) Each of these components is important in understanding depression and how it is maintained. By looking at each of these parts, you can start to shrink the bigger-than-life-size BEAST of depression down to a size you can manage. There is much more to say about the BEAST, so read on. Now that you understand how the BEAST represents the different aspects of depression, let\\'s start working on overcoming it. Recognize that there is more to recovering from depression than simply deciding to do it. There are forces pulling in many directions. One force says, \"Get going\"; another says, \"Sit and wait. It will go away!\\' Yet another force says, \"Nothing that you do will change anything.\" Self-Enhancement Assignments To help you combat forces that may conflict with your goals for therapy, we have included self-enhancement assignments (assignments that you do on your own) II 12 in each section. They are designed to enhance what you learn in therapy and to contribute to your improvement. The new skills that you learn through this program and with your therapist are like any other skills: Your performance improves with practice. The self-enhancement assignments provide that practice. What If I\\'m Too Depressed to Do This? One of the thinking errors people with depression make is relying on their mistaken belief that nothing will work out for them. Then, on the basis of this idea, they give up before they make an effort. If you are like this, you are probably experiencing a symptom of depression. To challenge the symptom, consider the scientific concept that theories are not valid until they are tested. When you do not work on self-enhancement assignments, you are relying on an untested theory. Try the exercises before you assume that they will not work for you. Will Medication Help Me? For many people, medication is an important part of the overall psychotherapy plan. If you are severely depressed, medication may be an essential part of helping you reach a level where you can use other forms of therapy. For some individuals, such as those with bipolar disorder, medication is essential. However, in the treatment of more typical unipolar depression, medication mayor may not be indicated. Whether to begin or continue to take medication for your mood is ultimately your decision. Consultation, agreement, and communication with your psychiatrist or family physician are essential for your continued health. Do not begin, alter, or stop medication without first consulting your physician. Keeping Track: How Can I Tell If I Am Improving? To ensure that you know when change has taken place, you must first know how you are doing before you begin the program. You will be learning throughout the program how to step back and reflect on how you are doing. This part of the evaluation process lets you know where you were when you started and how far you have come. An important part of the program addresses how you can keep track of your daily life (Chapter 5) so that you have a better idea of just what you are (or are not) doing with your day. In another section of the program (Chapter 6), you will learn to record situations in which you experience a particularly low mood. All of these parts of the program are intended to help you learn when, how, and sometimes why you get depressed. They will also help you understand how you react to these situations and circumstances. Once you have a clear picture of these factors, you will begin to see how this program and your own effort can change your mood. Learning how to keep track of these different aspects of your life can 13 II help to improve your mood, especially when you look back and see the progress you have made. Do you know why you are depressed? Many people who have mood disorders seem to look for a single explanation to get at the root of their problem. Mood disorders can cause much distress, so it is not surprising that you would want to find a quick cure. But where do you look? Some say that the only way to understand and deal with depression is first to look back on the past. Bygoing through this search, you may come up with some insight that may lift your depression. This program does not take this approach. Instead, you will learn how to change your negative thinking now to relieve your current depression and prevent future depression. As mentioned before, a basic principle of this program is that you are going to be focusing more on looking ahead to where you are going, rather than back at where you have been. The second principle is that there are specific reasons for your low mood that you can identify and change. It is important to understand, however, that your problems probably will not be solved by a sudden burst of insight that will immediately change your mood. Identifying specific problems is a gradual process of small insights that contribute to understanding your depression. How long Win This Program Taite? Given how bad you may feel, it is understandable that you may want to be over your depression as quickly as possible. In many ways, our culture focuses on quick fixes. If life was like a TV show, a life-threatening problem or breakdown would be fixed in one episode. The crew of a ship (starship, airship, ocean-going ship) is in danger, and in 60 minutes they are saved (along with the world or universe as well, sometimes). In reality, these situations and the related thinking are unrealistic and can set you up for disappointment. There are ways to repair some aspects of your life rather quickly. More realistically, weeks or months are needed to manage the BEAST of depression and start to take control. Keep in mind that this period is usually less time than it takes for depression to develop. An important question that you must think about is this: Are you ready to take charge of and deal with your depression? It takes energy to stay depressed, and it takes effort to divert the energy that keeps you from changing. Each time you decide to try the assignments in this book, you make a courageous decision to move away from depression toward more effective ways of thinking, feeling, and acting. It also takes effort to avoid doing the things that may get you into a dark emotional hole. The choices are yours to make, with the help of your therapist and this program. It is your courage to change at a pace that fits you II 14 that will make a difference. Like many things in life, you won\\'t get the benefit unless you get involved, and we cannot overemphasize the importance of doing the self-enhancement assignments. The speed with which you and your therapist work through this workbook and your treatment is based on many factors, including the severity of your depression, your motivation to change, the time you can put into changing, the distractions and interferences you experience, and, most important, how willing you are to stick to the program. Although some people may benefit from daily or weekly work, others may benefit more by a slower pace. You will decide how quickly to move along. You can discuss this with your therapist and gauge yourself by a standard that fits you. This program and the information you acquire are for lifelong improvement. It is designed to give you a chance to understand your thinking and challenge the old beliefs that have kept you down in the past. Take as much time as you need. Some of you may be excited by the prospect of taking control and beating the BEAST of your depression at its own game. Others of you may be discouraged and saying, \"I\\'ve been here before. I\\'ve tried other programs. I\\'ve tried therapy. I have a dozen books on my shelf at home that have made the same promises.\" Do not let a negative view prevent your recovery from depression. Take charge! How Do I Get Started? To begin our work, we will return to the BEAST metaphor. B = Body E = Emotion A Action S Situation T Thoughts The first steps involve tracking or identifying the BEAST. What is the BEAST? What are the effects of Body, Emotion, Action, Situation, and Thoughts when you are feeling low? Each of these elements contributes to the overall picture of depression. Instead of asking these questions in the dark, the workbook gives you a means to hunt these interrelated problems with minimum effort and maximum results as you start the program. As you identify and control each part, the BEAST becomes more controllable and has less effect on your life. For each of the following statements, identify which particular problems you experience. Each statement begins with the letter that links it to the BEAST acronym. After you have completed this exercise, look at which aspects of depression are the most problematic for you. 15 GJI Yes No Bl. I feel physically ill, but my doctor has trouble identifying medical problems. B2. I am generally fatigued. B3. I experience muscle aches and pains. B4. I tend to get headaches. B5.

Motivation for Change A good way to begin this program is to assess your level of motivation. To do this, answer the following questions about your motivation for change. I want to enjoy life more. My sleep patterns are not right. I think about killing myself, but I do not really want to. I would like to have good relationships. True 0 0 0 0 False 0 0 0 0 17 True False I want to concentrate better. 0 0 I want to be less irritable. 0 0 I want more energy. 0 0 I would like to control my weight. 0 0 I want to like myself. 0 0 I would like to enjoy sex again. 0 0 If you answered true to at least seven of these questions, you have the motivation necessary to change. If you answered true to fewer than seven of these questions, you might want to discuss your motivation for change with your therapist. In beginning this program, it is important that you are motivated to change. Remember, you are the only one who can choose to take control and overcome your depression. The following chapters are designed to help you recognize the BEAST, take action to tame the BEAST, and build on your progress toward change. It is important to work with your therapist to tailor different methods to meet your needs. You will be able to review and master areas where you may have experienced some difficulty.

Beck. It is one of several cognitive-behavioral models of therapy (Beck, 1983; Beck & Freeman, 1990; Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979) that include the pioneering works of Albert Ellis (Ellis, 1973; Ellis & Harper, 1975), Arnold Lazarus (1976), and Donald Meichenbaum (Meichenbaum & Turk, 1987). The major focus of CT is to help you examine how you understand the world (your cognitions) and to help you experiment with new ways of responding (your behaviors). Understanding the unique way you perceive yourself, your life experiences, and your prospects for the future can help you alter depression and behave more adaptively. The cognitive model of depression in this program is based on the tendency of people who are depressed to perceive themselves, their situation, and their future in a negative way. If you are like most individuals who are depressed, you tend to view yourself as inadequate, incapable, and unlovable. You might also believe that others reject you and criticize you. You may view your future as bleak and hopeless. Given this belief system, your apathy and lowered 21 III energy levels are not surprising. If you believe your efforts will be fruitless, it would make sense to conserve your energy and to spare work that will result in failure. This pattern of thinking has been observed among adults, adolescents, and children who are experiencing depressioi. In a research study that demonstrated how mood can affect how we see things, people were shown two pictures at once, one in either eye (Gilson, 1984). The pictures shown to one eye had negative themes and the picture flashed to the other eye had neutral or positive themes. Since the images were flashed simultaneously at a very fast speed, people usually were only able to report some of the information with which they were presented. Depressed people tended to report the most negative information and people who were not depressed tended to describe a balance of negative, neutral, and positive aspects of what they saw. It appeared that people who were depressed were accurate, but selectively negative in how they processed the information they were given. In a similar study, participants were presented with negative and neutral words. People who were depressed tended to recognize a higher proportion of negative words than those who were not depressed (Powell & Hemsley, 1984). You have only so much energy to use to focus on a world full of positive, negative, and neutral options. Emotional bias suggests that your priorities for the options you decide to select or reject might be based on how you feel (Clark, Fairburn, & Gelder, 1997). These results are important for understanding what may help people who are depressed. (l\\'J 22 Elements of Depression Cognitive therapy helps to identify emotions and behavior patterns, as well as the thoughts and beliefs that maintain them. Once these thoughts and patterns are identified, it is possible to actively change your behavior, adapt more functionally to your world, and feel better. Within the cognitive model, affect, behavior, physiological processes, environmental events, and thoughts are seen as interacting components that influence one another. There are five basic principles of the cognitive therapy model. 1. The way you interpret experiences, events, and situations directly influences how you subsequently feel and behave and vice versa. Cognitions (thoughts) are related to emotions and behavior. 2. This interpretation process is ongoing. It permits you to understand life events. It is goal directed and should help you function more effectively. 3. Belief systems guide behavior and influence perceptions. You may become sensitive to specific external and internal events that you experience as stressful. You may also selectively pay attention to and recall information that is consistent with your belief system. Likewise, you may selectively \"overlook\" information that is inconsistent with your beliefs. 4. This process of selection may impair cognitive processing. The impairment represents an attempted coping response that does not work. A system is established in which these less effective coping behaviors actually maintain negative events. In fact, this process may strengthen the maladaptive belief system. 5. The good news is that you actively organize your experiences, and you can therefore learn to use these skills to more adaptive coping. Cognitive therapy and this program give you the tools to use your experience more adaptively. You are always the important active agent. According to cognitive theories, three major factors are involved in developing and maintaining depression: (1) the cognitive triad, (2) cognitive distortions, and (3) schemas and assumptions. The Cognitive Triad As discussed previously, individuals who are depressed tend to view themselves, their current experiences, and their future in an unrealistically negative manner, described by cognitive theorist Aaron Beck (1976) as the cognitive triad. 23 iii The first component of the triad is a negative view of the self. Individuals who are depressed tend to view themselves as inferior. Their thoughts are distortions by which they attribute their shortcomings to enduring, irreparable defects in personal capacities. As such, they perceive themselves as lacking the abilities necessary for gaining a sense of satisfaction. A negative self-view with accompanying self-accusations and reproaches was initially described by Sigmund Freud as an important characteristic of what we now know as depression (1917/1991). Second, individuals who are depressed typically adopt a negative view of the world and their relationships with others. They view life as an unending struggle against recurring obstacles and see other people as critical, unsupportive, or rejecting. Because they perceive themselves as inept and their difficulties as insurmountable, they feel unworthy of others\\' support and anticipate rejection. Theirs is a bleak world with few rewards. These beliefs, however, are not entirely unfounded. The behavior of individuals who are depressed eventually leads to rejection and loss of others\\' support. The final component of the cognitive triad centers on a pessimistic outlook for the future. Individuals who are depressed anticipate continued hardships and see little chance of success. Although there is some controversy about the presence of this component among children who are depressed, it has been observed among adolescents and adults who are depressed. Within this perspective, suicidal ideas often reflect a desire to escape what the individual perceives as an unbearable situation. 24 The relationship between depressive thoughts and the severity of depressive symptoms is typically strong. A research study of 81 clients in psychotherapy showed that those who were depressed had distorted thinking and misinterpreted events in terms of personal failure or rejection. Clients who were depressed also exaggerated the significance of events that seemed to reflect badly on them and maintained negative predictions that were not supported by facts. Studies documenting negative beliefs about self, world, and future among individuals who are depressed have generally supported the cognitive model (Beck, 1976). Cognitive Distortions An individual\\'s thoughts can be distorted in a variety of ways. These distortions can be positive or negative. People who distort in a positive direction see the world in an unrealistically positive way-through rose-colored glasses. They lack critical judgment and may take chances that most people would wisely avoid (e.g., skydiving, investing large sums of money in a particular stock). If successful, the positive distorter is vindicated. If unsuccessful, the positive distorter may see failure as a consequence of taking a low-yield chance. Sometimes, the positive distorter takes chances that lead to situations of great danger. The positive distorter who experiences massive chest pains and does not consult a physician might reason, \"I\\'m too young and healthy for a heart attack.\" A huge amount of information surrounds you, and you must selectively attend to the information that is most valuable to your successful coping. Your capacity for selective attention, perception, and memory can serve a highly adaptive function. Cognitive theory tells us that because these cognitive processes are selective, there is a potential for distorting reality. As previously described, an individual who is depressed distorts reality in some highly dysfunctional ways. In cognitive therapy, individuals who are depressed learn to monitor these cognitive distortions and decide how to modify them. Although the distortions related to depression are negative and can lead to dysfunctional behavior, some distortions can, under some circumstances, serve adaptive functions as well. For example, individuals who are not depressed tend to systematically overestimate their abilities and their capacity to influence outcomes (Seligman, 1991). Cognitive distortions may protect a person from the effects of uncontrollable situations. For the most part, people tend to be optimistic about their future and their ability to meet the challenges of life. Although their expectations may not always be accurate, this sense of invulnerability may serve an adaptive function. It does not hurt to be hopeful. The absence of hope leads to depression. Although not always harmful, when unchecked, cognitive distortions can have a hazardous, negative effect, as in the most severe cases of suicidal individuals. Because cognitive distortions can contribute to significant emotional difficulties 25 Schemas and can be identified readily, they are a legitimate focus of psychotherapy. Cognitive distortions typically do not appear in isolation but occur in combination with other thoughts. Some types of distortions overlap. This overlap reflects systematic tendendes to misinterpret events. These related cognitive distortions are so automatic that they are difficult to identify without therapy. One common theme of misinterpretation involves self-evaluation. Depression may be related to an individual\\'s tendency to adopt goals or standards that are unreasonably high or from an increased sensitivity to variations from one\\'s own standards. This theme may begin early in life from parental expectations or when a traumatic event, an environmental stressor, or a loss initiates a depressive episode. Following specific events, people may experience a heightened state of self-awareness, and becoming increasingly aware of their inability to meet standards of coping, people may accept greater responsibility for negative events and outcomes. This may serve a psychological defensive function of internal control in the face of uncontrollable external events. This is consistent with Beck\\'s (1967; 1976) emphasis on cognitive distortions such as magnification among individuals who are depressed. This serves as a powerful example of how depression is thus characterized by a tendency to overgeneralize from single, specific failures to a broader sense of personal inadequacy. Similarly, individuals who are depressed blame themselves more than do those who are not depressed; that is, they have an increased tendency to attribute failures or negative events to character deficits (which cannot be controlled) rather than to their behavior (which can be controlled). Individuals who are depressed typically manifest high levels of pessimism and the idea that important outcomes are uncontrollable or unattainable. Cognitive distortions are both reflections of and are maintained by your schemas, the product of related sets of beliefs serving as a framework for your life. Although you may not be directly aware of your schemas, they underlie and maintain your belief system and thoughts that occur automatically. Schemas are arranged in a hierarchy (from less important to more important) and include a coordinated set of abstract ideas about self, world, and relationships. Your beliefs and coping mechanisms are derived from these schemas. Schemas direct your attention and influence your perception; the way you interpret information. Your cognitive schemas influence the content of your beliefs, automatic thoughts, and the process by which this information is retrieved and used. The schemas become, in effect, how you define yourself. The schemas can be active or dormant, with the more active schemas represented by those rules that govern day-to-day behavior. The dormant schemas are typically called into play to control behavior in times of stress. Schemas may be either compelling or noncompelling. The more compelling the schema, the more likely it is that you will respond to it. 26 Your schemas are actively developed and serve an adaptive function in that they help you efficiently evaluate your circumstances and guide coping attempts. They are the unspoken rules that you live by and typically are not open to evaluation. Schemas and assumptions are established in early childhood and are refined and consolidated by later experiences. The extent to which a schema affects your life depends on several factors: (1) how strongly held the schema is, (2) how the schema is linked with your well-being or existence, (3) the amount of questioning you engage in when a particular schema is activated, (4) your previous learning about the importance and essential nature of a particular schema, and (5) how early in your life a particular schema developed. Although schemas are in one sense permanent, they must also be in a constant state of change to succeed in being adaptive. From a child\\'s earliest years, there is a need to alter old schemas and develop new schemas to meet the increasingly complex demands of the world. An infant\\'s developing concept of reality is governed by limited interaction with the world, so the infant may initially perceive the world as the crib and the mother (or others who care for the infant). As infants master the additional skills of mobility and interaction, they then perceive their world as significantly larger. This process of altering schemas to better fit new experiences is called accommodation (Piaget, 1966). You use old rules as long as they work and change them only when you have to. When you encounter a new situation, you use old learning to try to cope with it. If the old learning works, you have no need to make changes, and you continue in your old pattern. If the old methods do not work, you make a slight change. If the change works, you make no further changes. If this small change does not work, you may make successively larger changes until you reach the desired effect. Schemas then become self-selective because you may ignore environmental stimuli that you are not able to integrate. Some individuals may persist in using old structures without fitting them to the new circumstances in which they are involved. Thus they may further fail to accommodate or build new cognitive structures for understanding the world. The schemas of individuals who are depressed frequently center on specific themes of vulnerability to loss or abandonment and on personal inadequacy. Although these schemas may not be active much of the time, they can be activated by specific negative life events. These schemas of vulnerability, then, may be seen as causal factors that make people vulnerable to depression under similar circumstances. Further evidence for the role of schemas in depressive disorders comes from the field of social psychology. Individuals who are depressed may possess an attributional style (a characteristic way of understanding cause-and-effect) that contributes to ongoing feelings of vulnerability. Schemas of hopelessness and self-reproach are frequently cardinal symptoms of depression, and are 27 believed to be activated by someone\\'s perception of a personally meaningful deprivation, loss, or disappointment. For example, Debbie, a 26-year-old single woman, became highly depressed and suicidal after her boyfriend of 1 month left her for another woman. Her specific thoughts centered on themes of loss, personal inadequacy, and the necessity of romantic relationships to her sense of self-worth. These beliefs appear to have been long-standing. Debbie was the youngest of six children and had been unplanned. Her parents had vowed to have no more after five, and had told her that she was unwanted because her older brother had been so difficult. She described her father as critical and unsupportive of her mother and the female children in her family. Debbie\\'s cognitive distortions included magnification of personal deficits such as physical attractiveness (which was highly valued because of its importance in attracting men), minimization of personal attributes, and selective inattention to positive experiences. This example illustrates how cognitive schemas and assumptions are based on individuals\\' life experiences and perceptions, which are highly personal and idiosyncratic. Nonetheless, beliefs and assumptions may be shared by people with similar experiences and may be widely accepted by specific social or cultural groups. Assumptions and schemas can, under specific circumstances, become a wellspring from which cognitive distortions and maladaptive beliefs emerge. Although they may be latent much of the time, schemas may be activated by external events that are similar to the experiences that contributed to their establishment. When activated, specific beliefs, distortions, and styles of thinking become apparent. An individual\\'s assumptions and beliefs are of various strengths. The person\\'s degree of belief in them and their importance to the person\\'s sense of self determine the extent to which a schema may serve as a source of cognitive distortions. How you respond to the activation of specific schemas can change their effect on your emotions. If you have the belief, for example, that \"people should always love me,\" you might become dependent and helpless, always seeking support and reassurance, and continually vigilant for signs of others\\' lack of interest or annoyance. Alternatively, such an individual might become an outstanding college professor, actor, or politician who constantly seeks approval. The manner in which you respond to the activation of a schema influences the feedback you will receive from others and from your environment. This feedback-and your selective attention to it-serves to consolidate your belief system. Individuals do not simply attach meaning to environmental events. Rather, they approach situations and events in a goal-directed (yet unrecognized) manner and actively develop the situation to make it consistent with the belief II 28 system. In this way, maladaptive schemas are further validated. Schemas may be based on a range of issues. They appear to include beliefs about self, relationships with others, the world, and the future. The schemas of a person who is depressed might include beliefs such as \"I am unlovable\" and \"Life is a continuous struggle.\" Clinical syndromes may be distinguished in terms of the specific content of the underlying belief system. As we have noted previously, the beliefs of individuals who are depressed typically center on themes of personal inadequacy and vulnerability to loss. The process of clarifying and resolving maladaptive schemas is central to cognitive therapy and this program. As the faulty schemas that underlie your depressive episodes are understood and resolved, your potential for depression relapse is reduced because life is no longer filtered through networks of negative beliefs. 29 Chapter 2 Review 1. Identify from which area your own cognitive distortions most likely arise (i.e., yourself, your situation, the future). 2. Can cognitive distortions ever be useful or helpful? How? 3. Name the three parts of the cognitive triad and how they affect you. 4. Identify at least two basic rules of life or schemas that you have. 5. How do schemas affect your behavior? II 30 Understanding Your Body: The Bof the BEAST The goals of this chapter are to understand the interaction of the body and depression how diet and nutrition affect depression how health problems can add to or cause depression the effects of brain chemistry on depression how medication can help In the past several decades, great advances have been made in understanding brain chemistry, bodily reactions, and depression. Affect problems have a significant physical dimension, just as physical problems may have a significant affective component. Every major physical system of your body can be affected by depression and can, in tum, contribute to it. You may feel weak (muscular system), experience stomach or bowel upset (digestive system), and feel shaky, tingly, or dizzy (neurological system). You may lose your sexual urge (reproductive system), have the need to urinate frequently (urinary system), or sweat more than usual (dermal system). The Biology of Depression Some of the best methods for dealing with the physical aspect of the BEAST are the most direct. Rather than sitting around waiting for the depression to lift and for the physical symptoms to stop, you can go right to the heart of the problem. You must respect your body with proper diet, exercise, and sufficient sleep. Your first response may be to say, \"If I could do those things, I wouldn\\'t need this book.\" You are right, in a way, at this point in your life. However, you might have been able to do them at some previous point without any help. We are going to work at reestablishing the patterns that work best for you. 31 II Mood and Diet Sometimes you may have trouble eating because your insides feel as though they are in a knot. For many of you, loss of appetite is the first sign of depression. If the depression is mild, you may experience diminished desire for food. You may not look forward to eating with the same enjoyment. Even highly spiced food may seem bland and uninteresting. As the depression increases, you may miss a meal and not realize it because your appetite is gone. At the most severe level, you may have to force yourself to eat (sometimes even be forced to eat). A return of appetite may signal that the depression is lifting. Then again, you may believe that eating is the solution. Although it may seem strange, overeating is similar to undereating as a symptom, in that food consumption is affected by mood. Food may not give any enjoyment. You may not taste food or enjoy the subtle flavors of well-prepared meals. In this situation, you just eat-and eat and eat and eat. You may sometimes tell yourself that you deserve to eat because everything else in your life stinks. lf you ask yourself if you are really enjoying the food, your answer may be no. Diet and nutrition can have a significant influence on depression. When the BEAST is in charge, you may make very poor food choices. You may consume an overabundance of sugar and not enough protein. Although a quart (or gallon) of double-mocha fudge ice cream may seem to be just what the doctor ordered, eating that much can make you more depressed (\"Look at me, sitting here gorging myself\"), and the aftermath can strengthen the BEAST (\"I can\\'t believe it: I\\'ve gained 10 pounds in the past month\"). II 32 The high sugar intake may also cause a quick drop of blood sugar later on, with the accompanying feeling of being down. With a low energy level, you may not fix healthy meals and instead end up with junk food. A diet of cookies, potato chips, soda, and ice cream may be easy and available, but it is a nutritional disaster for you and a gourmet feast for the BEAST. Many people skip meals as a result of rushing, minimizing the importance of food, or attempting an ill-advised form of diet. Without fuel, the body becomes depleted physically and emotionally. Your first exercise in this section is to report what you ate yesterday and when. li1 Morning meal (time of day): m Snack(s) (time of day): ~ Midday meal (time of day): ~ Snack(s) (time of day): }~ Evening meal (time of day): iii Snack(s) (time of day): 33 A poor diet has specific effects. Too little protein can affect energy levels. Too much sugar can lead to a rapid rise and subsequent drops in activity and concentration. Not eating fiber can affect regularity, which can also have an impact on your mood. Note in the brief survey of your food intake yesterday whether any of the following statements is true. Somewhat Untrue True Very True 1. You are skipping meals. 2. There is little protein and an abundance of sweets in your diet. 3 Few, if any, fiber-rich foods fruits, vegetables, and grains) are in your diet. 4. The number of calories in your Idiet is extremely high or low. If any of your responses to the survey is very true, then it may be time to adjust your diet. Experiment with a better diet for a week. Keep a diary of what you eat, along with monitoring your mood. In this way, you can more easily determine whether changing your diet may enhance your mood. Certain kinds of food may alleviate some symptoms of depression. t-tryptophan, an amino acid, is said to be associated with better sleep patterns. It is metabolized into melatonin. Taking any over-the-counter version of these compounds is not recommended unless you are supervised by a medical doctor, but certain common foods have t-tryptophan in them and are perfectly safe. Milk, broccoli, and turkey all contain high quantities of this chemical and may promote better sleep when you eat them regularly. And then there are foods that are dangerous to your sleep. Coffee, colas, chocolate, tea, and other beverages that have caffeine will make getting to sleep more difficult if you indulge a few hours before bedtime. Eating harder-to-digest foods such as red meats and proteins can keep you from getting to sleep as well. Better dinnertime choices are complex carbohydrates (like pasta, potatoes, and breads) and less animal protein. If you do not eat at regular times and have a diet without a balance of protein, carbohydrates, fiber, fresh fruit, and vegetables, you may be contributing to mood problems. Although a better diet is not usually the only solution to a better mood, it is important to your overall well-being. 34 Mood and Sleep Sleep difficulty is one of the major symptoms of depression. Studies have shown that individuals who are depressed have not only greater trouble falling asleep but also greater difficulty staying asleep. Your sleep may be very restless, and you may wake up earlier than you would like, feeling exhausted. This fatigue can affect your work and lead to daytime naps. The net result is a cycle of sleep difficulty in which you sleep during the day to compensate for your inability to sleep the night before, and then you are not able to fall asleep at night. The BEAST may rob you of sleep. Or make you feel so tired that you can hardly get out of bed. 35 Mood and Energy Loss When the BEAST is upon you, it saps your energy. Your energy level may shift during the day. You might wake up feeling energetic and back to your old self, only to feel your energy slip away throughout the day, or you may wake up feeling tired and then gain energy during the day. Some individuals who are depressed wake up fatigued, go to sleep fatigued, and then have trouble sleeping. One symptom of depression is a lack of energy to do anything. When you are depressed, you may feel as though you have run a 20-mile race without having moved a muscle. It is often a problem of inertia, which may feel like being stuck to the ground. Have you ever tried to push a heavy object such as a chair or appliance? What is the hardest part? Usually, it is getting the object moving or breaking through inertia. Once the object is in motion, it is easier to move. You start to build momentum, and that momentum contributes to the ease of motion. Doing the exercises in this program will help you break through inertia and build up momentum for change. Mood and Loss of Sexual Interest For some people, depression involves a loss of interest in sex, diminished sex drive, or an overall loss of interest in other people. If you are mildly depressed, there might be a slight loss of sexual interest or lowered responsiveness to sexual stimuli. As depression increases, you might become sexually interested or aroused only with considerable stimulation. If you are severely depressed, you may have an aversion to sex. II 36 Both physical and biochemical factors can be related to affect. Misinterpretation of physical problems may lead to emotional difficulties, and sometimes remedying a medical ailment can lead to improved mood. For example, Kristen \"felt\" she could not get out of bed, even though she woke up earlier than she had planned. Her body ached, she was tired, and her stomach felt so bad she thought she would never want to see solid food again. It was difficult for her to concentrate on anything; when she tried, her head ached. Kristen is definitely ailing. Is it a mood problem? It could be. She experienced early morning awakening, fatigue, muscle tension, and concentration problems. However, these problems could also be symptoms of the flu or some other physical malady. If it is the flu, improvement may not seem to come fast enough, but the probability is that Kristen will feel better in a few days if she gets rest, drinks liquids, and does not overexert herself. One of the first steps in treatment to relieve depression is to find out if depressive symptoms are being caused by medical problems. If you have not seen a physician in a long time (over a year is considered a long time), you should get a checkup, whether or not you think you may be depressed. Many treatable medical difficulties masquerade as depression, and physical problems involving pain (like headaches and stomachaches), muscle tension (muscle strain, cramps, and so on), and discomfort with internal organs should first be checked out by a medical doctor. If disease or other physical malady is ruled out, you may then proceed with the methods of cognitive therapy. 37 II Here is a partial list of symptoms to review. If any of these symptoms are pronounced, go to your doctor and get them checked before assuming that you have only a mood problem. 1. Sleep difficulties a. Frequent wakening b. Inability to fall asleep c. Sleeping more than 10 hours a night 2. Stomach/digestive problems a. Constipation/diarrhea b. Frequent nausea/vomiting c. Inability to eat solid foods 3. Muscle/skeletal symptoms a. Muscle/tendon/joint pain b. Knotting or constant cramping c. Constant fatigue d. Frequent or lengthy episodes of headache How Genetics Affect Moed Another aspect of the physical dimension of depression is genetics. Do some people inherit a tendency to be depressed? Although the answer is probably, no matter how a person becomes depressed, the methods to improve mood described in this program can be effective. The scientific pursuit to find a genetic code may eventually support genetic predisposition as one factor in developing mood problems. However, the influence of genetics cannot be studied in isolation because genetic and environmental influences are so interrelated. Parents may pass on a genetic code for low mood and negative thinking. They also influence thinking, situations, and actions in their children by their parenting skills and the behavior they model. Modeling is essentially setting an example. As a child, your most significant influences for how to be in the world are your parents. As you read this page, you may be way ahead, considering how your mother or father affected you and your actions and emotions. But where did they get their attitudes and beliefs?Just a genetic explanation is probably insufficient in most cases. Most studies done on mood and genetics require isolating factors. For example, studying identical twins who were raised apart allows more control over the nature-nurture debate. People who live in a culture that is contained and receives little influence from outside environments have also been the target of research in this area. II 38 There is no specific test or method we can give you to determine whether genetic inheritance is a factor that affects your mood difficulties. But what if it did? You are still faced with the same options about what to do next. History and genetics cannot be changed. This program asks you to ponder the present and make changes for a better future for yourself. 1. True or false: My parents and grandparents had problems with depression. That means I will have problems, too. (False. There is no test to tell if your mood problems are inherited.) 2. True or false: If I have a genetic predisposition for depression, I can get my genes altered. (False. No methods exist to alter your genes, unless you are talking about Levi\\'s jeans.) 3. True or false: If I eat right, I can probably improve my mood. (True. A good diet can help your mood.) 4. True or false: If I don\\'t get at least 8 hours of sleep a night, I will get depressed. (False. Sleep is different for different individuals. Lack of sleep can be a symptom of depression, but sleep alone is not a determining factor.) S. True or false: Being in good physical condition will enhance my effort to improve my mood. (True. Keeping your body healthy can influence your self-esteem and how you feel.) Bodies, Chemistry, Medication, and Depression Medications may be effective for depression by interacting with the physical aspects of this condition. You have learned that when you have a headache, aspirin (or some similar medication) is effective, safe, and inexpensive. Similarly, medications for depression have been shown to be very effective in alleviating many symptoms relatively rapidly (often between 1 and 3 weeks). Although people have little difficulty taking drugs for problems such as hypertension, headaches, and infections, among many other physical afflictions, the idea of taking pills to improve their mood is uncomfortable for some individuals. For those who view depression as purely psychological, medication is often seen as a cop-out. Some people think medicine is a crutch for a problem that should be solved only with willpower; some mental health professionals also have a negative view of the use of medications for treatment of mood disorders. Other people fear developing a dependency on the pills. Large volumes of research support the effectiveness of medical treatment in combination with psychotherapy (Wright, 1987). Drug treatments may allow people to mobilize themselves in therapy to learn ways to change their thinking and behavior, a sort of kick start. New medications are safer and have fewer side 39 II effects than those used in the pioneer days of psychopharmacology. In the most severe cases of depression, antidepressant drugs may be lifesaving. In milder cases, medication is worth considering after you gain an understanding of what the drugs actually do or do not do. The biochemistry-and specifically the neurochemistry-in your body is always a component of emotion but not the only part of what you experience with depression. Antidepressants lift depression for many people through complex biological changes having to do with the transmission of impulses through the nervous system. Rather than relying on medication alone, you can increase your resources by combining medication and therapy. You can also change your neurochemistry when you change patterns of thinking and acting. Treating Depression with Medication This section describes specific ways that medication interacts with the body to improve affect. It includes technical terms that you may want to ask your therapist to explain. Information travels around your body on an extensive network of nerve cells called neurons. These neurons have a large bulb at one end and a long stem coming from the bulb. Messages in the form of electrical impulses move from one neuron to the next by the chemicals that the neurons transmit (e.g., serotonin). When neuron number one releases the neurotransmitters, they flood the space between neuron one and neuron two. When neuron two receives this stimulation, it is triggered to carry the message to neuron three, and so on down the line. A large percentage of the neurotransmitter substance (e.g., serotonin) then returns to the bulb at the end of the transmitting neuron in a process called teuptake. The leftover amounts are broken down into other substances by an enzyme called monoamine oxidase. Some antidepressants work to block reuptake, but others block the enzyme monoamine oxidase from breaking down the transmitters. With these types of medications, the desired result is that more neurotransmitters remain, which enables more transmissions to occur between neurons. This .change helps promote a better mood. How Fast Does It Work? When starting antidepressant medication, you need to know that the results are not experienced immediately. Unlike aspirin and other pain medications, which provide relief from symptoms in less than an hour, antidepressants take 2 to 3 weeks to build up to a therapeutic level in the body and must be taken daily as prescribed. The full effect desired may take 3 months or more to achieve. In the first few days or weeks, there may be some signs of improvement, but during this time the side effects are more likely to be noticed as well. II 40 Side Effects Most people experience some side effects when they take antidepressants. Not all of them may be bad, and many individuals notice no side effects at all. However, you need to be prepared for this possibility if you start a medical treatment. Every individual is different, and some classes or subclasses of these types of drugs are better suited for some people and not for others. The most important criterion for a good match of medication to individual is the main effect, improvement of mood and related bodily functioning, and you need to be patient with the potential secondary effects. Do not end your efforts with medication before you give it a chance to take effect because of the initial discomfort of side effects that may lessen over time. If you take an antidepressant, be sure to check with your physician if you experience secondary effects. These side effects are often easily accommodated. For example, dry mouth can be dealt with by chewtng gum or drinking more fluids. For many people, the body does the accommodation without much help. It is essential that a physician who is well versed in the use of psychotherapeutic drugs closely monitors your medication. Typically, medication for mood is administered initially in a lower than therapeutic dose to decrease the possibility of uncomfortable side effects as you slowly build up the level of the medication in your body. Once you are able to tolerate the first few days of medication, your physician (usually a psychiatrist) begins to increase the amount to get to a range that will ensure a main effect. The drug level in your bloodstream can be measured in the plasma of your blood. The suggested therapeutic dosage and actual blood plasma range vary. Both are monitored to ensure that you have the proper amount of medication to help you improve your mood. Because most people\\'s metabolic systems are different, individual attention to dosage is crucial. For this reason, never take a friend or family member\\'s antidepressant drugs. If you are taking antidepressants, it is imperative that you follow the dosage recommended by your doctor and do not experiment with dosages on your own. Some people are tempted to stop their medication once they start to feel better. The temptation to discontinue, if followed, may lead to a rebound effect, and you may experience araptd decline in mood. Please do not take such risks. Collaborate with your therapist and physician before making any sudden changes. Alcohol and. Antidepressants Alcohol and antidepressant medication should not be mixed. Alcohol interferes with the activity of antidepressants. Drinking not only can preempt the effects of medication but also can aggravate your mood problems by interfering with your medication\\'s effects on neurotransmission. Wines and some foods can cause great difficulty with certain types of antidepressants. Your medical doctor is the best source of information regarding diet and drugs, but you are the one who must use the information Wisely in your daily life. \\' 41 /I Deciding About Medication As we have said in other parts of this workbook, depression is not explained by a simple cause-and-effect relationship between biology and mood. Although medication may be extremely helpful for many people, it is not always necessary. Whether to use medication should be an informed decision that involves careful discussion with your physician. If your symptoms are very severe, listen to what your doctor says before ruling out the use of drugs in your treatment. If your symptoms are not moderate to severe, medication may not be what you need. Remember, these drugs are not without side effects. m 42 Chapter 3 Review 1.

Both are so important that they are worth looking at separately. If you try to combine them, you see neither your feelings nor your thoughts clearly. To illustrate this point, try the following exercise. Identify each of these statements as either a thought or a feeling. Thought Feeling 1. I feel like things will never get any better. o o 2. I feel like a loser. o o 3. I feel depressed. o o 4. I feel as if you don\\'t love me. o o 5. I feel sorry for you. o o 45 Thought Feeling 6. I feel angry. 0 0 7. I feel confused. 0 0 8. I feel calm. 0 0 9. I feel like a fifth wheel. 0 0 10. I feel unloved. 0 0 If you identified any statements other than numbers 3 and 6 as feelings, please read the following section very carefully. All of the other statements are thoughts. The fact that you use the phrase \"I feel\" does not necessarily make these statements feelings. In fact, by seeing them as feelings, you obscure the real feelings that are related to those thoughts. For example, if you say to yourself or others, \"I think that I\\'m a fifth wheel,\" you can identify how that makes you feel, perhaps \"I feel lonely.\" Let\\'s take a closer look at how emotions and thoughts relate to each other. Imagine this situation: You are at home at night. You are in bed and about to go to sleep. The lights are out, you have gotten too tired to read or watch TV and you feel comfortable with your head on the pillow and the covers over you. You then hear some noise at the window. Here are two different examples of \"cognitions\" or thoughts involving interpretations. Read them and fill in the answers to the questions that follow. Interpretation: When you hear the noise, you think, \"There\\'s a noise at the window. Someone is out there trying to break into the house. They want to rob me. If they get in, they might murder me! I would be helpless to do anything about it.\" 1. How would your body react to this interpretation of the situation? Would you feel relaxed and comfortable? 2. In a word or two, what would your emotions be with this interpretation? III 46 3. How would you react to this interpretation? What would you do? Alternative Interpretation: Look at the same situation with a different interpretation of the noise: \"There\\'s a noise at the window. The weatherman said there would be wind and rain tonight. I\\'m glad I kept the windows closed. I love the sound of the wind and rain blowing against the window. It\\'s so relaxing, and the grass and flowers sure need the water.\" 1. How would your body react to this interpretation of the situation? Would you feel relaxed and comfortable? 2. In a word or two, what would your accompanying emotions be with this interpretation? 3. How would you react to this interpretation? What would you do? This exercise illustrates the fact that the same situation interpreted in different ways may be associated with entirely different emotions and subsequent actions. Interpretation 1 might lead to fear and anxiety. However, you would probably feel calm and relaxed if you had made the alternative interpretation. In this case, your behavior would probably allow you to fall asleep. From this exercise, you can see that situation, thoughts, and emotions balance each other in the complex system by which you experience events. Consider what you experience with depression. 47 II The Importance of Feelings When you are depressed, it is not a good idea to trust your feelings as the basis for making decisions. Although feelings are valuable in most life experiences, they may sustain your misery when you are depressed. You may \"feel\" so bad that you do not enjoy doing anything. You may avoid others, eat poorly, and begin to hate yourself. These symptom-based decisions may maintain your depression if left unexamined. To get control over depression, you must work with your therapist to make decisions that are consistent with overcoming your depression, rather than decisions that are driven by your negative feelings. The ABCs of Emotion Albert Ellis, one of the pioneers of cognitive therapy, developed a model to explain how feelings are connected to other factors in your life. This model is known as the ABCs of emotion (Ellis & Harper, 1961). Activating Event Belief Consequences A BC Between the circumstances that lead to a change in your mood (A, activating event) and the emotional results (C, consequences), you make an interpretation based on your beliefs (B). By becoming aware of your biased, irrational beliefs and the distressing emotional fallout that is the consequence of those beliefs, you can begin to understand them and then change. For example, Sally has been sad for days because she thought she failed a test in school. Sally has a very high grade point average and has seldom performed poorly on tests. However, Sally continued to worry and imagined herself flunking the course and eventually having to quit school because of her grades. Unfortunately, after almost every exam she took, she experienced this period of sadness and worry with similar thoughts about her future. The activating event (A) was waiting for the results of the exam she completed. The consequence (C) was sadness and worry. What would you guess was the belief (B) associated with the activating event and consequence (see choices below)? 1. I should always make an A on my tests. 2. Tomorrow is another day. 3. I am not smart enough to get through school. 4. My parents do not give me enough support to help me do well in school. 11 48 If you chose 3, you were correct. Sally maintains a belief about herself that makes it hard for her to feel confident about her efforts. She has so much self-doubt that it seems to override her perspective on overall performance, past efforts, and positive sense of the future. Instead, she feels sad and worried, in large part because of an unreasonable belief (B). Many people get stuck by trying to pin problems on just one global factor. The situation may be part of the problem, but it is rarely the only explanation. There are external and internal factors that affect you, and in this program you will consider how you and the situation interact. People who are feeling depressed may try to find the \"core\" reason for their emotional pain. Most of the time, they wind up frustrated and feeling worse. It is much more productive to search for and change several different factors to improve mood than to seek the elusive key to release you from all problems. Being able to turn off emotional distress like a faucet is nice to imagine, but the world around you, your thoughts, and your biochemistry all interact and affect your ability to gain control over depression. Making some desirable changes in any of the interacting factors is an attainable goal. SelfCompassion as an Aid to Emotion Self-compassion means havtng mercy on yourself and giving yourself a break when you make a mistake. All of those old cliches are true. Everyone is human; we all make mistakes. The first step in becoming compassionate toward yourself is recognizing that you will continue to make mistakes. When people are depressed, they are more likely to be self-critical. Under the oppression of such self-criticism, the potential for constructive change is lessened. Perhaps there is another aspect to this problem. People who grow up in a critical environment accommodate in various ways. One way is to depend on criticism for external motivation and to know what changes to make. People who adapt this way may become more self-critical and depend on this attitude to push themselves. It is possible to cultivate more compassion toward yourself and to change your maladaptive patterns, even deeply ingrained ones, but it takes specific kinds of effort. To help you toward this goal, ask yourself these questions. When I am self-critical, do my criticisms sound like those I heard while I was growing up? If so, I can understand that this pattern was learned and can now teach myself differently. 49 Im1 How would I evaluate my efforts, skill development, and judgment in this situation? Be specific. What would I do if confronted with this situation again, taking all I can from this experience? Bespecific. ~ How would I feel toward someone else I care about who was in the same circumstance? You can learn to give yourself the same room to be human that you give to others. Remember, you cannot redo the past, but you can think of each experience as an opportunity to learn. You can anticipate similar situations in the future and avoid making the same mistakes. All of this is designed to help you improve your emotions and mood. That also means that you need to be reasonable in how you evaluate your own progress. Along the way you are going to make mistakes, and you will probably catch many of them. What you do when you realize each mistake is important. You can deal constructively with the situation by realisticallyevaluating your part in it rather than getting stuck in acycleofself-criticismandblame.Oneofthecentral goalsofthis program is enabling you to approach your problems in a more positive fashion. To begin this process, you can review points in this chapter by answering the following questions: 1. What are your general complaints? II 50 2. What are the primary specific problems? 3. How do these problems affect you? 4. Take this initial problem list and develop a more detailed and specific exhaustive problem list. s. How do you explain these problems to yourself? 6. How do you see these problems in relation to your depression? 7. What is your assumed general explanation for their cause? 51 8. How do you relate these problems to your depression, and what are your expectations about the outcome? 9. What evidence is there for your explanations or theories? 10. What alternative explanations, other than the ones you hold, might account for these connections? 11. How might the interaction of your thoughts, behavior, and life events result in depression? 12. How are your thoughts, behaviors, and the environment maintaining your depression? 13. How did you come to think and behave the way you do? Il!l 52 14. How would these ideas explain current and past events? 15. What predictions could be made about the ways your schemas and automatic thoughts will affect your feelings and behavior within and outside therapy? 16. What would be the evidence? You and your therapist (and friends and family) may have different explanations for your depression. The goal is not to convince other people of the correctness of your explanation but to see your explanation as a theory about yourself, the world! and your future. Theories of depression can be assessed with information and experience, and they can be revised when necessary. The aim is to help you distance yourself from your theory so that you can evaluate it. 53 Chapter 4 Review 1. True or false: Self-compassion is simply feeling sorry for yourself. 2. Is there a single event, fact, or insight that will totally change all of your feelings? 3. What do the ABCs of emotion stand for, and how can you use them to change what you feel? II 54 \\'lakingAction:TheAofthe BEAST The goals of this chapter are ~ to understand the importance of taking action to recover from depression II to identify activities and environments that are pleasurable ~ to break the habit of procrastination ~ to learn methods for improving your mood by engaging in new activities So far, this program has described depression and explained why doing something about your depression is important. This chapter begins to highlight several techniques for activities that are antidepressive. Why Make the Effort? As discussed inpreviouschapters, inertiaisstagnation, whichcanleadto a lowering ofmood. Action physicallyaffectssymptomsoflowmoodbypotentiallyactivating asenseofwell-being. Forexample,howdoyou feelafterexercise,likeabriskwalk or jog? Most people feel somerelief, and othersexperience a genuine, but temporary, improvement in mood. There are also neurochemical shifts, brain changes, and general physical activation that combat the lack of motivation associated with depression. Because moods are temporary, activities that help to improve mood must be repeated to sustain the effect. Your first step is trying activities and breaking the pattern of inertia (\"an object at rest tends to remain at rest\"), Aneasywayto beginto lookat the wayyourbehaviors and levelofactivityare related to your mood is to use an activity schedule. The activity schedule is a very important tool for your therapy program, so take the time and make the effort to understand it well. 55 Using the Activity Schedule Figure 5.1 is a blank activity schedule for you to photocopy. The days of the week are across the top, and the hours of the day are on the side. Keep a record of your activities daily and by the hour as illustrated in Figure 5.2. Do not let the simplicity of this method of observing and monitoring yourself fool you into thinking it will not have an impact on your efforts to change. This method will take you about 5 minutes a day. The sooner you record your data, the more reliable the information will be. (Remember the recency effect?) There are many useful purposes for this activity. 1. Your first few activity records will provide a baseline or record of how much activity you were involved in when you started this program. They will establish a starting point in your efforts to improve your life. If you are to find out if this program works, you will need to see how you were doing when you started as compared to how you are doing as you practice the self-enhancement assignments. 2. By observing your activities and how you feel when you participate in these activities, you can find out how often you feel down and what situations are associated with feeling more or less emotionally distressed. Along with your activities, write down what you were feeling while you engaged in the activity. Rating the sense of mastery and pleasure you felt during this activity will be discussed below. 3. By filling in a box for each hour of the day, you can examine specifically what is happening in your daily life and how your activities are related to your mood. You will be writing a notation in each box about what you were doing (actions) during each hour. You can write in a few words that remind you of the event that occurred. The more activities you record, the more useful this task is likely to be for you. Take care to avoid labeling large blocks of time as \"sitting,\" \"in bed,\" \"watching TV,\" or \"doing nothing. II Even while watching TV, you are probably involved in other behaviors. Once you have recorded your first activity schedule, you will have begun accomplishing several goals. You will be able to 1. assess your present use of time 2. plan better and more productive use of your time to attack depression and hopelessness 3. start to get into the idea of doing self-enhancement assignments 4. begin to test the ideas you may have that you are doing nothing 56 Note: Grade activitiesfor Mastery (M) and Pleasure (P) on a scale from 0-10 Monday M P Tuesday M P Wednesday M P Thursday M P Friday M P Saturday M P Sunday M P 6-8 am 8-10 am 10 am-12 pm 12-2 pm 2-4 pm 4-6 pm 6-8 pm 8-10 pm 10 pm-12 am 12-6 am UI ~ Adivity Schedule Week # Date: Note: Gradeactivitiesfor Mastery (M)and Pleasure(P)onascalefrom0-10 ~ Monday M P Tuesday M P Wednesday M P Thursday M P Friday M P Saturday M P Sunday M P Ham Get Lip Get LIp 2.

Scheduling usually requires planning an hour, a day, or a week in advance. The goal of activity scheduling is to maximize your potential for productivity by making more effective use of the available time. Recording Your Sense of Mastery and Pleasure in Activities Another important part of monitoring your activity is to start to evaluate not only what you do but also how much of a sense of mastery and how much pleasure you experience with these activities. As you can see, the instructions at the top of the activity schedule tell you to fill out each hour with the activity you are involved in and then rate it for mastery and pleasure on a scale of 0 to 10. Mastery is your ability to perform the activity. A score of 10 would indicate you are performing a task with exceptional skill; a score of 0 would mean you barely know what you are doing and sense you are accomplishing nothing in spite of your efforts. Pleasure is your sense of satisfaction with the task or activity described. A score of 10 would mean that you are having more fun and enjoyment than at almost any previous time in your life. A pleasure rating of 0 would indicate misery and unhappiness. An enduring sense of pleasure or mastery is not usually present at the same time as depression. Therefore, by monitoring these experiences, you can more accurately assess mood fluctuation throughout the day. Once again, remember the recency and primacy effects; we tend to report the things that just happened and the things that occurred first in a sequence more accurately than other events that we experience. Try to fill out the activity schedule at the end of each day or in the morning and in the evening. The longer you delay, the less accurate your memory will be. 59 Figure 5.2 is an example of how the activity schedule is completed. Remember, for each activity you will be judging your experience of mastery and pleasure. One measure does not always affect the other. For example, if you are doing the dishes, you may have a particular method for getting them squeaky clean. You have mastered the art of dishwashing at a world-class level, so give yourself a mastery level of 9 or 10. However, you get no enjoyment from doing this job except relief from finishing the task. The pleasure rating would be a 4. Of course, there is no way to check your ratings for absolute accuracy. They are subjective. You may find that the situations you track on the activity schedule will vary in how you experience events emotionally (pleasure) and by evaluation (mastery). One way to adjust your system to be consistent is to look at anything above the rating of 5 as above average for mastery or pleasure. A 10 would be the best you have ever experienced, and a 0 would represent the worst ever encountered. Let\\'s take another example. You are learning to use a computer. You still have not figured out the difference between a hard drive and a hard-to-understand manual, but you have enjoyed the process of playing with your new \"toy.\" Your mastery rating may be a 1. Because you are having fun exploring the computer, however, it is possible that your pleasure rating could be a 7, even if you hardly know what you are doing. Name an activity that gives you pleasure but that you have little skill (mastery) in performing. Now, list an activity you have mastery in but from which you derive little pleasure. ~ Next, list an activity in which you have little mastery and little pleasure. Finally, name an activity for which you experience high levels of both mastery and pleasure. The reason for recording your mastery and pleasure of activities is to make an effort to observe in a much more systematic manner how your mood varies. If asked how often low mood is experienced, many individuals who are depressed say, \"All the time\" and perhaps not realize that the mood was associated with a low-pleasure activity. This reported experience is probably influenced by the 60 primacy and recency effects. If you say you are depressed all or most of the time, you are operating from an untested theory about yourself that does not take situational factors into account. If you accept theory as fact, without examination of evidence to test a theory, you could be sustaining a belief that will keep you depressed. If you examine factors such as pleasure derived from your activities, you corne to a better understanding of the controllable factors that contribute to your depression. Testing Theory with Observation In addition to using the activity schedule to learn more about daily mood patterns, you can test your theory by counting the total number of squares filled in on your activity schedule once you finish the week. This number represents 100% or the total. Then count the number of squares, first, where the pleasure rating is 5 or above and, second, where the mastery rating is 5 or above. On a calculator, divide the high-pleasure number by the total and get a percentage for pleasure. Do the same for mastery. Remember, before you actually collect the information over a given week, you have only an untested theory of the result. What is your theory about how much of your activity will rate above 5 for mastery? Before After ;;~!~ None Less than 25% Less than 50% Less than 75% All Actual result What is your best guess about the percentage of activity that will rate above 5 for pleasure? Before After \\\\ -;1 None Actual result Less than 25% Less than 50% Less than 75% All If you have underestimated the amount of pleasure you experience in a week\\'s time, you could have a tendency to go with the primacy and recency effects when you experience low mood. If you overestimated the amount of pleasure you derive 61 from your experiences of the week, you may have a core of optimism that you will want to work on keeping. If you were right about mastery and pleasure ratings in advance of your efforts to collect the information on yourself, your understanding of your mood patterns and activity seems accurate. The information from your activity schedule efforts will be valuable in a variety of ways. If the accuracy of your prediction was way off, then you may have a negatively or positively biased view of the future that is worth looking at more carefully. Also, no matter how accurate your prediction was, the observations in your personal activity schedule will give you important information to work with in this program. Identifying Patterns Associated with Low Mood You will begin to identify recurring events or associations of events that you may not have been aware of before you began recording your activities. L Patterns of low mood. Were there any recurring situations or events that were associated with feeling bad? Time Recurring Event Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday 2. Environment associated with low mood. Were there any places that seemed to be connected to being depressed? Were there places where you felt better? Place Mood Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday III 62 3. People and mood. Was your mood likely to be better or worse around certain people? Person Mood Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday 4. Activities. Were there certain things that you did that seemed to be related to fluctuation in your mood? Activity Mood Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Making the Effort to Change: Why Do Today What I Can Put Off Until Tomorrow? A common characteristic of people who are depressed is their lack of goal-directed activity, maintained by a tendency to procrastinate. Ask yourself this question: Am I engaging in activities with the same frequency that I used to? If the answer is no, your activity level is down. How many times have you promised yourself or others that as soon as you are less depressed you will get around to it (a round TUIT)? This is procrastination. We have created the TUITbutton to remind you that now may be the best time to do the activities that you have been putting off. Everyone has reasons for not doing today what they can do tomorrow. A problem develops when many of the things that you usually do are put off. A significant 63 fill decrease in activities has many effects on you. At first glance, you may appear to be avoiding criticism or failure. You may even think that you are avoiding activities that do not really matter or that you cannot possibly complete. Avoiding activities leads only to more avoidance, and lack of activity will delay your recovery from depression. In the early 1980s, a famous artificial heart transplant operation was performed. A man named Barney needed a new heart, or he was going to die. A human heart was not available, so a mechanical one was used to help him survive until a biological heart became available. Barney survived the surgery and was in good spirits when he was initially in recovery. Two days after the operation, he had a sip of beer and a conversation with President Ronald Reagan on the telephone. He said he was glad to be alive. But as the weeks went by, he started to become depressed. What do you think the doctors and nurses did to help Barney with his depression? They did not give him antidepressants because they were concerned about how antidepressants might interact with the medicines he was taking to keep him from rejecting the heart. They may have tried to get him to \"think positively,\" .but that was not the most effective intervention. Barney\\'s mood improved when he got up on a walking device with his artificial heart motor in tow. He walked laps around the hospital floor. Movement-going from inactivity to some type of action-helped to improve Barney\\'s mood. Action can promote a significant change in mood. Interrupting the inactivity of depression is a powerful way to start treatment. Increased action can promote a chemical change in the body that improves mood. Have you ever felt so down that you wanted to stay home or even in bed all day? If you did stay put, did it help you feel better? Probably not. One of the things we work with in therapy is how you act. 64 Two exercises follow that can help you understand and improve your low activity level. The first is a series of questions about what you\\'ve been doing recently. The second is a diary of the basic activities of your day. 1. Are you spending more time in bed each day than you used to? 2. Have you stopped doing enjoyable things with your family? 3. Have you stopped doing enjoyable things with your friends? 4. Do things that used to be pleasant for you now fall flat? 5. Do you find yourself waiting for the \"perfect\" time to do something? 6. Do you find yourself starting projects but not completing them? 7. Do you say to yourself, \"It doesn\\'t really matter\" more often? 8. Do you find yourself just too busy to do the things that you need to? 9. Do you find yourself \"forgetting\" more often than you used to? 10. Is being a procrastinator a good excuse for not doing anything? 11. Is your work receiving more criticism than it used to? 12. Have you been taking less time on your appearance lately? All of these questions point to a diminished activity level and a lack of pleasure from previously enjoyed activities. The BEAST of depression is maintained by lack of activity. The lack of activity drains you, and depression is the result. Now that you have examined your activities and the ways that your activities may be systematically related to your moods, you can begin to use this information. By planning each day ahead of time, you become an active agent in planning your life. You may now use your knowledge about how your activities affect your mood in scheduling. Fill out the planning schedule (Figure 5.3). After you have planned your day\\'s activities, you should set your plan aside and go about your day. At the end of the day when you review your activity schedule, you will see which activities you actually engaged in and how much pleasure (P) you experienced during the activity. You will be using the planning schedule and the activity schedule throughout the program. If you photocopy both forms now, you will always have blank copies available. This process of active planning and then monitoring the patterns of your activities and moods will help you overcome depression and lower your risk of relapse. Your therapist can be an active partner in helping you identify and understand these patterns. 65 Month: ~ Monday, Date: Thursday, Date: Tuesday, Date: Friday, Date: Wednesday, Date: Saturday, Date: Sunday, Date: ~:~ii;Ifi~:~~~ Planning Schedule Recovering Lost Activity Have you ever asked yourself, \"Why did I stop doing that?\" when you see someone engaged in an activity you once enjoyed? People often ask that question even when they are not having serious problems with low mood. Now that you have worked through some of your low mood issues and are addressing them head on, perhaps it is time to think back and ask yourself that question about some of the activities you used to enjoy. What were some of the things that you did for fun last year that you no longer \"have time for\" or \"just can\\'t seem to get to\"? Rate each activity for pleasure on the 0 to 10 scale. Now, try the same exercise with activities from 3 years ago. Finally, list some things you did for fun 5 years ago that you no longer do. Rate these activities for pleasure as well. Are there any realistic reasons for no longer engaging in these activities? For example, if you once lived near the ocean and went sailing regularly but now live in a landlocked area, it may be difficult to go sailing routinely. However, you may find that you have nearly as much fun sailing on an inland lake. Sometimes activities you once engaged in are now difficult to be involved in for reasons beyond your control. However, with some effort, creative solutions can be found for seemingly impossible situations. The point is that, without examining those situations, you are more likely to stay in your unexamined routine. 67 Risk Taking Another antidepressive activity involves risk taking. Often as we get older, we stop taking risks. We are not suggesting that you take up sky diving, but we are suggesting that you try some new things. Sometimes we become comfortable in a daily routine. However, what was once comfortable (like old clothes) may no longer fit and instead is constricting or boring. So, if you always go to a certain Italian restaurant on Saturday night, maybe trying the new Greek restaurant would be enjoyable as a break in routine. By taking that risk, you might find that you really enjoy the new place. Remember to ask yourself, \"What\\'s the worst that can happen?\" You may not like the food as much, or you may enjoy the meal as well as your company for the evening. Graded Tasks You may feel incapable of altering the way you react to people and situations; you may also feel powerless to change the situations you face. Ifyou see possible goals as too large or too far away, the technique of graded tasks breaks big jobs into smaller ones. Graded task assignments are derived from behavioral shaping strategies. Each small, sequential step approximates the eventual goal and helps you begin to expand activities in a gradual manner. It is important to take smaller steps at first to avoid failure and discouragement. Several smaller steps are far more effective than fewer larger steps. Ideally, the small steps can be rewarding as you start to take more of them. However, some individuals who have strong perfectionist tendencies may tell themselves that small steps are no big deal or not enough. Ifyou are this type of individual, it is important to confront perfectionism with the thought that a journey of 1,000 miles starts with a single step and continues one step at a time. You have to start from where you are. Clearly, the initial step in the sequence must be well within what you can do easily, and it must have some meaning for you. For example, for a severely depressed person, getting up and taking a walk or getting dressed in street clothes may be a monumental first step. Remember to acknowledge yourself for taking first steps; they are important in taking action and overcoming inertia. Behavioral Rehearsal Role playing is a very useful means of behavioral rehearsal. This technique is especially helpful when you can work on skill building with your therapist. The technique can be used to practice potential behaviors or interactions, such as dealing directly with a spouse, a significant other, a boss, or a friend. Your therapist can give you feedback about your performance and may even coach you on more effective responses and response styles. This strategy may be used for both skill building and practice of existing skills. 68 Social Skills Training When we find ourselves having social problems, sometimes it happens because we are depressed. The important question-and it is a hard one-is this: \"Did you have social difficulties before you were depressed?\" If the answer is yes, then social skills training may be an essential part of your therapy. The problem may include lack of social skills and not just lack of motivation. Part of the work of your therapy may be helping you refine your social skills. Identification of specific skill problems and appropriate social skills training is customarily done in consultation with your therapist and practiced between sessions. Relaxation Breathing Exercises Anxiety frequently accompanies depression. Progressive relaxation, focused breathing, and meditation can relieve anxiety and help you gain a sense of control over your life. Progressive relaxation involves learning to relax small muscle groups, one at a time. It is a technique that y-ou can learn with your therapist and begin practicing at home. Another useful technique is patterned breathing, which involves learning to breathe according to a model, such as a square or rectangle, or according to a slower rhythm. You can learn to imagine a figure and breathe in through your nose to a count of 2 or 3 (whichever is more comfortable). Then hold your breath for a similar count. This is followed by relaxed exhalation through your mouth to a 3 or 4 count, followed again by holding your breath for a count of 2 or 3. This pattern is repeated 10 times. This slowed rhythm serves to stop hyperventilation. Imagining the figure is optional in helping you learn to breathe in a slower rhythm. 69 II Chapter 5 Review 1. True or false: When you feel depressed, the best thing to do is to get into bed and wait until you feel better. 2. What do we mean by doing something to a point of mastery? 3. What do we mean by scheduling pleasure? 4. Which maintains the BEAST of depression, activity or procrastination? S. How does a \"graded task\" work? What is an example of one you might try? III 70 Life Situations and Vulnerability: The Sof the BEAST The goals of this chapter are IS to understand the relationship between mood and life circumstances YA to gain control when presented with life situations such as the following: II \"I lost my job.\" flll \"My mother died.\" l~ \"I am always in pain.\" ~ \"I am getting old.\" \"My wife left me.\" ~ to understand the role of vulnerability factors in depression ~ to learn how to decrease vulnerability to depression by evaluating and prioritizing stressors Understanding life Events You are often affected by events over which you have very little control. Wars start and end. The stock market goes up and down. Loved ones die. You become ill. You inherit money or incur debt. You are hired or fired. You fall in or out of love. The situations in your life are often linked to beliefs that affect your emotional equilibrium. Beliefs prepare you for some situations and not for others. For example, believing there is danger everywhere may be lifesaving if you are on guard in a war zone. However, this same belief may be unduly stressful in other circumstances. If you believe that nothing good will ever happen, you may occasionally avoid disappointment, but you may also miss out on valuable experiences. These beliefs 71 LI are often associated with depressed mood and an inability to recognize when good things do happen. Even if you live in a safe environment, such beliefs may occur automatically regardless of their appropriateness to the situation. This automatic but inappropriate reaction may create unwarranted discomfort. In this chapter, you will find ways to identify situations accurately and change your thoughts about situations that may be getting in the way of your happiness and fulfillment. You will not be able to make all negative things go away, but you can get through difficult times by adjusting your thoughts. The Unspoken Part of Life Situations Life is full of surprises, problems, rewards, and crises. Good things are the source of joy and happiness. Stressors are the source of anxiety and depression. People are typically not happy or joyful when life has delivered a problem or crisis. However, if you look at an experience, you can see that not only the external circumstance, but also your internal perception of the circumstance contributes to depression. For example, consider the statements at the beginning of the chapter. Although each represents a huge life stressor, the unspoken assumptions make things worse. Look over each of the same statements again, with the implied but unspoken assumptions. See how much worse the unspoken assumption makes an already bad situation. \"I lost my job (I will never find another).\" \"My mother died (I am all alone).\" \"I am always in pain (I cannot stand it).\" \"I am getting old (I will die soon).\" \"My wife left me (I cannot live without her).\" To illustrate this point further, if the person to whom these events occurred had a different view of the situation, the cognitive and emotional results would be quite different. Read the same statements with different assumptions. \"I lost my job (Now I can get a job I really enjoy).\" \"My mother died (She is finally at rest after her long and painful illness).\" \"I am always in pain (I can still walk, which is better than being confined to a bed).\" \"I am getting old (I now have the opportunity to do things 1never could before).\" \"My wife left me (I have learned from this experience and will seek a more compatible partner).\" 72 Certain life events are indisputably negative. The good news is that they are usually time-limited and specific to certain situations. You can pull from other areas of your life, including therapy, to learn to view these situations in different ways. It is possible to derive (or create) meaning from such experiences, no matter how awful they seem. When you are feeling down, you may think that the weight of the world is on your shoulders. Your first goal should be to identify the things you have to deal with. For example, you may think you have a million things to deal with. On further examination, you find that really only five or six things require your immediate attention. Recognizing that even one stressor can be more than enough to overwhelm you, we are going to try to make each stressful situation more manageable and less damaging. Identifying Stressors The first step is to identify your stressors. Divide them into two groups. First, list the specific stressors. These stressors are easily identified and recognized, such as job loss. They are the clearly seen events and circumstances that may get you down. List the situations that are currently contributing to your depression. Specific Stressors 1. 2. 3. 4. s. Now, identify the nonspecific stressors. This sort of stress is usually precipitated by a series of traumatic events, each in itself rather small. In combination they add up to a stressor that contributes to depression. An example is a traffic jam that makes you late for a meeting at your child\\'s school. Identify a series of stressors that are more general in nature. -~++ ++ -+-Vulnerability Fadors Vulnerability factors make you more likely to be affected by life situations, more sensitive to even small situational changes, and more reactive. They may cause you to overlook options for coping effectively and contribute to your failure to seek or initiate ways for coping. Review the following vulnerability factors, and indicate the ones that may apply to you. Specify a particular situation that might be affected. 1. Acute illness: When you are ill, your ability to cope with life stress decreases. Illness may range from a severe, debilitating sickness to more transient health problems such as headaches and viral infections. It is essential to be in consultation with a primary care physician so that these illnesses can be dealt with medically. Not seeing a medical doctor may increase the severity of depression. True Untrue How this affects me: 2. Chronic illness: In addition to acute illness, situations in which the health problem is chronic can lead to increased severity of suicidal thinking. True Untrue How this affects me: I!II 74 3. Deterioration of health: In aging, there may be a loss of activity because the body cannot perform up to the expectations that were appropriate at other times in your life. True Untrue How this affects me: 4. Hunger: During times of food deprivation, you are more vulnerable to a variety of stimuli. Studies have indicated that people who are hungry should not shop for food because of the probability of overpurchasing. True Untrue How this affects me: s. Anger: When you are angry, you may experience a loss of problemsolving ability. There may be a loss of impulse control or an increased response to stimuli that may usually be ignored. True Untrue How this affects me: 75 6. Fatigue: In a similar fashion, fatigue decreases both problem-solving strategies and impulse control. True Untrue How this affects me: 7. Loneliness: When you feel lonely, you may think that no one else understands you. You may be more sensitive about the interactions you have with other people. True Untrue How this affects me: 8. Major life loss: The loss of a significant other through death or divorce may lead you to think you have reduced options or that you do not care what happens to you. True Untrue How this affects me: 76 9. Poor problem-solving ability: Certain individuals may have impaired problem-solving ability. This deficit may not be obvious until the individual is placed in situations of great stress. Being able to deal with minor problems may never test the individual\\'s ability. True Untrue How this affects me: 10. Substance abuse: Substance abuse can increase depression and suicidal thinking. Overall, substances tend to lower thresholds. Problems from this source may be of two types: acute problems with compromised judgment during periods of intoxication and more chronic problems with judgment that is impaired more generally. True Untrue How this affects me: 11. Chronic pain: Chronic pain almost always lowers thresholds. Its effects may range from discomfort and a negative view of the future to hopelessness. True Untrue How this affects me: 77 12. Poor impulse control: Some people have poor impulse control because of organic (hyperactivity) or functional problems. People with poor impulse control tend to act before they think things out. True Untrue How this affects me: 13. New life circumstance: Changing jobs, getting married, moving to a new house, having a child, and going away to school are all stressors that serve to lower thresholds and increase vulnerability. True Untrue How this affects me: Evaluating Situation..Specific Vulnerability Each of the vulnerability factors can lower your threshold for stress and expose you to stimuli that contribute to depression. Often, vulnerability factors are situation-specific and affect you most in certain areas of your life. Following is a list of life areas that are problematic for some individuals. What is your threshold to these life events? Using a scale from 1 to 100, evaluate how much stress or difficulty you can manage in each of the areas. For example, if it takes very little to get you down, you have a low threshold (1). If you are able to take an enormous amount of stress in a particular area without reacting with depression, you have a high threshold (100). On the following scales, indicate your threshold for stress by marking a \"Til on the line. We have left spaces for you to write in other life stressors. I!I!I 78 LowVulnerability Threshold High Vulnerability Threshold 1. Dealingwith parents 1;50\\'100 2. Dealingwith work issues 1;50\\'100 3. Relationships 1:50\\'100 4. Sex 1 5010,0 5.

If the stress in one area of your life is 50 and your threshold is 40, you will probably feel overwhelmed in that area. If the stress in one area is 80 and your threshold is 85 in that area, you are likely to be able to continue coping well. When the stress in one or more areas increases over the threshold, more than one stressor occurs, or the stressors reduce the overall threshold, you may respond. with depression. Look over the areas on the list and determine if the actual amount of stress you are currently experiencing in each area is under or over your threshold. Indicate the amount of stress by placing an \"S\" on each line. Coping with Difficult Life Situations For those situations in which the amount of stress (S) currently exceeds your threshold (T), answer the following questions. Yes No ~ Can someone else handle this for you? o o ~ Can you postpone the situation? o o ~ Have you dealt with situations like o o this before? ~~ Do you know anyone who has dealt o o with this situation before? ~ Can you change parts of the situation? o o ~ Is the situation going to change o o with time? Count the yes and no answers. Totals If the number of no responses exceeds the yes responses, there is a greater chance for hopelessness and depression. Now answer the next set of questions. You will see that there are some very small changes to the questions. II 80 Yes No ~~ Is it possible that you do not have to deal with all of the situation by yourself? Is it possible to postpone a small part of the situation? 0 0 0 0 t:J Have you ever dealt with slightly similar situations? 0 0 ritrl Do you know anyone who has ever had to deal with anything like this before? 0 0 ~ Is it possible that parts of the situation are more easily changeable? 0 0 ftil Is it possible that the situation is going to change with time? 0 0 Count the yes and no answers. Totals Is there any difference in the number of yes responses between the first and second set of questions? You will probably have more yes answers the second time. The difference between the first set of questions and the second set is that in the first set there was little chance of change and more \"all-ot-nothing thinking.\" In the second set, we introduced the possibility of change and less all-or-nothlng thinking. Where do you go from here? The exercise you just completed illustrates the point that, by widening the scope of possibilities in coping with external stressors, hope is inspired. If you want to reach a goal, you need to do it one step at a time. By taking small steps, you can overcome large obstacles. Look at the specific situations in which the stressors overreach your threshold and contribute to your depression. Choose one and ask yourself the second set of questions about it. Write down one small part of that situation with which you can start coping. After that, choose another small part and then another and another. You can use the coping with stressors worksheet for this exercise. (See Figure 6.1) 81 Example: DefineTask-Clean my room Goal/Reward Hhish -task ,...\\' Dust furhiture ,...\\' Vac.1JJJJfI. ,...\\' Pic.k up dothes ,...\\' Begin task Make bed Define goal: have room lookih8 heater and more orde.r~ YourTurn: Define Task -_ GoallReward Begin task Define goal: _ Coping with Stressors Worksheet Prioritizing Stressors A final strategy for combating stressors when you are feeling overwhelmed is to arrange them according to which problems need your attention first. This strategy breaks a seemingly overwhelming situation into smaller, more manageable parts. For example, Judy came to therapy for her depression. The number of things in her life that had gone wrong and were likely .. 82 to go wrong overwhelmed her. She had just lost her job, was living on a small amount of savings, had not yet started collecting unemployment compensation, and had many unpaid bills. During her therapy session she made a list of all of the things she thought needed her immediate attention. Her therapist asked her to separate the list into three separate lists. List number 1 contained things that could be put off for at least a day. List number 2 included things she could ask others to do or help with. Things on the third list needed attention that very day. When Judy was able to separate these stressors, she discovered that the list requiring immediate attention was much smaller than she had previously thought. She even found that some of those situations could be dealt with quite easily. In fact, one situation was to make a call to the telephone company, which was threatening to turn off her phone. Clearly, she could not postpone it. After role playing several different scenarios with her therapist, Judy made the call from her therapist\\'s office. She found that her fear of being insulted, yelled at, or punished was not upheld. AfterJudy explained the situation, the customer relations representative suggested several solutions, including an extra week to pay a certain portion of the bill. 83 Chapter 6 Review 1. List the three major vulnerability factors that are likely to add to your depression. 2. What three life situations cause you the most discomfort or depression? 3. What effect do your identified life situations have on your mood? 4. Do negative life situations always have to lead to negative moods? How might you avoid this reaction? II 84 Thoughts and Depression: The Tofthe BEAST The goals of this chapter are to understand how your thoughts are categorized in the cognitive triad model to identify thinking patterns that maintain depression to understand the elements of cognitive distortions : to develop ability to work with techniques for challenging cognitive bias to learn how to rework your thoughts and improve your mood with the Thought Record In Chapter 2 we introduced the cognitive triad. The cognitive triad can help you start to divide the global experience of depression into smaller, more manageable pieces. The term triad describes the three negative views that characterize depression. Each view is characterized by thoughts that reflect that view. The first is the negative view you might have about yourself. These are the thoughts that include the personal pronouns I, me, or my. You might say to yourself: ~<] I am no good. \\'Ji Nobody likes me. ~.~ My work is terrible. The second element is the negative view and related thoughts that you might have about the world or your experience in the world. You might say to yourself: :r] People should be nicer. ~~ The world is an awful place. 85 II Finally, there is the negative view and related thoughts you might have about your future. You might say to yourself: Things will never get any better. I will always suffer. There is no hope. Many of life\\'s problems can be categorized into at least one of these categories of negative views and related thoughts. The accumulated content in each of these three views is evident in how you see the world overall, Your feelings and behavior typically correspond with the negative content of these views. For example, if you view yourself as physically unattractive, you may then avoid situations in which physical attractiveness might be seen as a prerequisite for success (e.g., dating). Negative View of Self Write down the thoughts you have about yourself that are negative. For example, do you say to yourself, ill am stupid\" or some other negative self-statements? Such negative statements are global and seem to come automatically. Do not stop now to evaluate whether these statements are true. What we would like you to do here is start to look at the negative things you say to and about yourself. Negative VDew of the World Now, write down the negative thoughts that you have about the world and your experiences. What ideas do you carry with you about your world? Do you say, \"All men [or women] are jerks\"? As before, do not stop yet to analyze whether these statements are true. IIlI 86 Negative View of the Future How do you see the future-the rest of your life? Do you focus on the idea that \"things will always be this bad\"? Do you predict negative results for things you might try to do in the future? Write down any specific negative thoughts that you have about the future in the space below. Now, review the groups of statements that you wrote to determine the degree to which your thoughts fit the cognitive triad model of depression. It is important for you to structure the program for relieving your depression first by paying special attention to the areas in which your thoughts are most negative. Personal issues relating to self, world, and future are different for each of us. Each part of the triad does not necessarily contribute equally to your experience of depression. By assessing the relative contribution of each of the three, you can begin to develop a clear understanding of your unique combination of negative thoughts. By including an assessment of each group of negative thoughts, your personalized program can be directed toward your own specific area of concern rather than toward vague, global problems. Cognitive Distortions As discussed in Chapter 2, distortions represent biased views that are not usually validated by other people. They represent a selectively narrow part of experience; usually negative. Distortions in thinking are frequently the initial focus of therapy because they are often easily identified. It is important for you to discover the distortions in your thinking by tracking your \"automatic thoughts\"-these spontaneous thoughts associated with certain moods and/or situations. These spontaneously generated thoughts can then be evaluated for the impact they have on your life. Recognizing these distortions and biases can point to underlying patterns in your thinking. The main purpose of discovering distortions is to allow you to begin to alter dysfunctional thoughts and thought patterns. Remember that people are usually biased because subjective personal experience influences perceptions. These biases become problematic when they are too extreme 87 II or are inappropriately relied upon. The following are examples of types of distorted thinking: 1. All-or-nothing thinking: thinking globally, considering only extreme options, although much of reality exists on a continuum. This is black or white with no shades of gray. I am either a success or a failure. Things are either completely right or absolutely wrong. I love you or I hate you. 2. Mind reading: thinking you know what others are thinking. They probably think I am incompetent. I just know that she disapproves. Even though people do not say so, I know how they really feel. 3. Emotional reasoning: the belief that if you feel something, it must be true and should be acted upon. I feel so inadequate, I must be inadequate. I feel so angry, I must express it. If I feel anxious, I should not go out. 4. Personalization: the belief that you are the target of difficulty. That comment was not just random; it must have been directed at me. Problems always emerge when I am in a hurry. Someone is always picking on me. 5. Overgeneralization: assuming that one incident applies to all others. Everything I do turns out wrong. It does not matter what my choices are; they always fall flat. My boyfriend broke up with me; no one wants me. 6. Catastrophizing: assuming the worst. If I go to the party, there will be terrible consequences. I better not try because I might fail, and I could not stand that. My fiancee broke our engagement; I will never get married. .. 88 7. Should and shouldn\\'t statements: reflecting a judgmental attitude. I should visit my family every time they want me to. They should be nicer to me. I should not feel angry [or scared or anxious]. 8. Need for control: the belief that absolute control is necessary. If I am not in complete control all the time, I am in danger of going out of control. I must be able to control everything in my life. I cannot let anyone else help. me with this task. They might do it wrong. 9. Negative comparisons: viewing your performance in comparison to others. I am not as competent as my co-workers or supervisors. Compared with others, there is clearly something flawed about me. Even though it is OK for other people to make mistakes, it is not OK for me to. 10. Disqualifying the positive: difficulty believing positive experience. This success experience was only a fluke. That compliment was unwarranted. Even though she said she liked my work, I know she did not mean it. 11. Perfectionism: the need to be perfect. If I cannot do everything perfectly, I will be criticized and feel like a failure. Doing merely an adequate job is akin to being a failure. When I make a mistake, I feel worthless. 12. Selective abstraction: missing the big picture. All those compliments do not matter. This criticism is the only thing that matters. I seem to dwell on the negative details and don\\'t pay attention to the positive aspects of a situation. Even though I received an overall positive review, I think that I am not doing a good job. 89 13. Externalization of self-worth: looking to others for self-validation. My worth is dependent upon what others think of me. They think I am (e.g., stupid, lazy); they must be right. I am not OK unless I am pleasing others. 14. If-only thinking: wishful or regretful thinking. If only my situation were different, all of my problems would.... If only I were taller, she would like me. If only I had not _ (e.g., made that decision, done that), I would be happy now. 15. Worry helps: believing that worrying equates with protection. If I think about it long enough, it will be resolved. One cannot be too concerned. If I forget to worry or let down my guard, something bad might happen. 16. If I ignore it: avoidance as a defense. If I ignore it, maybe it will go away. If I do not pay attention, I will not be held responsible. What I don\\'t know won\\'t hurt me. 17. Fairness: the belief that life should always work out the way you think it should. Life should be fair. People should be fair. Good behavior should always be rewarded. 18. I must be right: rigidly maintaining that one is right in all circumstances, despite contrary evidence. I must prove that I am right; being wrong is unacceptable. To be wrong is to be unforgivable or a bad person. If I am wrong about one thing, it means I am wrong about everything. 90 19. I can\\'t stand it: the belief that a specific situation or feeling is intolerable. I cannot stand to be angry without exploding. I cannot stand not knowing if he or she loves me; I must ask. If I experience happiness, something horrible will happen. 20. I can\\'t live without. ...: the belief that life is not worth living if a desire is unattainable. I cannot live without a man/woman. If I were in a relationship, all my problems would be solved. I cannot survive if I am alone. Review the list of distortions above, and circle those you are most likely to use. Write the ones you use most frequently in the following space. You may need to corne back to this section later to add distortions because these thoughts may occur automatically and be embedded in other thinking to the extent that they are difficult to recognize. 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. Changing Your Cognitive Patterns: Some Techniques Cognitive techniques are useful in challenging distorted and negative thinking patterns. Therapists use these techniques to examine and question such patterns. This therapeutic dialogue is an important part of cognitive therapy. This section lists such techniques and explains their purposes. You are encouraged to discuss these methods with your therapist. The Appendix at the end of this workbook illustrates each technique with sample dialogues that might occur in a therapy session. We have used the term \"Depressed you\" to indicate that when you are depressed you use many more negative thoughts to describe yourself. The \"Challenger\" is your internal questioner who is going to find out what these thoughts are really about. The Challenger will function much like your therapist 91 to widen your perspective and allow you to respond to the evidence you may not be attending to. You are encouraged to review the examples in the Appendix and apply them to your own internal dialogue. 1. Questioning what you really mean 2. Questioning the evidence 3. Reattribution 4. Examining options and alternatives 5. Decatastrophizing 6. Examining expected consequences 7. Listing advantages and disadvantages 8. Turning adversity to advantage 9. Labeling distortions 10. Guided association and discovery 11. Using paradox or exaggeration 12. Scaling 13. Replacement imagery 14. Cognitive rehearsal IS. Self-instruction or coaching 16. Thought stopping 17. Focusing 1. Questioning What You Really Mean You may not completely understand the terms you are using. If a group of 100 people were asked to describe depression, you would probably hear 100 different definitions. Descriptions might include words like sadness, the blues, hopelessness, sleep difficulties, sluggishness, slowed thinking, pessimism, apathy, and eating problems. Given the varying meanings that words have, itisessential toquestion what you mean when you use certain words. (See Example 1 in the Appendix.) Exercise: List some of the negative words you use to describe yourself. Then go back and challenge each word to determine what it really means to you. 92 Word I Use to Describe Myself Challenge the Word What Do I Really Mean? Example: Loser ? I make many mistakes. ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? In instances where the meaning of these words is negative, go back and ask yourself if there is evidence to support your self-defeating opinion. You will learn more about this technique in the next exercise. 2. Questioning the Evidence One effective way to challenge a dysfunctional thought is to examine the extent to which the thought is supported by available evidence. Askyourself if other 93 interpretations are more reasonable. It is essential to teach the \"Depressed you\" to question the evidence that you are using to maintain and strengthen an idea or belief. When you use selective abstraction, you may ignore major pieces of data and focus on the few aspects that support your depressive views. By questioning the evidence, you broaden your focus to include the entire reality rather than just the narrowly focused negative view. Even the slightest doubt in your initial, fixed belief could be the first step toward meaningful progress. (See Example 2 in the Appendix.) Exercise: Select three negative assumptions you have about yourself and your life. List them here. Then go back and challenge the evidence for each assumption. Negative Assumption Evidence 1. _ 2. _ 3. _ 3. Reattribution A common statement from individuals who are depressed is \"It\\'s all my fault,\" especially in situations of relationship difficulty. Some individuals take total responsibility for situations; others tend to blame someone else and take no responsibility whatsoever. Bybecoming a II Challenger,\" you can help yourself begin to distribute responsibility in a more realistic and accurate manner. By taking the middle ground, you can help the depressed you reattribute responsibility and not take all the blame or unrealistically shift all the blame to someone else. (SeeExample 3 in the Appendix.) Exercise: List negative events or circumstances for which you feel totally at fault. Then go back and ask yourself if anyone, other than yourself, may have shared in the responsibility. .. 94 Negative Event That\\'s Anyone Else Who May IIAll My Fault\" Be Involved 1. _ 2. _ 3. _ The purpose of this exercise is not to shift blame entirely from you to someone else but rather to reveal the fact that many circumstances are associated with a combination of people and events.. 4. Examining Options and Alternatives People who are suicidal see themselves as having lost all hope. Death might be the easiest choice. Thoughts of suicide represent an inability to think of other alternatives. The goal of this technique is to counter the inertia of depression by generating other options. Even one additional choice challenges the cognitive distortion that there are no alternatives. (See Example 4 in the Appendix.) Exercise: Make a list of situations in which you believe you had no options. Then list one or more alternatives that have become clear as you look back on the situation. If you have difficulty with this, consult with your therapist or someone whose judgment you respect. Situation in Which I Had Looking Back Now, I See \"No Options\" These Other Options 1. _ 2. _ 95 II 3. _ 5. Decatastrophizing When you catastrophize, you imagine the worst thing that could happen and then believe it will. Another way people catastrophize is to engage in \"what if\" thinking, imagining all the things that could go wrong. If you see an experience as potentially catastrophic, you can work to challenge whether you are overestimating the potential effects of the situation. Questions you might ask include: What is the worst thing that can happen? Could I survive that? Ifit does happen, how will my life be different 3 months from now? (See Example 5 in the Appendix) Exercise: First, write down an event or circumstance that you believed would lead to a catastrophe or disaster. Next, write what you thought would happen and then what actually happened. Event/Circumstance Expected What Actually Catastrophe Happened 1. _ 2. _ 3. _ This exercise is intended to remind you that consequences in the past have not always matched your catastrophic thinking. Even though bad things happened, the world did not end. 6. Examining Expected Consequences In this technique, you are asked to think about a situation and describe your concerns and expectations related to it. Often, describing expectations can reveal 96 misperceptions and irrational thinking. Alternatively, if the anticipated consequences are likely, you can realistically assess danger and develop effective coping strategies. An active examination of the style, format, and content of your expectations can yield good material for working with your therapist and challenging irrational thinking. (See Example 6 in the Appendix.) Exercise: List any negative expectations of people or events that may frighten you or negatively influence your behavior. Rank the chances that such an event will happen on a scale from 0-100%, and then list one to three options that may be appropriate to that expectation. You may want to rank-order these options in terms of effectiveness. Negative Expectation Chance of This IfThis Did Happening (0-100%) Happen, I Would 1. _ 2. _ 3. _ 7. Listing Advantages and Disadvantages Another approach is to look at the pros and cons of the beliefs that maintain depression. By focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of a particular behavior or way of thinking, you can achieve a more reasonable and adaptive perspective. This technique can be used to examine the adaptiveness of acting, thinking, and feeling certain ways. Although individuals who are depressed often claim that they cannot control their feelings, viewing personal options from a broader perspective can enhance your view of choices and your personal control. (See Example 7 in the Appendix) Exercise: List situations that are troublesome for you. Then, evaluate your different options for resolving each situation by listing advantages and disadvantages. 97 Specific Situation: Options for Advantages Disadvantages Resolving Situation 1. _ 2. _ 3. _ Specific Situation: Options for Advantages Disadvantages Resolving Situation 1. _ 98 2. _ 3. _ 8. Turniog Adversity to Advantage As is often the case, for each thing lost, something important is gained. Sometimes what seems like a disaster can be used to your advantage. Losing your job can be a disaster but may be the entry point to a better job or even a new career. A deadline may seem oppressive and unfair but may be used as a motivator. This technique asks the depressed you to look for potential creative or adaptive outcomes. Looking for the positives of a difficult situation can be challenging. The depressed you will sometimes respond with even greater negativity when the challenger points out positive possibilities. You may accuse the challenger of being unrealistic. The challenger can point \\'out that the positive view is no less real than the negative view. (See Example 8 in the Appendix.) Exercise: Think of negative events that have happened to you. For each event, try to think of one positive outcome or one thing that you learned from the event. Positive Outcome Negative Event (creative or adaptive) 1. _1. _ 2._2. _ 3._3. _ 4._4. _ 9. Labeling Distortions One of the first steps toward self-knowledge is identification of your own distortions or errors of thinking. Many individuals who are depressed may find it useful to label the cognitive distortions they notice among their automatic thoughts. Although not essential for improvement, labeling is often helpful because it helps you see things from a cognitive therapy perspective, and you understand the style and format of your distortions. Feeling Good (Burns, 1980) 99 is an excellent self-help book for learning more about cognitive distortions. (See Example 9 in the Appendix.) Exercise: Review the list of cognitive distortions mentioned previously. Practice labeling your negative thoughts using the distortions provided. Thought Type of Distortion 1. _ 2. _ 3. _ 10. Guided Association and Discovery Through simple questions like \"Then what?\" and \"What would that mean?\" the challenger can help the depressed you explore the significance you see in events and potentially uncover underlying assumptions and beliefs you were not previously aware of. Using the chained or guided association technique, the challenger works with the depressed you to connect ideas, thoughts, and images. Asking questions like \"What evidence do we have that that is true?\" allows the challenger to guide the depressed you toward your therapeutic goals. The guided association can be employed in helping the depressed you identify underlying assumptions or beliefs. This process is like peeling an onion, layer by layer. (See Example lOin the Appendix.) Exercise: Use guided association to challenge three negative thoughts. Negative Thought I Challenger\\'s Assumption Questions Answers 1. _ 100 2. _ 3. _ 11. Using Paradox orExaggeration Ironically, taking an idea to its extreme can make it possible to view a situation or thought from a more realistic position. (See Example 11 in the Appendix.) Exercise: Search for a negative thought you might have that may be exaggerated or extreme. Question yourself on it. Try saying it in an even more exaggerated way (e.g., I am unattractive; I really look like the Wicked Witch of the West). Ask yourself if your negative thought is realistic. Extreme negative thought: Question: Is this thought realistic? Answer: _ 101 Extreme negative thought: Question: Is this thought realistic? Answer: _ 12. Scaling Scaling is particularly useful for individuals who tend to see things as all or nothing, black or white. The technique of scaling-viewing things as existing on a continuum-helps people be more descriptive and therefore more objective. (See Example 12 in the Appendix.) Exercise: Rate events using this mood measure. Event: _ How sad were you? 1-:50,-100 ~~ ~~~~ Event: _ How angry were you? Not angry Extremely angry Event: _ How anxious were you? 1-50\\'100 Not anxious Extremely anxious 102 13. Replacement Imagery Not all automatic thoughts are verbal. Images and dreams can be valuable sources of material in therapy. If you have dysfunctional images, you can generate more effective coping images to replace the depressing or anxiety-producing ones. Athletes have discovered that imagining specific successful performances can lead to increased actual performance during competition. Similarly, the content of dreams can be examined from a cognitive perspective. Cognitive therapists view dreams as the active expression of the person. The following example demonstrates replacement imagery. A 31-year-old woman reported the following dream: \"I was sitting on the couch when out from the opposite wall came this huge snake. It struck at me with incredible speed, giving me no time to move away. It sank its fangs into my arm. All I could do was look at it and comment on the pain and the fact that it was biting me. I woke up feeling anxious and frightened.\" The basic cognitive elements were her view of herself as helpless and her perceived inability to effectively react. These cognitive positions paralleled her dysfunctional cognitions in her waking state. She was extremely effective on her job but often felt anxious when called upon to be assertive. Her therapist might help her restructure the experience by asking what she might have done differently in the dream. She could restructure the scene as she wished, now in her attentive, reflective state. As a challenger, how might she encourage herself to use more adaptive skills? At first, she restructured the dream tentatively, by visualizing herself trying to hold something over the snake hole in the wall. With further encouragement and some modeling from the therapist or the challenger, she restructured the scene so that she immediately severed the snake\\'s head. As she restructured the dream to one in which she took greater control and asserted herself, there was an immediate affect shift from anxiety to relief. In another technique, the dream is revisualized for the primary purpose of altering the negative elements. The snake could become a Sesame Street character, or the dreamer could offer the snake a treat or have a transparent shield. In restructuring the dream or image, a positive outcome can be effected. (See Example 13 in the Appendix.) 103 ~ Exercise: Summarize one of your own dreams and then restructure it. Original Dream: Restructured Dream: 14. Cognitive Rehearsal Byvisualizing an event in your mind, you can practice particular behaviors mentally. A number of athletes use this technique to enhance performance. By first generating a reasonable scene and practicing it mentally, you can investigate several possibilities by running each of them through your mind like a videotape. Pilots practice on a flight simulator to gain skills in this way. (See Example 14 in the Appendix.) Exercise: Think of something you would like to learn how to do or do better. Create a visual scenario with phases, and imagine specific steps that might lead to the desired result. Scene 1: Scene 2: 104 Scene 3: Goal: 15. Self-Instruction or Coaching The same process used in self-criticism can be used to learn and enhance new skills. For example, in learning impulse control, you can start with direct verbalization by saying self-instructions out loud. With practice, you learn to say the instructions without actual verbalizations, and eventually the instructions become more automatic. You can teach yourself to offer direct self-instructions or, in some cases, counterinstructions. In this technique, the challenger is not introducing anything new to the depressed you. Rather, you can utilize, change, and strengthen a technique that you have used before. (See Example 15 in the Appendix.) Exercise: Think of a situation in which you wish you could curb your impulse to act until you have cooled down or thought the situation over. What are some things you would like to tell yourself if you could wait before reacting to the situation? 105 16. Thought Stopping Dysfunctional thoughts often have a snowball effect. What may start as an insignificant problem can gather weight and momentum. Once on a roll, the thoughts seem to have a force of their own and are very hard to stop. Thought stopping is best used when the thoughts first start, rather than in the middle of the process. The depressed you can be taught to picture a stop sign, hear a bell, picture a wall, or say the word stop out loud or clap your hands. This technique may be practiced in a session with your therapist. You can then remind yourself of your success at stopping or interfering with your thoughts in your session or when you are practicing on your own between sessions. (See Example 16 in the Appendix) Exercise: What are some repetitive negative thoughts that emerge for you that you would like to stop? List them and then practice stopping them by saying, \"Stop!\" __________________________ Stop! __________________________ Stop! ___________________________ Stop! __________________________ Stop! __________________________ Stop! __________________________ Stop! __________________________ Stop! __________________________ Stop! __________________________ Stop! __________________________ Stop! t1. Focusing There is a limit to how many things you can think about at once. By occupying your mind with neutral thoughts or one neutral word, you can block dysfunctional thoughts. You might repeat a neutral word or sound, count slowly, focus on calming and pleasant images, or concentrate on external stimuli. Although this technique is short-term in nature, it gives the depressed you time to establish some degree of control over your thinking. To practice this technique, set aside 10 to 15 minutes twice a day, sit comfortably, close your eyes, and relax. (See Example 17 in the Appendix.) Exercise: For the negative thoughts you listed in the previous exercise, try focusing on something neutral or pleasant to interrupt the thoughts. Each time you iii 106 become aware that you have drifted back to your negative thoughts, simply refocus back to your replacement thoughts or image. You will do this again and again. __________________________ Refocus __________________________ Refocus __________________________ Refocus __________________________ Refocus __________________________ Refocus __________________________ Refocus __________________________ Refocus __________________________ Refocus __________________________ Refocus __________________________ Refocus The Automatic Thought Record The Thought Record presented in this chapter (see Figures 7.1 and 7.2) is one of the most widely used methods in therapy for helping change thinking patterns and levels of emotional distress. It is well worth spending time on and practicing the use of this method. It is not learned immediately. Take time to collect information about distressing situations between sessions and write them down. You can apply your understanding of the cognitive distortions and the cognitive therapy techniques using this format in your responses to automatic thoughts. Following are some basic ground rules for transcribing your experience onto the Thought Record. Situation This is a neutral description of what you are experiencing as you find yourself feeling emotional distress. It is \"just the facts\" and not a time to editorialize. Describe what you are doing and/or where you are while you are feeling bad. Emotions These are the feeling(s) you are experiencing during the situation you described. A feeling is usually a word or two (i.e., anxious, sad, afraid, angry, etc.), not a description of how, what, or why. Your therapist can help you if you have 107 difficulty identifying exactly what you feel. Often people confuse thoughts and feelings. The feeling is associated with the previous column (your situation) and the next column (your automatic thought). You should rate the intensity of your feelings on a scale of 1-100%, wth 1% representing no distress and 100% representing the most intense feelings you have ever felt. Automatic Thoughts This is the thought(s) that are going through your mind associated with the feeling(s) you reported in the previous column. You should also rate your belief in these thoughts on a scale of 1-100%, with 1% representing no belief and 100% representing a great amount of belief in these thoughts. Adaptive Thoughts These are your responses to the automatic thoughts. They involve the principles you have just read about in the section on cognitive therapy techniques. You should also rate your belief in these adaptive thoughts on a scale of 1-100%, with 1% representing no belief and 100% representing a great amount of belief. Following are some other rules of thumb when you use this method. 1. Address only one automatic thought at a time. If you have several automatic thoughts associated with the feeling, chose the one that seems the strongest. You can go back to the others later, if the distress you are feeling is still very strong. 2. Try to come up with at least three adaptive thought responses for each automatic thought. They should be specific and contain evidence (preferably from your life and experience) to dispute or offer alternatives to the content of the automatic thought. If the thought is a realistic problem, problem-solving skill building can be a part of the contents you write in this column. 3. Use descriptive rather than judgmental or value-laden language. Be compassionate to yourself about what you are feeling and move away from being self-punitive. Identify any language distortions, like \"should,\" \"have to,\" \"must,\" IIalways,\" and \"never,\\' Examples ofAdaptive Thoughts Last time I missed a deadline, no one was that upset because they knew I put in a good effort.

(80%) 108 Outcome Here you describe what happened as a result of your actions and re-rate your feelings and thoughts. You should also add any new feelings or thoughts you may have about what is affecting you. It is recommended that you photocopy the blank Thought Record (see Figure 7.1) and use it when you have distressing feelings. (See Figure 7.2 for a completed example.) Figure 7.3 presents a chart for you to list when you practiced the techniques listed in this chapter. You may want to photocopy it so you can record your practice over a period of weeks. 109 ... ...

How can cognitive rehearsal help with a personal problem? 113  Final Words of Hope Will Depression Come Back? So now you are feeling somewhat better. You may ask yourself, \"Will the depression come back?\" Evidence suggests that the answer is \"Perhaps.\" For some people who have a serious problem of low mood, a single episode is all they experience. Other people experience a recurrence of their low mood after a period of normal mood. The important point is that now you are better prepared because you have a number of ways to reduce the severity of depression and limit how long it lasts. Even if low mood returns, it can have less effect on your life. Am I Finished? A second question you may ask yourself is \"Am I finished?\" You may be saying, \"Now that I am less depressed, I never have to work at dealing with my mood.\" That would be like saying, \"Now that I have lost 5 pounds, I\\'m going to eat a gallon of ice cream.\" What is more likely is that you have recovered from a period of low mood and are getting back on track with your life. Just like any other skill, practicing what you have learned to monitor and confront low mood is important. The exercises that you have gone through in this program are not \"used up.\" You should continue to use them to maximize the quality of your life, and they must be practiced periodically. You have to give yourself a maintenance contract for your life. Using your emotion and mood skills regularly does not mean that you remain in \"therapy\" or \"counseling\" for the rest of your life, any more than learning how to play tennis means you work with a coach for the rest of your life. However, maintaining your realistic and positive mood is important. Many of the skills you have mastered are now incorporated into your everyday life. They can also help you in two very important ways in the days and weeks to come. You can use the skills you have mastered in this program to better 115 II monitor your day-to-day mood and the thoughts and circumstances that accompany them. This habit will help you identify potential problems early. Early identification of abnormally low mood can offer you the opportunity to help yourself in another important way. Byrationally challenging your dysfunctional thoughts, you may catch low mood early and prevent it from worsening. Therefore, the combination of your early warning skills in discovering a potential problem and your self-help skills in directly confronting the issue of low mood can help you maintain the achievements of these past weeks. Case Examples Sara Sara was a student who was depressed and had many negative thoughts about herself and the future. She habitually thought and acted in ways that maintained her depression, similar to those you have read about in this workbook. She participated in therapy, and her mood improved significantly in about 4 months. However, when she announced that she thought she had \"conquered\" her depression and that she was determined never to feel this way again, she needed a little more work to gain perspective on what she had accomplished. Sara appeared to have inadvertently applied the distortion of all-or-nothlng thinking to her improved condition. Odd as it may seem, distortions or biases in thinking apply to feeling good, too! This is why a transition process occurs in therapy when a therapist and client discuss what improvement was made with cognitive therapy, and what to expect in the future. Sara\\'stherapist asked her about the flip side of low self-confidence, which is overconfidence. Too little or too much confidence seldom serves people well. The tendency to overstate can become an exaggeration of reality. When she reflected on what she had been through, Sara recognized that her depression was very powerful and not necessarily a condition she knew everything about. Her therapist agreed and confided that he, too, did not know all there was to know about this common emotional problem. Cognitive therapists are discovering new ways to help their clients all the time. It is important that neither therapists nor clients become too confident that they know everything about the complexities of mood and affect. We have developed significant methods to recover from \"depression. If you used this program well, you are better prepared for future depressive episodes but not invulnerable. Your improvement means that your strength and defenses have gotten better through your effort. If you had decided to improve your physical condition by joining a fitness center, you might exercise several times a week, get a personal trainer, and focus on strengthening your weaknesses. Let\\'s say you changed your appearance and became lean and limber. If you really like your accomplishments, you would be ill advised to stop all exercise and go back to your old routine. If a person wants to stay in shape physically and emotionally, it requires maintenance and effort. Many people experience some relapse in maintaining II 116 themselves in good shape either physically or mentally. If you are aware of this human tendency to fall back to old habits and routines, you are more likely to approach such problems pragmatically and without condemnation. Then, the possibilities of reapplying the techniques that work for improvement increase. John With therapy, John successfully improved his mood a couple of years ago. However, the depression came back. This time, he was so disgusted with himself that he was almost dragged into treatment by his brother. He told his therapist he was ashamed that he was back in the same poor shape that he was in so long ago. An area he had difficulty with in his first effort in therapy was self-compassion. He tended to be critical and perfectionistic, and when he was depressed, he judged himself harshly. It became easier for him to reapply methods of cognitive therapy once he acknowledged that he did not do well when criticized by others. Also, he had more difficulty dealing with problems when he was overcritical in his own self-talk. His second round of therapy was even more successful than the first. This is not an uncommon story. One aspect of successfully managing depression is recognizing when our prevention and maintenance efforts are weakening. In such instances, it may be necessary to schedule a booster session with your therapist. Consultations such as these can reinforce skills previously learned in therapy as well as enhance them. One Last Story About the Future If you have dealt with some significant problems in your life while in therapy, you know these aren\\'t the last problems you will have. You may have come to treatment as a result of losing a job or starting a new one. You may have had a love relationship end badly or perhaps in divorce. You could have made a mistake in judgment and have done things to disappoint others and yourself. There are no certificates, credentials, special knowledge, or passes that allow you to graduate into a stress-free existence without ever experiencing problems and disappointments again. Discouragement, success, and even boredom in the future are all possibilities in parts of your life. Sometimes fortune cookies, motivational speakers, and psychic friends provide the vague promises of solving almost all your problems now and forever. The authors have found that such promises are unrealistic and misleading. Probably the most reasonable assurance your therapist can provide is that you are better prepared to navigate through life so that you might appreciate the good events and deal adequately when things go wrong. Your therapy is skill-building in solving problems, accepting yourself, and finding compassion for others and for yourself. It takes practice and discipline. There is no pill, perfect shield or piece of advice that gives a human being an immunity from the difficulties of life. However, you may come to know more about the relativity of what can bring a sense of well-being. As Shakespeare wrote in Hamlet, \"there is nothing either good or bad but thinking makes it so\" (Hamlet, Act II, Scene II). 117 When It Comes Bade All moods are temporary. You now have more options on how to handle depression than you did before you started reading this workbook and trying the cognitive therapy methods. It is important to expect that some things will get you down. When they do, use these methods again. Your success with this program is not over just because you might be feeling better. It is because you understand the methods and can use them again and again. This is because life\\'s ups and downs are practically a certainty. If you can improve your mood just a bit, you are making progress. If the problems continue, get a booster session or even a few additional sessions with a cognitive therapist in your area. The following parable (1997 Pete Seeger, used with permission) may help us reflect on the pursuit of creating meaning in our lives (Seeger &\" Blood, 1997): Once there was a king who had three sons, and he wanted to give them a good education. He called in his wise men. He said, til want you to boil down all the world\\'s wisdom into one book; I\\'ll give it to my sons and have them memorize it.\" It took them a year; they came back with a volume bound in leather, trimmed in gold. The king leafed through it. \"Hrn, very good.\" He turns to his sons. \"Learn it!\" Now he turned to the wise men. He said, \"You did such a good job with that, see if you can boil down all the world\\'s wisdom into one sentence.\" It took them five years. They came back and bowed low. \"Your majesty, the sentence is \\'This too shall pass.?\\' The king didn\\'t like that so well. He said, \"See if you can boil down all the world\\'s wisdom into one word.\" It took them ten years. When they came back, their beards were draping on the ground. They bowed low. \"Your majesty! The word is, (pause) \\'Maybe.\\'\\'\\' Maybe cognitive therapy has helped you. There is a lot of reason to have confidence in the methods described in this workbook and in yourself. You don\\'t know what good (or bad) events await you. With effort applied in meaningful ways, you can have a better life. This applies to anyone. These methods do work. The authors\\' colleagues all around the world have conducted scientific outcome studies that over and over again show how the ideas and methods described in this workbook are effective with improving affect and mood for people who suffer with depression. Cognitive therapy may be one of the most researched set of successful methods for getting people relief from depression that currently exists! It\\'s up to you to make use of the techniques and ideas in this book. Are you wanting and willing to try? We hope so.   Nearly everyone has occasional sleepless nights. Stress, anxiety, alcohol, and caffeine are just some ofthe things than can contribute to problems with sleep. Certain medical conditions and psychological disorders can also contribute to irregular sleep patterns. If you are experiencing sleep problems, and think you may have insomnia, this book can help. What Is Insomnia? Insomnia is a common sleep disorder that consists of frequent nighttime sleep difficulties that result in reduced functioning during the daytime. People with insomnia experience persistent difficulties sleeping despite allowing themselves adequate time to sleep and having a comfortable bedroom setting. Insomnia is a very common problem that may be short-lived and temporary, intermittent, or fairly persistent over time. Over one third of the adult population experiences insomnia at least intermittently, whereas 10% to 15% suffer chronic, unrelenting sleep difficulties. Common symptoms of insomnia include: II Difficulty falling asleep at night II Waking up during the night II Waking up too early II Having sleep that is poor in quality II Daytime fatigue or sleepiness 1 Concentration, attention, or memory problems Daytime irritability Worries about sleep difficulties or daytime symptoms Causes of Insomnia As mentioned, there are numerous causes of insomnia. Stress is a primary contributor to the development of sleeping problems. Concerns about work, school, health, or family can keep your mind too active, making you unable to relax. In the same way, anxiety can often cause disruptions in sleep. Ifyou are experiencing severeanxiety, you may have an anxiety disorder that should be dealt with before you try to tackle your sleep problems. The same is true if you are suffering from depression. In these cases, you should consult a qualified mental health professional. Insomnia can also be caused by a variety of medical conditions, particularly those that cause physical pain like fibromyalgia and arthritis. If you are currently being treated for a medical or psychological condition, your doctor or therapist may have prescribed medication for you. Prescription drugs, including some antidepressants, high blood pressure medications, and corticosteroid medications, can interfere with sleep. Many overthe- counter (OTC) medications, including some pain medication combinations, decongestants, and weight-loss products, contain caffeine and other stimulants. Talk to your treatment provider about this possibility. Diagnosing Insomnia There are several ways to diagnose insomnia. Ifyou are using this workbook in conjunction with visits to a qualified health care provider, whether it is your medical doctor or a mental health professional, he or she may ask you to complete various questionnaires and self-rating instruments. Your health care provider may also request to interview your bed partner in order to obtain more detailed information about your sleep patterns. Depending on your symptoms, you may also be asked to complete an overnight evaluation at a sleep center. This son of evaluation is rarely needed to diagnose insomnia but sometimes is 2 required to rule out other types ofsleep disorders. If you undergo such an evaluation, a team of people at the center will monitor and record a variety of your body activities during the night, including brain waves, breathing, heart rate, and eye and body movements. If you are planning to use this workbook independently, without the guidance of a health care provider, you may benefit by first conducting a brief self-administered assessment of your symptoms. As a first step, consider the description of insomnia and the list ofinsomnia symptoms presented on the previous pages of this workbook. Does that description and list ofsymptoms fit you? If it does, you very well may have the type of problem that can be helped by the strategies described in this workbook. However, it is important to rule out the presence of certain medical conditions and sleep disorders that would require a different or additional form of treatment. To do so, we suggest you ask yourself the following groups of questions: Group 1 I. Have you been told that you snore loudly? 2. Do you sometimes awaken gasping for breath? 3. Have you been told that you stop breathing during your sleep? 4. Axeyou so sleepy in the daytime that you often tend to fall asleep when you are seated or become inactive? ). When you wake up in the morning do you still tend to feel tired and unrestedr 6. Do you often have a headache or dry mouth when you awaken in the morning? Group 2 I. Do you often have an urge to move your legs? 2. Is the urge to move your legs accompanied by an annoying sensation such as crawling, tingling, drawing, or general restlessness in your legs? 3 3. Do the symptoms described in questions I and 2 go away briefly if you move your legs or walk? 4. Do the symptoms in your legs get worse when you are at rest? 5. Do you tend to have the urge to move your legs or restless sensations more so in the late afternoon or evening hours? 6. Do your restless symptoms make it difficult for you to fall asleep or stay asleep at night? Group 3 I. Do you have a medical condition such as arthritis, fibromyalgia, or a recent injury that causes you pain? 2. Does the pain from this condition make it difficult for you to get to sleep at night or does it awaken you in the middle of the night? 3. If your pain would go away, do you think that your sleep problem would be dramatically reduced or perhaps even eliminated? Group 4 1. Do you feel sad, blue, or depressed much of the time? 2. Do you seem to have little energy and motivation to do what you need to do each day? 3. Have you lost interest in socializing or engaging in your hobbies? 4. Has your appetite changed or have you recently lost weight without trying [Q do so? 5. Do you often have times during which you just want to retreat to your bed? 6. Do you have periods of feeling unusually good or on top of the world for no reason? 7. Do have periods when you seem to have an extremely high amount of energy such that you lose your interest in or need for sleep for several days at a time? 4 8. Do you seem to worry about many things in addition to your sleep? 9. Do you feel uptight, anxious, or stressed much of the time? 10. Do you tend to have palpitations, excessive sweating, or shortness of breath when you are put under pressure or become the center of attention in a social situation? Ifyou answered yes to one or more ofthe questions in any ofthese groups of questions, you may have a condition that would benefit by a medical or medication treatment instead of or in addition to the form of treatment provided in this manual. Those questions in Group I pertain to a sleep disorder known as sleep apnea, a disorder categorized by repeated pauses in breathing during sleep. Ifyou answered \"Yes\" to several of those questions you likely will benefit by consulting your health care provider and requesting a consultation with a sleep disorders specialist. Those questions in Group 2 pertain to a disorder know as restless legs syndrome, a neurological condition that is characterized by the irresistible urge to move the legs,which usually requires certain forms ofmedication as treatment. Those questions in Group 3 are obviously designed to help you determine if you have a painful medical condition that disrupts your sleep. The presence ofsuch a painful condition does not necessarily indicate that you won\\'t benefit from the strategies outlined in this workbook. However, your results are likely to be much better ifyou and your physician work together to ascertain treatments that most effectively reduce or relieve your pain. Finally, those questions in Group 4 are designed to help you determine if you have a mental or emotional health problem that would benefit from separate treatment attention. You should probably consult a mental health provider if you have positive answers to these questions, particularly if you answer yes to more than one. The list ofquestions presented is designed to assesssome ofthe more commonly encountered causes of sleep disturbance that benefit from treatments other than, or in addition to, those described in this workbook. Admittedly this question list is not exhaustive. Menopausal symptoms in women and prostate problems in men also commonly cause sleep difficulties and benefit from medical attention. In addition, many medications given for other medical problems may have insomnia as a side effect. Ifyou are taking any medications, you may want to ask your physician 5 Sleep Logs about these, particularly if your insomnia symptoms developed or worsened after you began taking the medicationfs) in question. Finally, dependence or abuse ofalcohol and many forms ofillicit drugs can disrupt sleep as well. Individuals with such problems may benefit from enrolling in a formal substance abuse treatment program. If you do not have any of the types of problems mentioned and generally answered \"no\" to the questions presented here, you are probably ready to begin an additional self-assessment specifically designed to help you better describe and quantify your sleep difficulty. Perhaps one of the best and most commonly used methods to assessand describe your sleep difficulty is by keeping records of your sleeping habits over an extended period of time. Such records not only help your health care provider in assessing your sleep difficulties, bur also may make you aware of important aspects ofyour sleep pattern that you have ignored. The following section provides more information on how to keep records of your sleep using sleep logs provided later in this workbook. Before starting any type of program to improve your sleep habits {either on your own or with the help of a qualified professional}, you should track your sleep pattern for a period of at least 2 weeks. Use the blank sleep logs provided at the end of this chapter to record detailed information about your sleep each night. Place the log at some convenient location and complete it each morning within the first 30 minutes or so after arising. The sleep log tracks the following information: whether you took any naps the previous day whether you used medication and/or alcohol to facilitate sleep the time you entered bed the time the lights were turned offand you attempted to fall asleep the number of minutes it took for you to fall asleep the number and length of awakenings during the night 6 the time of the final morning awakening the time you actually got out of bed the quality of the previous night\\'s sleep your level of restfulness upon awakening Since many of the questions contained in the sleeplog pertain to your sleep and wake time at night, you may be tempted to take special note of your alarm clock each time you awaken or even to keep some records on your nighrstand during the night. However, since such practices will likely alter or even worsen your insomnia problem, you should avoid giving in to such temptations. People with insomnia usually do surprisingly well in estimating their sleepand wakefulness on the morning followingeach night\\'s sleep. Thus, extra efforts to monitor your sleep during the night are not needed to produce a useful sleep log record. The information obtained from self-monitoring will give you (or your health care provider) more insight into your sleep problems. For example, after reviewing your sleep logs, it may become clear that you very rarely go to bed or wake up at the same time each day, and this observation indicates you have an erratic sleep schedule. Or, your sleep log may show that you often rely on medications or alcohol to help you fall asleep. Also, you may notice that you are spending far more time in bed than you usually sleep. We will discuss this in more detail in Chapter 3. Overview of the Program The program outlined in this book is based on the principles of Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT). You may work through this book on your own or in conjunction with visits to a qualified health care provider. If you decide to enroll in formal treatment with a clinician or therapist, he or she will want you to bring this workbook to each session. On average, it takes approximately 2 to 4 weeks for this program to produce noticeable effects. You will do much of the work on your own while your therapist guides you and answers any questions you may have. 7 Figure 1.1 shows the 3-P model of insomnia, which provides a framework for understanding the evolution of chronic insomnia and the role of CBT in managing this condition. According to this model, predisposing/actors, precipitating events, and perpetuating mechanisms allcontribute to the development ofchronic primary sleep difficulties. Some individuals may be particularly vulnerable to sleep difficulties, either because they have a \"weak\" or \"highly sensitive\" biological sleep system or they may have personality traits that dispose them to poor sleep when confronted with stress. When such individuals are confronted with the proper precipitating circumstances (e.g., a stressful life event, sudden unexpected change in their sleep schedule), they tend to develop an acute sleep disturbance. This sleep problem, in turn, may then be perpetuated by a host of psychological and behavioral factors that emerge in reaction to such sleep difficulty. Specifically, how people think about their sleep problem and the strategies they use to deal with it ofren make the insomnia problem persist over time. This program is designed to target the thoughts and beliefs you have about sleep and the sleep habits you developed that keep your insomnia going. You will learn to change your behavior, as well as how to manage any negative thoughts that may contribute to your disrupted sleep. Before you begin practicing the techniques in this book, however, you need to learn about sleep and how your body\\'s sleep system works.

Generally speaking, there is no one amount ofsleep that \"fits\" everyone. Most normal adults sleep 6 to 8 hours per night. However, some people need only 3 or 4 hours ofsleep each night, whereas others require 10 to 12 hours of sleep on a nightly basis. At this point, it is important to set aside any previous notions or beliefs you might have about your sleep needs. These beliefs may be wrong and may hinder your progress. In addition to getting rid of any old ideas you have about your sleep needs, it is important that you learn some things about how your body\\'s sleep system works. People, like many animals, have powerful internal \"clocks\" that affect their behavior and bodily functioning. The \"body clock\" works in roughly a 24-hout period and produces 24-hour cycles in such things as digestion, body temperature, and the sleep-wake pattern. For example, if we record a persons body temperature for several days in a row, we will see a consistent up and down pattern or rhythm in temperature across each 24-hour day. The temperature will be at its lowest point around 3 or 4 AM, will rise throughout the morning and early afternoon, and will hit its peak around 3 or 4 PM. Then, once again the temperature will begin to fall until it hits its low point in the early morning hours. The influence of the internal circadian clock on the sleep-wake cycle is apparent if one studies the relationship between the body\\'s 24-hour temperature rhythm and the timing of the sleep period. Suppose a person is placed in a place like a cave, away from daylight, external clocks, and all other time-of-day indicators. In this situation, the person will continue to show a consistent temperature rhythm and sleep-wake pattern that 11 complete a full cycle about every 24 hours. In most people, there is a close relationship between the temperature cycle and the sleep-wake pattern they show. This relationship is illustrated by the graph shown on page 13. As shown by this graph, the main sleep period begins when the body temperature is falling and later ends after the body temperature begins rising again. Hence, although the za-hour temperature cycle shown does not control the human sleep-wake pattern, the temperature rhythm reflects the working of the body clock and can be used to predict when sleep is likely to occur in the za-hour day. In the real world, work schedules, meal times, and other activities work together with our body clocks to help us keep a stable sleep-wake pattern. However, significant changes in our sleep-wake schedule can interfere with our ability to sleep normally. This may be caused by what is often called \"jet lag.\" If, for example, a man who lives in New York flies to Los Angeles, he initially is likely to have some difficulty with his sleep and to experience some daytime fatigue once he arrives in California. This occurs because the 3-hour time zone change places his new desired sleep-wake schedule at odds with his \"body clock\" that is \"stuck\" in his old time zone. This situation is shown in Figure 2.2. on page 14. The man\\'s body clock remains on New York time and initially lags behind the real world clock time in California. This traveler is likely to become sleepy 3 hours earlier than he wishes and to wake up 3 hours before he prefers on the initial days of his trip. Fortunately, with repeated exposure to the light-dark pattern in the new time zone, the body clock resets and allows the traveler to \"get in sync\" with the new time zone, However, this traveler is again likely to experience temporary problems with his sleep and daytime fatigue when he first returns to New York. Inaddition to our body clock, getting older usually leads to changes in our sleep. As we age, we tend to spend more time awake in bed and less time in the deepest parts of sleep. Because sleep becomes more \"shallow\" and broken as we age, we may notice a decrease in the quality of our sleep as we grow older. Although these changes set the stage for the development of sleep problems, they do not guarantee such problems. However, because of these changes, it is probably unrealistic to expect 12 _ Circadian Temperature Rhythm c o \"- \".:: ~ ~ ~ \"@ Q) 0..

Finally, before attempting to change your sleep habits, it is important that you understand the effects of sleep loss on you. This understanding is important because many who have sleep problems make these problems worse by what they do to make up for lost sleep. For example, people may take daytime naps, go to bed too early, or \"sleep in\" following a poor night\\'s sleep in order to avoid or recover lost sleep. Although these habits seem logical and sensible, they all may serve to continue the sleep problems. In fact, these habits are usually the opposite of what needs to be done to improve sleep. In some respects, losing sleep one night may lead to getting more or better sleep the following night. In fact, the drive to sleep gets stronger the longer one is awake before attempting to sleep again. For example, a person is much more likely to sleep for a long time after being awake for 16 hours in a row than after being awake for only 2 hours. It is important to remain awake through each day in order to build up enough sleep drive to produce a full night\\'s sleep. Extended periods of sleep loss, of course, may have some bad effects as well. If people are totally deprived of a night\\'s sleep, they usually become very sleepy, have some trouble concentrating, and generally feel somewhat irritable. However, they typically can continue most normal daytime activities even after a night without any sleep at all. When allowed to sleep after a longer than normal period of being awake, most people will tend to sleep longer and more deeply than they typically do on a normal night. Although people tend not to recover all of the sleep time they lost, they do typically recover the deep sleep they lost during longer than usual periods without sleep. Hence, your body\\'s sleep system has some ability to make up for times when you don\\'t get the amount of sleep you need. Since you have kept a sleep log for a couple of weeks, you have probably noticed that you occasionally had a relativelygood night\\'s sleep after one or several nights of poor sleep. Such a pattern suggests that your body\\'s sleep system has an ability to make up for some of the sleep loss you experience over time. Although your sleep is not normal, you can 15 take some comfort in this observation. The important point to remember is that you do not need to worry a great deal about lost sleep nor should you actively try to recover lost sleep. Needless worry and attempts to recover lost sleep will only worsen your sleep problem. This information is not intended to \"make light\" ofyour sleep problem. You do indeed have a sleep problem that needs to be treated and the strategies in this book can help. The next chapter provides important information about how to change your behavior in order to improve sleep. 16 Improving lOur Sleep ~ \" i ~ 2 ;\\' [ 1 11111111111 Persistent insomnia is a bothersome and often disruptive condition that reduces quality of life and one\\'s sense ofwell-being. It also can adversely affect mood, reduce performance at work, and increase risk for injury during routine tasks (e.g., driving) that require normal alertness. Given these considerations, it is no wonder that many, if not most, individuals who suffer from persistent insomnia develop some sorts of strategies to cope with sleep difficulties and minimize their impact on their daily routines. Since insomnia usually results in erratic and unpredictable sleep, people with insomnia often assume they should try to sleep whenever they have the opportunity to do so. For example, insomnia sufferersmay \"sleep in\" following a poor night\\'s sleep, or they may nap in the daytime to recover sleep they feel they lost after a bad night. Some individuals may even schedule extended times in bed at night so they have sufficient time remaining for the sleep even if they spend a good portion of the night awake in bed. Others may lie in bed awake for hours trying hard to sleep only to become increasingly frustrated as the hours pass by. Whereas these strategies may appear sensible, reasonable, or understandable for someone suffering from insomnia, all of these practices may play an active role in sustaining ongoing sleep problems. In fact, your sleep habits as well as your general attitude and approach toward sleep play crucial and deciding roles in determining how well or poorly you sleep most nights. As noted in the previous chapter, consistent, good quality sleep occurs when there is a strong sleep drive and a consistent sleep-wake schedule in place. Habits that reduce sleep drive (e.g., daytime napping) or lead to variation in one\\'s sleep schedule (e.g., sleeping in on weekends) lead to disrupted sleep. Also, practices like 17 going to bed when you are still feeling stimulated and alert or lying in bed for extended periods trying to \"force sleep\" only cause frustration and arousal that make sleep difficult, if not impossible. Thus, your sleep habits and approach toward sleep will be a central and initial focus of this treatment program. In order to conquer your insomnia, you need to follow a regimen designed to reduce bedtime arousal, increase your sleep drive, and stabilize your sleep schedule so that your body\\'s sleep system can work at its best without inference from you. Asa first step toward achieving this goal, you need to make sure that you are sufficiently relaxed and ready for bed when you choose to retire each night. To enhance the chances of being ready for sleep when you enter bed, you should try to build in some time to relax in some way prior to bed so that you establish a \"buffer\" between your active day and your more passive sleep process. For example, it is a good idea to engage in activities such as light, recreational reading, listening to soothing music, or watching TV that you find enjoyable and relaxing during the hour or two just prior to bed. During this buffer time, avoid mentally or physically stimulating activities that could increase your alertness. Activities such as intense studying for an exam, trying to solve a perplexing problem, or engaging in physical exercise just prior to bed usually make sleep much more difficult to initiate. Hence, activities such as these should be avoided just before bed so you have the opportunity to wind-down sufficiently from your day and prepare properly for sleeping. In addition to preparing for bed in a proper manner, it will likely be helpful, if not crucial, rhar you follow a set ofwell-tested guidelines that have proven highly effectivein treating chronic insomnia problems. The following discussion describes the sleep improvement strategies you should implement and explains why each of these strategies is important for improving your sleep. Sleep Improvement Guidelines I. Select a standardrising time It is important that you choose a standard rising time and stick to it every day regardless of how much sleep you actually get on any 18 given night. This practice will help you develop a more stable sleep pattern. As discussed in the previous chapter, changes in your sleep-wake schedule can disturb your sleep. In fact, you can create the type of sleep problem that occurs in jet lag by varying your wake-up time from day to day. If you set your alarm for a standard wake-up time, you will soon notice that you usually will become sleepy at about the right time each evening to allow you to the sleep you need. 2. Use the bed onlyfor sleeping While in bed, you should avoid doing things that you do when you are awake. Do not read, watch TV; eat, study, use the phone, or do other things that require you to be awake while you are in bed. If you frequently use your bed for activities other than sleep, you are unintentionally training yourself to stay awake in bed. If you avoid these activities while in bed, your bed will eventually become a place where it is easy to go to sleep and stay asleep. Sexual activity is the only exception to this rule. 3. Get out ofbed whenyou can\\'tsleep Never stay in bed, either at the beginning of the night or during the middle of the night, for extended periods without being asleep. Long periods of being awake in bed usually lead to tossing and turning, becoming frustrated, or worrying about not sleeping.These reactions, in turn, make it more difficult to fall asleep. Also, if you lie in bed awake for long periods, you are training yourself to be awake in bed. When sleep does not come on or return quickly, it is best to get up, go to another room, and only return to bed when you feel sleepyenough to fall asleepquickly.Generally speaking, you should get up if you find yourselfawake fur 20 minutes or so and you do not feelas though you are about to go to sleep. 4. Don\\'t worry, plan, orproblem solve in bed Do not worry, mull over your problems, plan future events, or do other thinking while in bed. These activities are bad mental habits. If your mind seems to be racing or you can\\'t seem to shut off your thoughts, get up and go to another room until you can return to bed without this thinking inrerrupring your sleep. If this disruptive thinking occurs frequently, you may find it helpful to routinely set 19 aside a time early each evening to do the thinking, problem solving, and planning you need to do. If you start this practice you probably will have fewer intrusive thoughts while you are in bed. 5. Avoid daytime napping You should avoid all daytime napping. Sleeping during the day partially satisfies your sleep needs and, thus, will weaken your sleep drive at night. 6. Avoid excessive time in bed In general, you should go to bed when you feel sleepy. However, you should not go to bed so early that you find yourself spending far more time in bed each night than you need for sleep. Spending too much time in bed results in a velYbroken night\\'s sleep. If you spend too much time in bed, you may actually make your sleep problem worse. The following discussion will help you to decide the amount oftime to spend in bed and what times you should go to bed at night and get out of bed in the morning. Determining Time in Bed (liB) It is important that you allot enough time for sleep each night but not too much time. The amount of time you schedule for yourself in bed each night should fit your own individual sleep needs. As noted in the previous chapter, sleep needs vary considerably from one individual to the next. Some people are very long sleepers whereas others need relatively little sleep to function effectivelyeach day. In that sense, sleep needs are very much like shoe sizes in that no one size fits everyone. As a result, there is no single amount of time that should be allotted for each night\\'s sleep. However, as a general rule the amount of time you schedule in bed each night should be fashioned to fit your individual sleep needs. In order to determine how much time you should stay in bed, you will need to review your completed sleep logs from the last two weeks (see Chapter I). If you are working with a therapist or clinician, he or she will help you with this process. If you are working through your sleep problems on your own, you will find the following instructions helpful. 20 First, calculate your average total sleep time (ATST) by checking your sleep logs and figuring out how much time you actually spend asleep each night. Do not take into account the many minutes you spend tossing and turning or staring at the ceiling. We are talking about actual time spent asleep here. Then, use the following formula to determine the ideal amount of time you should remain in bed each night. TIme in Bed (TIB) = Average Total SleepTime (ATST) + 30 minutes Look at the sample sleep log shown in Figure 3.1. on page 2.2.. In this example, the person slept 400 minutes per night, on average, but had an average time in bed of 540 minutes or 9 hours per night. This person\\'s ATST falls between 6:\"; and 7 hours, which at first glance seems normal for an adult. However, there is a big difference between this average total sleep time (6Yz-7 hours) and average time in bed (9 hours). Using the TIB formula, this person\\'s ideal time in bed is 430 minutes or 7 hours and 10 minutes. Of course, depending on preference, this individual could adjust the TIB down to 7 hours or up to 7Yz. Once you have calculated your ideal TIB, use it to choose a standard wake-up time and earliest bedtime. For example, if you decide that you want to get up each morning at 7 AM, but your recommended TIB equals 6 hours, this means that your earliest bedtime would be 1 AM. For some people a sleep schedule with a 1 AM bedtime and 7 AM rising time may seem ideal. Others may decide it is probably not a good idea to go to bed this late. There is room for flexibility, however. Earlier schedules that include an II PM bedtime and 5 AM rising time or a 12. AM bedtime and 6 AM rising time could be considered instead. Whatever the exact TIB you derive from your sleep log calculations, use your discretion when selecting the bed and rising times that fit with this amount ofTIB. Once you have identified the schedule that seems most acceptable to you, record it in the spaces provided on page 2.3. It is very important that you try to stick to these times as closely and as consistently as possible. This is an important step toward overcoming your . . msornma. 21 NI NI Day of the Week Mon Tve.

Once you have done so for a minimum of 2 weeks, you should examine how well you are sleeping at night and how tired or alert you are feeling in the daytime. If you are sleeping well most nights and are as alert as you would like to be in the daytime, then you probably don\\'t need to make changes to your TIB. However, if you find you are sleeping well at night, but feeling tired most days, you should try increasing your time in bed (TIB) at night by 15 minutes. For example, if you begin with 7 hours in bed per night the first 2 weeks and find that you are tired in the daytime despite sleeping soundly at night, you should try spending 7 hours and 15 minutes in bed each night during the subsequent 2 weeks. Ifyou continue to sleep soundly at night but still feel tired in the daytime, you can add another 15 minutes to the time in bed during the third z-week period and so on. However, when you notice an increase in the amount of time you are awake in bed each night, you will know that you have increased your time in bed at night too much. If this occurs, you should decrease your time in bed by 15 minutes per week until you find the amount of time that enables you to sleep soundly through the night and feel reasonably alert in the daytime. You should also decrease your time in bed after the first 2 weeks if the initial amount of time in bed chosen does not reduce your time awake in bed each night. 23 Sleep Hygiene To help you make decisions about changing your time in bed, it may be helpful to consider some simple guidelines. If you routinely take more than 30 minutes to fall asleep or you are routinely awake for more than 30 minutes during the night, you probably should reduce the amount of time you spend in bed each night. You also should consider decreasing your time in bed if you find that you routinely awaken more than 30 minutes before you plan to. Of course, the key word here is, \"routinely.\" Occasional nights during which you have a somewhat delayed start to your sleep or you have more wakefulness than usual once you get to sleep should not be viewed as reasons for changing your sleep schedule. Only when such occurrences are frequent or routine should you try a somewhat shorter time in bed. In the end, the best guideline to use is how you feel each day. If you are satisfied with how you generally feel in the daytime, you can assume that the sleep you are obtaining at night is sufficient. The sleep improvement guidelines discussed thus far are essential for correcting the sleep problems of many insomnia sufferers. For a sizablesubgroup of insomnia sufferers, these strategies are the only behavioral changes required to produce an improved sleep pattern. However, it sometimes is important to make changes in one\\'s general lifestyle and sleep environment to fully correct an insomnia problem. This is true since the sorts of daytime activities in which you engage, the foods and beverages you consume, and the surroundings in which you sleep may also all influence how well you sleep at night and how you feel in the daytime. In addition to making the specificchanges to your sleep habirs just discussed previously, you also may benefit from implementing the following lifestyle changes and alterations to your bedroom to promote a more normal sleep-wake pattern. I. Limit caffeine Caffeine is a stimulant that may make it harder for you to sleep well at night. You should also know that caffeine stays in your system for several hours after you consume it. Limit your caffeine to 24 the equivalent of no more than three cups of coffee per day and do not consume caffeine in the late afternoon or evening hours. 2. Limit alcohol Alcoholic beverages may make you drowsy and fall asleep more easily. However, alcohol also usually causes sleep to be much more broken and far less refreshing than normal. Try to avoid drinking alcohol in the evening or using it as a sleep aid. j. Exercise regularly but not close to bedtime Try some regular moderate exercise such as walking, swimming, or bike riding. Such exercise performed in the late afternoon or early evening may lead to deeper sleep at night. Also improving your fitness level, no matter when you choose to exercise will likely improve the quality of your sleep. However, as noted previously, avoid exercise right before bed because it may make it harder to get to sleep quickly. 4. Try a light bedtime snack such as milk, peanut butter, or cheese These foods contain chemicals that your body uses to produce sleep.As a result, this type of bedtime snack may actually bring on drowsiness. 5. Keep your bedroom quiet and dark Noise and even dim light may interrupt or shorten your sleep. You can block out unwanted noise by wearing earplugs, running a fan, or using a so-called \"white noise\" machine that is specifically designed to screen sleep-disruptive sounds. Also, if possible, eliminate the use of night-lights and consider using dark shades in your bedroom so that unwanted light does not awaken you too early in the morning. 6. Keep your bedroom cool Make sure the temperature In your bedroom is comfortable. Generally speaking, temperatures much above 75 degrees Fahrenheit cause unwanted wake-ups from sleep. During hot weather, use an air conditioner to control the temperature in your bedroom. 25 Summary This portion of the workbook reviewed important changes you can make in your sleep habits, sleep schedule, lifestyle, and bedroom to enhance your sleep pattern. It is important to understand that you should adhere to the strategies discussed consistently to get the best results. If you are able to do so, you should see some notable improvements in your sleep within a relatively short period of time-usually within 2-4 weeks. Moreover, if you are able to adopt the recommendations provided in this chapter as your general approach to sleep, you are likely to appreciate improvements that persist over time. In addition, you should be better equipped to address any future bouts of insomnia you may have. However, changes in sleep habits and lifestyle, while beneficial, may not fully address insomnia problems in everyone. For many insomnia sufferers, sleep worries and unhelpful sleep-related beliefs contribute significantly to insomnia. The following chapter discusses strategies especially designed to address these additional important contributors to daytime and nighttime insomnia symptoms. 26 Combating UnhelpfUl Thoughts 111111111111 Chapter 3 described the many ways you can alter your behavior in order to combat insomnia. This chapter talks about your thoughts and the role they may play in maintaining your sleep problems. It outlines strategies for managing these unhelpful thoughts so they no longer keep you awake at night. The Insomnia Brain Some people don\\'t even consider that how we think and how we feel can have a huge impact on how we sleep. It rums out that what and how we think affects how we sleep, how we feel, and how we deal with periods of sleep loss. Lots of research and conversations with insomnia patients have led us to conclude that there is a particular way of thinking associated with insomnia. We call it the \"Insomnia Brain\" because most people tell us that this way ofthinking is not typical ofhow they normally think, but since they have had insomnia, their type of thinking has changed and the way they view sleep has changed too. The Insomnia Brain tends to be very \"noisy\" and very focused on the effects of not sleeping. Negative thoughts in the Insomnia Brain spread like wildfire. You may find that although you don\\'t consider yourself to be a worrier, once you get into bed all you can do is worry. When this happens, it is likely that all your thoughts are negative and related to one another. For example, you may find yourself in bed on a Sunday night, worrying about work and a project you have due. This can lead you to worry that ifyou don\\'t get the project done, then you will lose your job. If you lose your job, you will get evicted from your apartment because you won\\'t be able to 27 Constructive Worry pay the rent, and so on. All of this negative thinking keeps your brain awake, making it virtually impossible for you to fall asleep. The more this happens in your bed on a nightly basis, the more likely it is to continue to happen. This is because it becomes an unintentional and unwanted habit. The good news is that all habits can be broken if you have a good strategy. Do you tend to get upset about not sleeping or worry about whether or not you will be able to manage during the day? Many people with insomnia will say, \"I wasn\\'t worried at all today but as soon as my head hit the pillow, it was like a switch went off\" Does this ever happen to you? It means that your bed has become a signal for worry and upset. There are ways to change this signal. Refer back to Chapter 3 and the recommendation to get out of bed and leave the room when you cannot sleep. One of the most effective strategies for quieting an active mind is to leave the bedroom when you start to experience troubling thoughts. This will break the habit. It may take several attempts at first, but your brain will eventually get the picture that your bed is not the place for it to be active. This practice may have other benefits too. Taking the Insomnia Brain out of bed results in becoming more clear-headed and being better able to switch off your troublesome thinking. You can return to the bed when you are no longer worrying or problem solving. Some people are concerned that getting out of bed will limit their opportunity for sleep, but the chance of sleeping while your brain is active is limited. Getting this type of mental activity under control by spending a few minutes out of bed will increase your chances of being able to sleep. While most people find that getting Out of the bed is enough to address their nighttime worry problem, some continue to worry. Some bedtime worries are a result of keeping so busy during the day that no time is available to deal with the worries. Sleep is the first opportunity that is quiet enough for your brain to try and complete its unfinished business. Could this be you? 28 Constructive Worry Instructions When we have problems, we tend to use our problem-solving skills to make our lives better and to relieve ourselves of anxiety. It is not surprising that some of us may use our problem-solving skills at the wrong time and place, namely bedtime. We may think about a problem, trying to solveit, but unfortunately, the anxiety caused by the problem will keep us awake. Constructive worry is a method for managing the tendency to worry during that quiet time when sleep is supposed to be taking over. Do this exercise during the early evening (at least 2 hours before bed). It should take you only about 15 minutes to complete. Here\\'show it is done: 1. Write down a problern(s) facing you that has the greatest chance of keeping you awake at bedtime, and list them in the \"Concerns\" column of the Constructive Worry Worksheet on page 32. 2. Then, think of the next step that might help fix it. Write it down in the \"Solutions\" column. This need not be the final solution to the problem, since most problems have to be solved by taking steps anyhow, and you will be doing this again tomorrow night and the night after until you finally get to the best solution. If you know how to fix the problem completely, then write that down. If you decide that this is not really a big problem, and you will just deal with it when the time comes, then write that down. If you decide that you simply do not know what to do about it, and need to ask someone to help you, write that down. If you decide that it is a problem, but there seems to be no good solution at all, and that you will just have to live with it, write that down, with a note to yourself that maybe sometime soon you or someone you speak with will give you a clue that will lead you to a solution. 3. Repeat this for any other concerns you may have. 4. Fold the Constructive Worry Worksheet in half and place it on the nightstand next to your bed and forget about it until bedtime. 29 (You may wish to photocopy the worksheet and then fill it out so you do not need to tear the page out of the book.) ). At bedtime, if you begin to worry actually tell yourself that you have dealt with your problems already in the best way you know how, and when you were at your problem-solving best. Remind yourself that you will be working on them again tomorrow evening and that nothing you can do while you are so tired can help you any more than what you have already done; more effort will only make matters worse. 6. An additional benefit of the constructive worry technique may be less anxiety during the daytime. Use the sample Constructive Worry Worksheet shown in Figure 4.1 as a guide when filling out your own. Additional blank copies ofthe worksheet can be found in the appendix at the back of the book. CONCERNS 1. \"fhe; ai.... c..ofldiTIOI\\'li~ i91\\'t worl::.i~ in ~ !-<l.... 2.Mon~!

Most beliefs about sleep boil down to a fear about whether we will be able to cope with the insomnia. It is common for people with insomnia to worry about whether they will lose control over their abilities to sleep, whether they will become sick as a result of the insomnia, and even whether they may \"go crazy\" if their insomnia persists. These worries can be very frightening, so it is often helpful to take a more critical look at the types ofbeliefs that lead to such distress. The Thought Record is a very simple, yet very powerful tool. It\\'s powerful because it curbs the Insomnia Brain\\'s tendency to be negative and consider only the worse-case scenarios of sleep loss. Balanced thoughts also challenge those beliefs that generate anxiety. Lastly, this tool will help you see that you are not powerless; that your efforts toward changing your sleep habits do produce improvements in your sleep, as well as your mood, and help to reduce daytime fatigue. Thought Record Instructions Using the blank Thought Record on page 35,think ofa time, perhaps even last night when you had strong feelings or upsetting thoughts related to your insomnia. What were you doing or where were you when you had these feelings or thoughts? Write them down in the \"Situation\" column of the record. What kind of mood or feelings were you experiencing? Write down your feelings in the \"Mood\" column. What are you thinking or what were you thinking when you began to feel this way? Are you concerned about how you will deal with another day with thisinsomnia? Are you predicting that you\\'ll never sleep? Write these thoughts down in the \"Thoughts\" column. Even if some of them seem to be untrue or silly, it is important to write them down. There are no wrong thoughts. The next step is to look at each of these thoughts and figure out why they seem to be so true. What is the evidence for these thoughts? Write 32 this down in the \"Evidence for the Thought\" column. Most people can remember a time when they had difficulty dealing with their insomnia. The Insomnia Brain remembers this as \"evidence\" that you can\\'t deal with insomnia. But this is probably not the whole story. It is important to look more critically at these beliefs, and one way to do this is to think about whether this thought is true 100% of the time. For example, you may focus on the one instance in which you performed poorly at work and discount the thousands of times you have performed well even though it was difficult. Or we overlook that there are small things that don\\'t support the thought. For example, we may forget that there have been times when we have felt good after a poor night\\'s sleep; or when we felt poorly after a good night\\'s sleep; or we jump to conclusions or focus on the worst possible outcome. Write all this evidence down in the \"Evidence against the Thought\" column. Examining the evidence against the belief forces the Insomnia Brain to focus on thoughts that are less anxiety provoking or less frustrating. The last step in this process is to consider both the evidence for and against the belief and think of a thought that lies somewhere in the middle. This thought should consider that there may be some part of the evidence for the belief that may be true, but it should take into consideration that there is plenty of evidence against the belief. For example, a balanced alternative to the thought, \\'Tm never going to make it through tomorrow\" is: \"I sometimes feel groggy at work after a poor night\\'s sleep, but not always, and I always seem to cope pretty well with it.\" Write this new thought down in the \\'\\'Adaptive/Coping Statement\" column. Most people tend to feel a little better after completing this exercise. Use the sample Thought Record shown in Figure 4.2 as a guide when filling out your own. Complete Thought Records on a daily basis or whenever you are bothered by a particular thought or feeling over the course of the next 2 weeks. Additional blank copies of the record can be found in the appendix at the back of the book. When you review your Thought Records you may notice that your thoughts typically fall into several categories. These thinking styles or thought patterns are described on pages 36-38. 33 ~ Figure 4.2 completed Thought Record Mood (Intensity Evidence forthe Evidence against Adaptive/Coping Do you feel any Situation 0-100%) Thoughts hought the thought statement dIfferently?

Common Insomnia Thoughts Misattribution: Because you have insomnia, you may attribute your negative thoughts or bad moods to the fact that you have problems sleeping, while discounting other possible causes. For example, it is normal to experience some grogginess for the first 30-60 minutes upon awakening. This is called sleep inertia and it does not necessarilymean that you had a poor night\\'s sleep that will lead to having a bad day. Similarly, it is normal to experience an increase in sleepiness and a decline in mental and emotional functioning in the early afternoon. This is a normal phenomenon called the \"post-lunch dip.\" It corresponds to a \"dip\" in one\\'s body temperature after lunch. It is not evidence that you are unable to function. Emotional reasoning: This is when you view your feelings as facts. Just because you have some anxious feelings during the day does not mean that you will be unable to sleep that night. This belief will only lead to further anxiety when sleep does not come and, in turn, will keep you awake even longer. All-or-none thinking: Lots ofpeople with insomnia say, \"I didn\\'t sleep at aU last night.\" This is highly unlikely. The odds that you were lying motionless in your bed for 8 hours straight are very small. Otherwise, you would be completely unable to function. You would be more than just a little groggy and fatigued the following day. If you find yourself thinking that you didn\\'t get any sleep on a particular night, reviewyour sleep logs in an effort to find \"the missing sleep.\" For example, did you miss any parts of the TV show you were watching that night? If so, you may have dozed off for a few minutes during the program. Self-Jit!fillingprophecy: This is when you predict that you will have a terrible day becauseyou had poor sleep the night before, and without knowing it, you approach the day in such a way that ensures you will, in fact, have a terrible day. There is tremendous power in the mind\\'s ability to create a realityconsistent with its beliefs. Catastrophizing: Have you ever thought about what you are specifically worried about when you worry about your sleep? Sometimes people are surprised to find what they are actually worrying about when they 36 worry about their sleep. For example, you may be worried that you will not be able to sleep tonight. Ask yourself, \"What if I don\\'t sleep tonight? What would be so bad about that?\" Actually answer this question. The answer may be, \"I\\'m worried that I won\\'t be able to get my job done.\" Again, ask yourself, \"What if I won\\'t be able to get my job done? What would be so bad about that?\" Continue to ask these questions until you discover the worst case scenario. When exploring the worst possible outcome, it may look like the following, \"I\\'m worried that I would get fired and then I wouldn\\'t be able to pay my mortgage, so I would lose my house, and then I would be homeless.... Many people with insomnia worry that they may become nonfunctional and unable to support themselves, or even that they might \"go crazy\" because of their sleep problem. Considering that this is what lurks beneath the surface worry of not sleeping, it is probably no wonder that it is difficult to sleep. In other words, there is so much riding on whether you might sleep (e.g., you might \"go crazy\" or become homeless) that it increases the pressure to sleep and makes insomnia almost inevitable. It helps to understand that this is the fear about not sleeping, and it is important to examine whether it is unhelpful to have this belief. In other words, it is important to consider the evidence that you will \"go crazy\" or will become homeless. Mind-reading: Some people with insomnia believe that others are \"noticing\" their poor performance. They may worry about this out of a fear of negative evaluation from others. This belief is often untrue because most people with insomnia function quite well. What tends to be different after a poor night\\'s sleep is the amount of extra effort required to do regular tasks. If you think that people are noticing that you are incompetent at work because of your insomnia, it can be helpful to explore whether this thought is true. Very likely, it\\'s not. Or at least it\\'s not true 100% of the time. Overgeneralization: This is when you put too much emphasis on a single event or incident. For example, you may think, \"I had trouble completing my crossword today, so I will be mentally useless at work.\" To combat this type of thinking, you need to see the range of evidence. People with insomnia tend to cope extraordinarily well 90% of the time. 37 Discounting the positive/Focusing exclusively on the negatives: There are often hundreds of instances of coping and good functioning within the day that are discounted in lieu ofone instance wherein functioning was lower. You may think your whole day was a waste simply because you forgot one appointment. Review the rest of your day and you will see that you accomplished all your tasks and attended to all your other responsibilities. Don\\'t focus on the one missed appointment. Instead, focus on how productive you were overall. Continued Monitoring Asyou continue working to correct your poor sleep habits, it is important that you also continue monitoring your sleep using sleep logs. We have provided additional copies in the appendix at the back ofthe book. Also, remember to complete the Constructive Worry Worksheet in the early evenings and the Thought Record whenever you are bothered by a particular thought or feeling. Use these tools to monitor your progress and to combat your unhelpful thinking styles. Seeing the progress you have made serves to motivate you to continue with the program and working to change your negative thoughts will help lessen your anxiety, which will undoubtedly lead to better sleep. 38 Troubleshooting 111111111111 Many who follow the recommendations in this workbook will experience notable sleep improvements in a relativelyshort period of time, usually within 2 to 4 weeks. If you fall in this group you should be sleeping soundly at night and no longer experiencing daytime sleepinessor other types of daytime impairment. If this describes you, you are well on your way to overcoming your insomnia. However, for many people with insomnia, the treatment program outlined in this workbook involves an entirely new way of thinking about and reacting to their sleep problems. Among some individuals with insomnia, old attitudes and habits may persist even though earnest efforts are being made to follow the types of suggestions provided in the previous chapters. Other individuals may encounter some unexpected difficulties when trying to implement certain aspects of the treatment program described. In either case, the benefits obtained from these strategies may fallshort of what is expected or desired and some additional corrective strategies are necessary to address these types ofproblems. If you have attempted to follow the sleep improvement strategies outlined in the previous chapters for several weeks and are not satisfied with your results, you may benefit by troubleshooting your overall approach. This chapter reviews common difficulties individuals encounter when implementing the treatment program described in previous chapters and provides troubleshooting advice for addressing such difficulties. Trouble Getting Up on Time Since your body clock is very important in regulating your sleep-wake pattern, it is important that you \"train\" your clock properly so it works for you and not against you. Your body clock can work in a predictable 39 and consistent fashion only if you follow a consistent sleep schedule that is reinforced by your adhering to a standard rising time. If you are not obtaining the results you desired from this program, perhaps it is because you continue to have too much day-to-day variability in your rising time. Take a look at the sleep logs you have been keeping and examine your rising times across each week. Are those times pretty consistent or do they vary by an hour or more across the week? If so, you probably will benefit by making extra efforts to be more consistent in your rising time. Some people have more difficulties than others establishing and adhering to a standard rising time. Some individuals report they sleep through the alarm from time to time, whereas others admit to hitting the snooze button repeatedly, particularly if they feel they have had a bad night\\'s sleep. For many individuals, the idea of having to get up at the same time on weekends as on workdays seems distasteful and unreasonable. These adherence difficulties and attitudes will only sustain an insomnia problem. Strategies such as using a loud alarm, placing it out of reach from your bed, enlisting the assistance of willing family or friends to make sure you are up at the rising time selected, and reminding yourself that consistency is what will make a difference in your sleep are all important strategies to consider to help you make sure you get up on time and consistently from day to day. If you do, you should wake up well rested on weekdays and weekends, so delaying your rising time will not seem useful. Trouble Avoiding Naps Whereas many insomnia sufferers understand that eliminating daytime naps will lead to better nighttime sleep, some have great difficulty avoiding such naps. Among some such individuals, such as those who are retired, it is difficult to avoid daytime napping particularly during the post-lunch dip occurring in the early PM. Also, it is not unusual for individuals to experience unintended napping or dozing particularly in the hours following the evening meal and prior to the target bedtime. Many who implement the strategies outlined in this workbook find they have 40 to reduce their time in bed dramatically, usually by delaying their chosen bedtimes. While trying to adhere to their new bedtimes, such individuals may have great difficultywarding off unintended sleep during the early evening hours. This is true particularly if these hours are spent reading, watching TV, or engaging in some other sedentary activity. If any significant amount of sleep occurs during these hours, it will likely notably detract from the subsequent night\\'s sleep. If the types of napping problems described here affectyou, strategies to avoid sleep during these hours are needed. Fortunately there are some relatively simple and effective methods for avoiding unintentional evening napping. During the time of year when daylight persists into the evening, taking a 20-30 minute walk outdoors after your evening meal may help your body clock adjust to the new delayed bedtime and help you minimize your early evening sleepiness. Also remember that being mentally and physically active reduces your level of current sleepiness. As such, avoiding sedentary and relaxing activities during the post-lunch dip and early evening may help you fend off unwanted dozing. Finally, if you have a family member or roommate who can help keep you awake and avoid unintended afternoon or evening dozing, take advantage of that person\\'s help. Stayirm in Bed When You Can\\'t Sleep One of the more difficult recommendations for many people to follow is that of getting out of bed whenever they are awake for extended periods. Perhaps it is winter and you have turned down the thermostat in your home for the night. You know it might be cold in the house so you avoid getting up even though you find yourself tossing and turning. You may tell yourself that if you just lie there long enough, you are bound to go to sleep. Or perhaps you tell yourself that although you are not sleeping, at least you are \"resting.\" Ofcourse, you know from your past experiences these are the thoughts and strategies on which you have been relying and they have not resolved your insomnia problems. Remember, the purpose of getting out of bed is to retrain yourself to sleep more soundly. It is important to avoid long periods of wakefulness 41 in bed wherein you are tossing and turning and finding that the bed is a tortuous and unpleasant place to be. Keep a robe handy on those nights that the house is cold so it is easier and lessaversiveto get out of bed when you are not sleeping. Also, realize that adhering to this strategy now will lead to more consolidated and rewarding sleep in the future and fewer extended awakenings in bed. Reminding yourself of this fact should help you adhere to this suggestion more consistently so you achieve your overall sleep goals. Trouble Getting Back to Sleep Some individuals claim that whenever they get out of bed at night, they have trouble getting sleepy again so they can return to bed and resume their night\\'s sleep. Many times this problem is not about the process of getting out of bed, but relates more to the types ofactivities in which the person engages after getting out of bed. Some people engage in physically (housecleaning) or mentally (balancing the checkbook) stimulating activities when they get up during nocturnal waking periods. Others may engage in sedentary yet attention-grabbing activities that lead them to delay their return to bed. Activities such as watching late-night provocative talk shows or reading that captivating mystery novel are common examples of this sort of activity. Generally speaking, activities that are sedentary, relaxing, and easyto stop when you feel sleepy are the best choices for occupying your out-of-bed time during unwanted nighttime waking periods. Lingering Daytime Fatigue Some people carefully implement the strategies described in the previous chapters and note they continued. to feel tired or fatigued. in the daytime despite having improved sleep at night. For some individuals this occurs because they are still running a \"sleep debt\" and could use more sleep time than they are currendy getting. If you find that you are sleeping much better but you are routinely awakened by your alarm, this is a sign you could sleep longer in the morning ifallowed to do so. Ifthis scenario 42 describes you, an upward adjustment in your TIB is needed. In increasing your TIB you are encouraged to follow the instructions presented on pages 20-24 in Chapter 3. In following these strategies, you should note that your goal is to achieve a sleep pattern wherein you routinely go to sleep quickly, sleep soundly through most nights, and routinely awaken feeling rested just prior to your alarm going off. Of course some people with insomnia achieve an optimal sleep pattern yet continue to feel very fatigued in the daytime. It is important to note that not all symptoms of daytime fatigue are the result of inadequate nighttime sleep. Often factors such as an overly busy lifestyle, excessive stress at work, and a lack ofsufficient personal time to relax and restore oneselfmentally may all contribute to marked levels of daytime fatigue. Hence, if your sleep has improved yet you continue to have significant daytime fatigue, you may need to consider other causes of this daytime symptom. Try building in some time to relax or engage in more recreation activities or stress-relieving exercises or pastimes to see if these sorts of activities provide you some benefit. If you generally feel much less fatigued during holiday periods or vacations, it may be a sign that stress reduction rather than further sleep improvements are what you need most. Changing Your Thoughts Changing your unhelpful thoughts about sleep requires practice. The Constructive Worry Worksheet in Chapter 4 is a helpful tool that you can use on a regular basis to resolveproblems before you go to sleep. Problem solving before bed makes it less likely that your worries will keep you awake at night. Ifyou are having trouble finding the time to complete this worksheet, it may be helpful to set aside a ry-minure block of time specificallyfor problem solving. Make this activity a priority. It will stop you from worrying when you should be sleeping. Practice completing this form on a nightly basis for a couple of weeks. Working out yout issues before bedtime will decreaseyour anxiety and worrisome thoughts, which may be major contributors to your sleep problems. 43 The Thought Record (also from Chapter 4) is yet another tool that is helpful in challenging negative thoughts that may serve to maintain your insomnia. Assuggested for the Constructive Worry Worksheet, \\'try to set aside a block of time for completing your Thought Record. Ideally, you should schedule a Thought Record around the same time each day. If you are having trouble completing some or all of the columns of the Thought Record, refer back to the example in Chapter 4. Use this sample as a guide when filling out your own record. Practice completing this form over the next severalweeks until you get the hang ofit. Enlisting the Help of a Professional If your sleep hasn\\'t improved and you aren\\'t making the progress you had hoped for, you may wish to seek the help of a qualified health care provider. Meeting with a mental health professional like a clinician or therapist is one option available to you. Scheduling an appointment with your primary care physician is another. Ifyou have tried these sorts of consultations and they do not provide the relief you desire, you may benefit by consulting a sleep specialist. Youcan find an accredited sleep specialty center that employs such professionalsby reviewingthe listings in your local yellow pages or by consulting the website of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (www.aasmnet.org). Within such centers, individuals who specialize in insomnia treatment or are trained in behavioral sleep medicine techniques are most likely to be able to assist you. If you consult such a professional, you may find that you will benefit from a therapist-guided version of the type of treatment outlined in this book. It also may be the case that you have an underlying and previously undetected sleep disorder such as sleep apnea that requires an alternate type of therapy. Whatever the case, for some individuals consulting a professional for assistance is what is needed to obtain the sleep improvements desired.     Rationale for Psychosocial Skills Training with Borderline Clients I Individuals meeting criteria for borderline personality disorder (BPD) are flooding mental health and clinical practitioners\\' offices. Even when potentially effective pharmacotherapy is instituted, it is commonly assumed that psychosocial treatment in some form is necessary for borderline clients. The psychosocial skills training outlined in this manual is based on a model of treatment called dialectical behavior therapy (DBT). DBT is a broad-based cognitive-behavioral treatment developed specifically for BPD. It was the first psychotherapy shown via controlled clinical trials to be effective with this disorder (Linehan, Armstrong, Suarez, Allmon, & Heard, 1991; Linehan & Heard, 1993; Linehan, Heard, & Armstrong, in press). Psychosocial skills training is one portion of the treatment; the form of DBT that has been shown to be effective with borderline clients is a combination of individual psychotherapy and skills training. DBT, including skills training, is based on a dialectical and biosocial theory of BPD. This chapter begins with a brief overview of the dialectical world view and the assumptions inherent in such a view. It then presents the biosocial theory of BPD and its development as well as the behavioral characteristics and dialectical dilemmas that are predicted from this theory. Understanding the treatment philosophy and theoretical underpinnings of DBT as a whole is critical for effective use of this manual. The philosophy and theory are important because they determine therapists\\' attitude toward both treatment and their clients. This attitude, in turn, is an important component of therapists\\' relationship with their clients. The therapeutic relationship is central to effective treatment with suicidal and borderline individuals. This manual is a companion to my more complete text on DBT, Cognitive- Behavioral Therapy for Borderline Personality Disorder, and these principles are discussed fully there. (Because I refer to that book very often throughout this manual, from here on I simply call it \"the text:\\') The scientific underpinnings and references for many of my statements and positions are fully documented in Chapter 1 through 3 of the text; thus, I do not review or cite them here again. World View and Basic Assumptions As its name suggests, DBT is based on a dialectical world view. \"Dialectics;\\' as applied to behavior therapy, has two meanings: that of the fundamental nature of reality, and that of persuasive dialogue and relationship. As a world view or philosophical position, dialectics forms the basis of DBT. Alternatively, as dialogue and relationship, dialectics refers to the treatment approach or strategies used by the therapist to effect change. These strategies are described in full in Chapter 7 of the text and are summarized in Chapter 5 of this manual. Dialectical perspectives on the nature of reality and human behavior share three primary characteristics, each of which is important in understanding BPD. First, much as dynamic systems perspectives do, dialectics stresses the fundamental interrelatedness or wholeness of reality. This means that a dialectical approach views analyses of individual parts of a system ~s of limited value per se unless the analysis clearly relates the part to the whole. Thus, dialectics directs our attention to the immediate and larger contexts of behavior, as well as to the interrelatedness of individual behavior patterns. With respect to skills training, a therapist must take into ac2 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER count first the interrelatedness of skills deficits. Learning one new set of skills is extremely difficult without learning other related skills simultaneously-a task that in itself is even more difficult. A dialectical view is also compatible with both contextual and feminist views of psychopathology. Learning psychosocial skills is particularly hard when a person\\'s immediate environment or larger culture do not support such learning. Thus, the individual must learn not only self-regulation skills, but also better skills for influencing her environment. (Because the majority of borderline clients are women, and because the clinical trials demonstrating DBT\\'s effectiveness were conducted with only women clients, I use the pronoun \"she\" and \"her\" throughout this manual to refer to a typical client. However, there is no reason to believe that the treatment would not be effective with men.) Second, reality is not seen as static, but is comprised of internal opposing forces (thesis and antithesis) out of whose synthesis evolves a new set of opposing forces. A very important dialectical idea is that all propositions contain with them their own oppositions. As Goldberg (1980, pp. 295-296) put it, \"1 assume that truth is paradoxical, that each article of wisdom contains within it its own contradictions, that truths stand side by side\" (emphasis Goldberg\\'s). Dialectics, in this sense, is compatible with psychodynamic conflict models of psychoRathology. Dichotomous and extreme thinking, behavior, and emotions, which are characteristic of BPD, are ~.iewed as dialectical failures. The individual is stuck in p~larities, unable to move to syntheses. With respect to p~ychosocial skills training, three of these polarities ma~ progress extremely difficult. The therapist must pay ~ttention to each and assist each client in moving tow~rd a workable synthesis. !The first of these polarities is the dialectic between the rileed for the client to accept herself as she is in the moment and the need for her to change. This particular dialectic is the most fundamental tension in any psychotherapy, and it must be negoriated skillfully by the thempist if change is to occur. The second is the tension between the clients\\' getting what she needs and losing what she needs if she becomes more competent. I once had a client in skills training who every week reported doing none of the behavioral homework assignments and insisted that the treatment was not working. When after 6 months I suggested that maybe this wasn\\'t the treatment for her, she reported that she had been trying the new skills all along and they had helped. However, she had not let me know about it because she was afraid that if she showed any improvement, 1would dismiss her from skills training. A third very important polarity as to do with the client\\'s maintaining personal integrity and validating her own views of her difficulties versus learning new skills that will help her emerge from her suffering. If the client gets better by learning new skills, she validates her point that the problem all along was that she was unable to help herself. She has not been trying to manipulate people, as others have accused. She is not motivated to hurt others, or lacking in motivation altogether. But the client\\'s learning new skills may also validate others\\' opinions: It may prove that they were right all along (and the client was wrong) -that the client was the problem, not the environment. Dialectics not only focuses the client\\'s attention on these polarities, but also suggests ways out of them. (Ways out are discussed in Chapter 7 of the text.) The third characteristic of dialectics is an assumption, following from the two above, that the fundamental nature of reality is change and process rather than content or structure. The most important implication here is that both the individual and the environment are undergoing continuous transition. Thus, therapy does not focus on maintaining a stable, consistent environment, but rather aims to help the client become comfortable with change. Within skills training itself, therapists must keep aware not only of how their clients are changing, but also of how both they themselves and the treatment they are applying are changing over time. Biosocial Theory of Borderline Personality Di50rder2 The main tenet of the biosocial theory is that the core disorder in BPD is emotion dysregulation. Emotion dysregulation is viewed as a joint outcome of biological disposition, environmental context, and the transaction between the two during development. The theory asserts that borderline individuals have difficulties in regulating several, if not all, emotions. This systemic dysregulation is produced by emotional vulnerability and by maladaptive and inadequate emotion modulation strategies. Emotional vulnerability is defined by these characteristics: (1) very high sensitivity to emotional stimuli, (2) very intense response to emotional stimuli, and (3) a slow return to emotional baseline once emotional arousal has occurred. Emotion modulation is the ability to (1) inhibit inappropriate behavior related to strong negative or positive emotions, (2) organize oneself for coordinated action in the service of an external goal (i.e., act in a way that is not mood-dependent when necessary), (3) self-soothe any physiological arousal that the strong emotion has induced, and (4) refocus attention in the presence of strong emotion. Emotion dysregulation in borderline individuals then is the combination of an emotional response system that is oversensitive and Rationale for Skills Training 3 overreactive with an inability to modulate the resulting strong emotions and actions associated with them. As a whole, the disposition to emotion dysregulation is biologically based (though not necessarily via heredity). A dysfunction in any part of the extremely complex human emotion regulation system can provide the biological basis for initial emotional vulnerability and subsequent difficulties in emotion modulation. Thus, the biological disposition may be different in different people, and it is not likely that we will ever find one biological abnormality that underlies all cases of BPD. The Role of the Invalidating Environment in Emotion Dysregulation The crucial developmental circumstance in producing the emotion dysregulation described above is the \"invalidating environment.\" Such an environment is particularly damaging for the child who begins life with high emotional vulnerability. In turn, the emotionally vulnerable and reactive individual elicits invalidation from an environment that might have otherwise been supportive. A defining characteristic of an invalidating environment is the tendency to respond erratically and inappropriately to private experience (e.g., beliefs, thoughts, feelings, sensations), and in particular to be insensitive to private experience that does not have public accompaniments. Invalidating environments also tend to respond in an extreme fashion (i.e., to overreact or underreact) to private experience that does have public accompaniments. Phenomenological, physiological, and cognitive components of emotions are prototypic private experiences that lead to invalidation in these settings. To clarify the invalidating environment\\'s contribution to borderline behavioral patterns, let us contrast it to environments that foster more adaptive emotion regulation skills. In the optimal family, public validation of private experience is given frequently. For example, when a child says she is thirsty, parents give her a drink (rather than saying, \"No, you\\'re not. You just had a drink\"). When a child cries, parents soothe or attempt to find out what is wrong (rather than saying, \"Stop being a crybaby!\"). When a child expresses anger or frustration, family members take it seriously (rather than dismissing it as unimportant). When the child says, \"I did my best;\\' the parent agrees (rather than saying, \"No, you didn\\'t\"). And so on. In the optimal family, the child\\'s preferences (e.g., for color of room, activities, or clothes) are taken into account; the child\\'s beliefs and thoughts are elicited and responded to seriously; and the child\\'s emotions are viewed as important communications. Successful communication of private experience in such a family is followed by changes in other family members\\' behavior that increase the probability that the child\\'s needs will be met and that decrease the probability of negative consequences. Parental responding that is attuned and nonaversive results in children who are better able to discriminate their own and others\\' emotions. By contrast, an invalidating family is problematic because people in it respond to the communication of preferences, thoughts, and emotions nonattuned with responses -specifically, with either nonresponsiveness or more extreme consequences than more sensitive, validating social environments. This leads to an intensification of the differences between an emotionally vulnerable child\\'s private experience and the experience the social environment actually supports and responds to. Persistent discrepancies between a child\\'s private experience and what others in the environment describe or respond to as her experience provide the fundamental learning environment necessary for many of the behavioral problems associated with BPD. In addition to early failures to respond optimally, an invalidating environment more generally emphasizes controlling emotional expressiveness, especially the expression of negative affect. Painful experiences are trivialized and attributed to negative traits such as lack of motivation, lack of discipline, and failure to adopt a positive attitude. Strong positive emotions and associated preferences may be attributed to traits such as lack of judgment and reflection or impulsivity. Other characteristics of the invalidating environment include restricting the demands a child may make upon the environment, discriminating against the child on the basis of gender or other arbitrary characteristics, and using punishment (from criticism up to physical and sexual abuse) to control behavior. The invalidating environment contributes to emotion dysregulation by failing to teach the child to label and modulate arousal, to tolerate distress, or to trust her own emotional responses as valid interpretations of events. It also actively teaches the child to invalidate her own experiences by making it necessary for her to scan the environment for cues about how to act and feel, and by oversimplifying the ease of solving life\\'s problems it fails to teach the child how to set realistic goals. Moreover, by punishing the expression of negative emotion and erratically reinforcing emotional communication only after escalation by the child, the family shapes an emotional expression style that vacillates between extreme inhibition and extreme disinhibition. In other words, the family\\'s usual response to emotion cuts off the communicative function of ordinary emotions. Emotional invalidation, particularly of negative emotions, is an interaction style characteristic of societies that put a premium on individualism, including individual self-control and individual achievement. Thus, .. SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER it is quite characteristic of Western culture in general. A certain amount of invalidation is, of course, necessary in raising a child and teaching self-control. Not all communications of emotions, preferences, or beliefs can be responded to in a positive fashion. The child who is highly emotional and who has difficulty controlling emotional behaviors will elicit from the environment (especially parents, but also friends and teachers) the greatest efforts to control the emotionality from the outside. Invalidation can be quite effective at temporarily inhibiting emotional expression. Invalidating environments, however, have different effects on different children. The emotion control strategies used in invalidating families may have little negative impact on, or may even be useful to, some children who are physiologically well equipped to regulate their emotions. However, such strategies are hypothesized to have a devastating impact on emotionally vulnerable children. It is this interaction of biology and environment that is thought to result in BPD. This transactional view of borderline development should not be used to diminish the importance of abusive environments in the etiology of BPD. One of the most traumatic invalidating experiences is childhood sexual abuse. Researchers have estimated that up to 75% of individuals with BPD have experienced some sort of sexual abuse in childhood. Histories of such abuse seem to distinguish borderline individuals from other outpatient diagnostic groups. This research strongly indicates childhood sexual abuse as an important factor in the development of BPD. It is unclear, however, whether the abuse in and of itself facilitates the development of borderline patterns, or whether the abuse and the development of the disorder both result from the extent of the familial dysfunction and invalidation. In other words, the history of victimization and the emotion regulation problems seen in borderline individuals may arise from the same set of developmental circumstances. Nevertheless, the high incidence of sexual abuse in individuals with BPD points to the possibility that this is a distinguishing precursor to the disorder. The Pathogenesis of Emotion Dysregulation Maccoby (1980) has argued that the inhibition of action is the basis for the organization of all behavior. The development of self-regulatory repertoires, especially the ability to inhibit and control affect, is one of the most important aspects of a child\\'s development. The ability to regulate the experience and expression of emotion is crucial because its absence leads to the disruption of behavior, especially goal-directed behavior and other prosocial behavior. Alternatively, strong emotion reorganizes or redirects behavior, preparing the individual for actions that compete with the nonemotionally or less emotionally driven behavioral repertoire. The behavioral characteristics of borderline individuals can be conceptualized as the effects of emotion dysregualtion and maladaptive emotion regulation strategies. Impulsive behavior and especially parasuicide can be thought of as maladaptive but highly effective emotion regulation strategies. For example, overdosing usually leads to long periods of sleep, which in turn reduce susceptibility to emotion dysregulation. Although the mechanism by which self-mutilation exerts affectregulating properties is not clear, it is very common for borderline individuals to report substantial relief from anxiety and other intense, negative emotional states following such acts. Suicidal behavior is also very effective in eliciting helping behaviors from the environment, which may be effective in avoiding or changing situations that elicit emotional pain. For example, suicidal behavior is generally the most effective way for a nonpsychotic individual to be admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit. Finally, engaging in a parasuicidal act (and its aftereffects if it becomes public) can reduce painful emotions by providing a compelling distraction. The inability to regulate emotional arousal also interferes with the development and maintenance of a sense of self. Generally, one\\'s sense of self is formed by observations of oneself and of others\\' reactions to one\\'s actions. Emotional consistency and predictability, across time and similar situations, are prerequisites of identity development. Unpredictable emotional lability leads to unpredictable behavior and cognitive inconsistency, and consequently interferes with identity development. The tendency of borderline individuals to inhibit or attempt to inhibit emotional responses may also contribute to an absence of a strong sense of identity. The numbness associated with inhibited affect is often experienced as emptiness, further contributing to an inadequate and at times completely absent sense of self. Similarly, if an individual\\'s sense of events is never \"correct\" or is unpredictably \"correet\\'~the situation in an invalidating environment-then the individual may be expected to develop an overdependence on others. Effective interpersonal relationships depend on both a stable sense of self and a capacity for spontaneity in emotional expression. Successful relationships also require a capacity to self-regulate emotions in appropriate ways and to tolerate some emotionally painful stimuli. Emotion regulation difficulties interfere with a stable sense of self and with normal emotional expression. Without such capabilities, it is understandable that borderline individuals develop chaotic relationships. These individuals\\' difficulties in controlling impulsive behaviors and expressions ofextreme negative emotions Rationale for Skills Training 5 wreak havoc in many ways with their relationships; in particular, difficulties with anger and anger expression preclude the maintenance of stable relationships. The Treatment Program DBT applies a broad array of cognitive and behavior therapy strategies to the problem of BPD, including suicidal behaviors. Like standard cognitive-behavioral therapy programs, DBT emphasizes ongoing assessment and data collection on current behaviors; clear and precise definition of treatment targets; and a collaborative working relationship between therapist and client, including attention to orienting the client to the therapy program and mutual commitment to treatment goals. Many components ofDBT-problem solving, exposure, skills training, contingency management, and cognitive modification -have been prominent in cognitive and behavior therapies for years. Stylistically, DBT blends a matter-of-fact, somewhat irreverent, and at times outrageous attitude about current and previous parasuicidal and other dysfunctional behaviors with therapist warmth, flexibility, responsiveness to the client, and strategic self-disclosure. The continuing efforts in DBT to \"reframe\" suicidal and other dysfunctional behaviors as part of the client\\'s learned problem-solving repertoire, and to focus therapy on active problem solving, are balanced by a corresponding emphasis on validating the client\\'s current emotional, cognitive, and behavioral responses just as they are. The problem-solving focus requires that the therapist address all problematic client behaviors (in and out of sessions) and therapy situations in a systematic manner, including conducting a collaborative behavioral analysis, formulating hypotheses about possible variables influencing the problem, generating possible changes (behavioral solutions), and trying out and evaluating the solutions. The attention to contingencies operating within the therapeutic environment requires the therapist to pay close attention to the reciprocal influence that therapist and client have on each other. Although natural contingencies are highlighted as a means of influencing client behavior, the therapist is not prohibited from using arbitrary reinforcers as well as aversive contingencies when the behavior in question is lethal or the behavior required of the client is not readily produced under ordinary therapeutic conditions. The tendency of borderline individuals to actively avoid threatening situations is a continuing focus of DBT. Both in-session and in vivo exposures to fear-eliciting stimuli are arranged and encouraged. The emphasis on cognitive modification is less systematic than in pure cognitive therapy, but none-the-Iess it is viewed as an important component both in ongoing behavioral analysis and in promoting change. The focus on validating the client\\'s thoughts, feelings, and actions requires that the DBT therapist search for the grain of wisdom or truth inherent in each client response and communicate that wisdom to the client. A belief in the client\\'s essential desire to grow and progress, as well as a belief in her inherent capability to change, underpins the treatment. Validation also involves frequent sympathetic acknowledgment of the client\\'s sense of emotional desperation. The whole of treatment emphasizes building and maintaining a positive, interpersonal, collaborative relationship between client and therapist. A major characteristic of the therapeutic relationship is that the primary role of the therapist is as consultant to the client, not consultant to other individuals. The therapist is consistently on the side of the client. Modifications of Cognitive and Behavior Therapies for Borderline Individuals Standard cognitive and behavior therapies were originally developed for individuals without serious personality disorders. Over the years, however, they have been applied increasingly to individuals who also have personality disorders, including BPD. The applications of cognitive-behavioral therapy to individuals with BPD has required some changes of emphasis and expansion of theoretical underpinnings. In DBT four areas are emphasized that, while not new, have not received as much attention in traditional cognitive-behavioral applications: (1) the emphasis on acceptance and validation of behavior as it is in the moment; (2) the emphasis on treating therapy-interfering behaviors of both client and therapist; (3) the emphasis on the therapeutic relationship as essential to the treatment; and (4) the emphasis on dialectic processes. First, DBT emphasizes acceptance of current behavior and reality more so than most cognitive and behavior therapies. To a great extent, in fact, standard cognitive-behavioral therapy can be thought of as a technology of change. It derives many of its techniques from the field of learning, which is the study of behavioral change through experience. In contrast, DBT emphasizes the importance of balancing the technology of change and a technology of acceptance. Although acceptance of clients as they are is crucial to any good therapy, DBT goes a step further than standard cognitive-behavioral therapy in emphasizing the necessity of teaching clients to fully accept themselves and their world as they are in the moment. The acceptance advocated is quite radical-it is not acceptance in order to create change. The focus on acceptance in DBT is an integration of Eastern psychological and spiritual practices 6 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER (primarily Zen practice) in Western approaches to treatment. The emphasis in DBT on therapy-interfering behaviors is more similar to the psychodynamic emphasis on \"transference\" behaviors and \"countertransference\" behaviors than to anything in standard cognitive-behavioral therapies. Generally behavior therapists have given little empirical attention to the treatment of client behaviors that interfere with the treatment. (The exceptions here are the large literature on treatment compliance behaviors, and the various approaches generally described under the rubric of \"shaping\"; the latter have received a fair amount of attention in the treatment of children, chronic psychiatric inpatients, and the mentally retarded.) This is not to say that the problem has been ignored completely. Patterson and his colleagues have even developed a measure of treatment resistance for use with families undergoing his behavioral family interventions (Chamberlain, Patterson, Reid, Kavanagh, & Forgatch, 1984; Patterson & FOl-gatch, 1985). Although the situation is beginning to change, almost no attention to date has been given to understanding therapist behaviors that interfere with effective cognitive-behavioral treatments. My emphasis on the therapeutic relationship as crucial to therapeutic progress in DBT comes primarily from my work in interventions with suicidal individuals. At times, it is only the relationship that keeps such a person alive. In psychosocial skills training, the relationship between client and therapist (and, in group settings, the relationship among clients) is also a powerful force in keeping the patient in the therapy. Borderline individuals are notorious for dropping out oftherapy early; thus, attention must be paid to factors that will enhance their attachment both to therapy and to life itself. Finally, the focus on dialectical processes sets DBT off from standard cognitive-behavioral therapy, but not as much as it appears at first glance. For example, contextual theories are very close to dialectical thinking. The emphasis in cognitive therapy on the interrelationships within the person between different types of behavior (e.g., the influence of cognitive behavior on emotional behavior) is also compatible with a dialectical perspective. Whether these differences between DBT and standard cognitive and behavior therapies are fundamentally important is, of course, an empirical question. Certainly, when all is said and done, the standard cognitive-behavioral components may be the ones primarily responsible for the effectiveness of DBT. Or, as cognitive and behavior therapies expand their scope, we may find that the differences between them and DBT are not as sharp as I suggest. Relationship Between Individual Psychotherapy and Skills Training DBT was developed from a model of BPD as a combination of motivation problems and capability deficits. First, according to the argument laid down above, borderline individuals lack important self-regulation, interpersonal, and distress tolerance skills. In particular, they are unable either to inhibit maladaptive mood-dependent behaviors or to initiate behaviors that are independent of current mood and necessary to meet long-range goals. Second, strong emotions and associated dysfunctional assumptions and beliefs learned in the original invalidating environment, together with continuing invalidating environments, form a motivational context that inhibits the use of behavioral skills the person does have and often reinforces inappropriate borderline behaviors. As my colleagues and I developed this treatment approach, however, it quickly became apparent that (1) psychosocial skills training to the extent we believe necessary is extraordinarily difficult if not impossible within the context of a therapy oriented to reducing the motivation to die and/or act in a borderline fashion; and (2) sufficient attention to motivational issues cannot be given in a treatment with the rigorous control of therapy agenda needed for skills training. From this was born the idea of splitting the therapy into two components: one that focuses primarily on psychosocial skills training and one that focuses primarily on motivational issues, including the motivation to stay alive, to replace borderline behaviors with skillful behavior, and to build a life worth living. Relationship of Borderline Behavioral Patterns to Skills Training The criteria for BPD as currently defined (see Chapter 1 of the text for a detailed discussion) reflect a pattern of behavioral, emotional, and cognitive instability and dysregulation. These difficulties can be summarized into five categories; in DBT four specific skills training modules are aimed directly at these five categories. First, as I have been discussing, borderline individuals generally experience dysregulation and lability of emotions. Emotional responses are reactive, and the individuals generally have problems with anger and anger expression as well as with episodic depression, anxiety, and irritability. One DBT skills training module aims to teach emotion regulation skills. Second, borderline individuals often experience interpersonal dysregulation. Their relationships are usually chaotic, intense, and marked with difficulties. Despite this, borderline individuals often find it extremely hard to let go of relationships; instead, they may engage in Rationale for Skills Training 7 intense and frantic efforts to keep significant individuals from leaving them. More so than most, borderline individuals seem to do well when in stable, positive relationships and to do poorly when riot in stable relationships. Thus, another DBT skills training module aims to teach interpersonal effectiveness skills. Third, borderline individuals have patterns of behavioral dysregulation, as evidenced by extreme and problematic impulsive behaviors as well as by attempts to injure, mutilate, or kill themselves. Impulsive and suicidal behaviors are viewed in DBT as maladaptive problem-solving behaviors resulting from an individual\\'s inability to tolerate emotional distress long enough to pursue potentially more effective solutions. Therefore, one DBT skills training module aims to teach distress tolerance skills. Fourth, dysregulation of the sense of self is common. It is not unusual for a borderline individual to report having no sense of a self at all, feeling empty, and not knowing who she is. And fifth, brief, nonpsychotic cognitive disturbances (including depersonalization, dissociation, and delusions) are at times brought on by stressful situations and usually clear up when the stress is ameliorated. To address both types of dysregulation, one DBT skills training module aims to teach a core set of\"mindfulness\"skills-thatis,skillshavingtodowith the ability to consciously experience and observe oneself and surrounding events. A Look Ahead In the next four chapters I discuss practical aspects of skills training; session format and starting skills training; the applications of DBT structural strategies and skills training procedures to formal skills training; and the application of other DBT strategies and procedures to skills training. Together, these chapters set the stage for deciding how to conduct skills training in a particular clinic or practice. The following five chapters offer specific guidelines on how to teach the behavioral skills that together make up the formal skills training component of DBT. I should note here that although we do conduct individual skills training in my clinic, all such training in our clinical trials were conducted in groups. Many of the treatment guidelines in this manual assume that skills training is being conducted in groups, mainly because it is easier to adapt group skills training techniques to work with individual clients than vice versa. (The issue of group versus individual skills training is discussed at some length in the next chapter.) Notes 1. Psychotherapists usually use either the word \"patient\\' or the word \"client\" to refer to an individual receiving psychotherapy. In this manual, I use the term \"client\" consistently; in the companion text, I use the term \"patient.\" A reasonable case can be made for using either term. The case for using the term \"client\" can be found in the definition of the term given by the Original Oxford English Dictionary on Compact Disc 1987: \\'\\'A person who employs the services of a professional or business man or woman in any branch of business, or for whom the latter acts in a professional capacity; a customer:\\' The emphasis here is on the professional nature of the relationship and services offered (skills training), rather than on the presumed \"illness\" of the person receiving services. Other, lesscommonuses oftheterm-sucha\"Onewhoisunderthe protection or patronage of another, a dependent\" (as in \"client state\"), or \\'\\'An adherent or follower of a master\\'~are less applicable, as they do not fully convey the independent status accorded the client in DBT skills training. 2. The ideas in this section are drawn not only from the text but from Linehan and Koerner (1992), which is a condensed discussion of the biosocial theory of BPD. 2 Practical Issues in Psychosocial Skills Training R.chosoaal skills training is necessary when solutions to an individual\\'s problems and attainment ofher desired goals require behavioral skills not currently in her behavioral repertoire. That is, under ideal circumstances (where behavior is not interfered with by fears, conflicting motives, unrealistic beliefs, etc.), the individual cannot generate or produce the behaviors required. The term \"skills\" in DBT is used synonymously with \"ability,\" and includes in its broadest sense cognitive, emotional, and overt behavioral (or action) skills together with their integration, which is necessary for effective performance. Effectiveness is gauged by both direct and indirect effects of the behavior. Effective performance can be defined as those behaviors that lead to a maximum of positive outcomes with a minimum of negative outcomes. Thus, \"skills\" is used in the sense of \"using skillful means;\\' as well as in the sense of responding to situations adaptively or effectively. The emphasis on integration of behaviors to produce a skillful response is important. Very often (indeed, usually), an individual has the component behaviors of a skills but cannot put them together coherently when necessary. For example, an interpersonally skillful response requires putting together words the person already knows into effective sentences, together with appropriate body language, intonation, eye contact, and so forth. The parts are rarely new; the combination, however, often is. In the terminology of DBT, almost any desired behavior can be thought of as a skill. Thus, coping actively and effectively with problems and avoiding maladaptive or ineffective responses are both considered using one\\'s skills. The central aim of DBT as a whole is to replace ineffective, maladaptive, or nonskilled behavior with skillful responses. The aim of DBT skills training is to help the individual acquire the needed skills. Individual versus Group Skills Training Successful psychosocial skills training requires discipline by both client and therapist. In skills training, the therapy agenda is set by the skills to be learned. In typical psychotherapy and in DBT individual psychotherapy, by contrast, the agenda is usually set by the current problems of the client. When current problems are pressing, staying with a skills training agenda requires the therapist to take a very active role, controlling the direction and focus of the session. Most therapists are not trained to take such a directive role; and thus, despite their good intentions, their efforts at skills training often peter out as clients\\' problems escalate. Even therapists who are well trained in directive treatment strategies have great difficulty keeping to a directive agenda when treating borderline clients. The inevitable crises and low emotional pain tolerance of such clients constitute a major and continuing problem. It is difficult for the clients, and consequently for their therapists, to attend to anything but the current crises during treatment sessions. For some clients even daily sessions would not solve the problem, since they often seem to be in an unrelenting state of crisis. It is particUlarly difficult to stay focused on skills when a client threatens to commit suicide if her current pain is not taken seriously. Taking it seriously usually means forgoing the day\\'s skills training agenda in favor of resolving the current crisis. Other clients may be less demanding of therapist 8 Practical Issues in Skills Training 9 time and energy, but their passivity, hopelessness, and/or lack of interest in skills training may pose a formidable roadblock. It is easy in such a case for the therapist to get worn out with the client and just give up the effort, especially if the therapist is not a firm believer in skills training anyway. Skills training can also be relatively boring for therapists, especially for those who have done considerable skills training with other clients. It is like doing the same operation over and over and over. Clients\\' fluctuating moods from week to week and within the therapy session (a characteristic of borderline individuals), together with therapists\\' wavering interest, can create havoc with the best-laid skills training plans. Inadequate attention to the actual teaching of behavioral skills, and the resulting therapy drift, are particularly likely in individual as opposed to group skills training. First, in individual therapy there is often nothing outside of the two participants to keep therapy on track. If both client and therapist want to switch to something else, they can do it easily. By contrast, in group therapy other clients-or at least therapists\\' sense of obligation to other clients-keeps therapists on track, even when one client wants to change track. Second, when one client in group skills training is not in the mood for learning skills, others may be. The reinforcement these other clients give the therapist for continu-. ing skills training can be more powerful than the punishment delivered by the client who is not in the mood. The crux of the problem is this: Skills training with a borderline individual is often not immediately reinforcing for either her or her therapist. There is rarely a sense of immediate relief. Nor is psychosocial skills training as interesting as having \"heart-to-hearts;\\' a topic I have discussed in Chapter 12 of the text. Skills training requires much more active work for both client and therapist. Thus, for individual skills training to work, special precautions must be made for arranging events so that both therapist and client will find it reinforcing enough to continue. Much of the development of DBT was influenced by the dual task of finding a treatment that would be effective in helping borderline individuals and a treatment that therapists could actually apply on a day-today basis. As I have noted in Chapter 1 of this manual, the difficulties of conducting skills training within the context of individual psychotherapy led me to split the treatment into components, with the acquisition of skills as the goal of one treatment component and getting the client to use the skills in place of maladaptive behaviors as the goal of another component (i.e., individual psychotherapy). Put in the vernacular, skills training tries to cram the skills into the person and individual psychotherapy tries to pull them out. For the reasons discussed above, the standard mode of skills training in DBT is group therapy. A number of circumstances, however, may make it preferable or necessary to conduct skills training with an individual client rather than in a group. In a private practice setting or a small clinic, there may not be more than one client needing skills training at anyone time, or a therapist may not be able to organize more than one person at a time for skills training. Some clients are not appropriate for groups. Although in my experience this is very rare, a client who cannot inhibit overt hostile behavior toward other group members should not be put into a group until this behavior is under control. Some clients may have already participated in 1 or more years of a skills training group but need further focused attention to one category or set of skills. Finally, a client may not be able to attend the offered group sessions. Individual Skills Training Again, focused skills training on an individual basis with a borderline client requires enormous self-discipline and perseverance on the part of the therapist. On the client\\'s side, the major roadblocks are her attempts to divert a skills training session to other, more pressing topics, or her refusal or inability to participate in skills training the therapist is attempting to provide. On the therapist\\'s side, tpe major roadblocks are discomfort with active, directive interventions, or the therapist\\'s lack of interest, boredom, or inability to provide the skills guidance that the cUent is begging for. Treatment in these cases can easily become a power struggle between the client and therapist. I{the therapist of the client who disrupts skills training can hold out, and maintain his or her focus on the client\\'s long-term needs over the short term needs, I think that individual skills training can work. Such a focus, however, is very difficult to maintain in the face of what are often genuine life crises. As for the therapist roadblocks, the intent of this manual is to generate some interest (and even some enthusiasm) in the therapist who is uninterested, and to provide guidelines and advice for the therapist who feels unable to offer skills training. Even for an interested skillful therapist, however, skills training with borderline clients is difficult. As I have noted in the text, trying to conduct skills training with a borderline individual is like trying to teach a person how to put up a tent in the middle of a hurricane. Nonetheless, it is also the case that if the client had more effective skills in her repertoire, she would be able to cope much better with crisis situations. And this is the dilemma: How does the therapist teach the skills necessary to cope, when the client\\'s current inability to cope is so great that she is not receptive to acquiring new behavioral responses? One solution is for the therapist simply to make continuous efforts to incorporate the 10 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER skills training procedures in every session. A problem with this approach is that it is often not apparent to the client in individual therapy what contingencies are operating at any given time in a session; the rules are not clear. The client who wants to focus on an immediate solution to an immediate crisis, therefore, has no guidelines as to when insisting on such attention is appropriate and likely to be reinforced and when it is not. A problem for the therapist is that it is extremely difficult to remain on track. My own inability to do just this was one of the important factors in the development of DBT as it is today. A second alternative is to have a second therapist or behavioral technician do individual skills training with each client. The rules for client and therapist behavior in this case are clear. In this format, general behavioral skills are learned with the skills trainer; crises, including the application of skills learned to particular crisis situations, are the focus of individual psychotherapy. This approach seems especially advantageous in certain situations. For example, in our university clinic a number of students are eager to obtain experience in working with individuals who meet criteria for BPD but are not able to commit to longer-term individual therapy. Conducting focused skills training is a good opportunity for these students, and, in my experience, has worked out well for the clients. It would be as easy in any setting where psychiatric residents, social workers or psychiatric nurses are in training. In a group clinical practice, therapists may conduct skills training for each other; a large practice may hire some therapists with specific talents in this area. The treatment model here is somewhat similar to a general practitioner\\'s sending a client to a specialist for specialized treatment. The difference in DBT is that routine (possibly weekly) meetings between individual psychotherapists and skills trainers are probably essential to the success of psychosocial skills training for borderline clients. I discuss this point further below. An individual therapist who has no one to refer a client to for skills training, or who wants to do it himself or herself, should make the context of skills training different from that of usual psychotherapy. For example, a separate weekly meeting devoted specifically to skills training may be scheduled. If possible, the session should be conducted in a room different from that used for individual psychotherapy. Other possibilities include switching chairs; moving a table or desk near (or between) the therapist and the client to put your skills training materials on; using a blackboard; turning up the lighting; having skills training sessions at a different time of day than psychotherapy sessions, or for a shorter or longer time period; arranging to audiotape or videotape the sessions if this is not done in individual psychotherapy, or vice versa; and billing differently. For a therapist with a particularly difficult client, participation in a supervision/consultation group is important in keeping up motivation and focusing on skills. Group Skills Training I have already mentioned a number of disadvantages to individual skills training. The chief disadvantage not yet mentioned is that it is inefficient. Even though in our experience borderline clients almost never want to join a group at the beginning, group treatment has much to offer over and above what any individual therapy can offer. First, therapists have an opportunity to observe and work with interpersonal behaviors that show up in peer relationships but may only rarely occur in individual therapy sessions. Second, clients have an opportunity to interact with other people like themselves, and the resulting validation and development of a support group are, in my opinion, very therapeutic. Third, clients have an opportunity to learn from one another thus increasing avenues of therapeutic input. Fourth, groups typically reduce the intensity of the personal relationship between individual clients and the group psychotherapist; in dynamic terms, the transference is diluted. This can be very important, because the intensity of therapy sometimes creates more problems than it solves for borderline clients. Finally, skills groups offer a relatively nonthreatening opportunity for individual clients to learn how to be in a group. This can be very important for two reasons. First, people in general, as well as borderline individuals, have to be able to function well in groups. Second, in our treatment program further supportive process groups are offered. These groups not only are very therapeutic when combined with individual psychotherapy, but also offer a long-term treatment that may be more dependable and economical than long-term individual therapy. In my psychotherapy research program, all clients in individual therapy also participate in group skills training. This requirement is made clear to each client at the initial screening meeting. In my own clinical practice, I may refuse to work individually with clients who are unwilling to participate in group skills training if I believe that their skills deficits are such that individual psychotherapy will be severely hampered without the addition of skills training. Indeed, one of the reasons (among many others) for the focus in DBT on building a strong, positive interpersonal relationship with a client in individual therapy is that the therapist will be able to persuade her to participate in group skills training even when she very much does not want to. In our research program, initial resistance to group skills training has been more the rule than the exception. A group can include as few as two people. In our Practical Issues in Skills Training II clinic, with very dysfunctional clients, we try to have six to eight persons in each group. A number of issues are particularly important in group therapy; I discuss many of these throughout the book. (You can, of course, simply ignore them if you are conducting individual skills training.) Open versus Closed Groups In open groups, new members can enter on a continuing basis. In closed groups, a group is formed and stays together for a certain time period; new members are not allowed once the group composition is stable. Whether a group is open or closed will often depend on pragmatic issues. In many clinical settings, especially inpatient units, open groups are a necessity. In outpatient settings, however, it may be possible to round up a number of people who want skills training and who will agree to stay together for a period of time. If a choice is available, which type of group works better? I have tried both types of groups and believe that open groups work better for skills training, although closed groups may work as well or better for subsequent supportive process therapy groups. Why? There are two reasons. First, in an open group clients have an opportunity to learn to cope with change in a relatively stable environment. Borderline individuals often have enormous difficulty with change; they may also have difficulties with trust. They may implore the therapists to keep the group stable and unchanging. However, keeping the group open, with somewhat controlled but continual change, allows therapeutic exposure to change in a context where clients can be helped to respond to it effectively. I once asked a client how she felt about new members\\' occasionally entering an open group and older members\\' leaving. She responded that she figured I had arranged it that way so she could practice her distress tolerance skills. After running a closed group for a year, where we tried to provide constancy and stability, I was shocked to learn that we could not make even minor changes in starting a second year without intense resistance on the part of group members. For example, we tried to move the table around which members sat, and ended up in a 3-week power struggle (until I gave in and agreed to keep the table). Second, in a closed group it becomes progressively easier to deviate from the skills training agenda. Process issues frequently become more prominent as members get more comfortable with one another. The gre...;, as a whole can begin to drift away from a rigorous focus on learning behavioral skills. Although process issues are obviously important and cannot be ignored, there is a definite difference between a behavioral skills training group and an interpersonal process group. The supportive process groups in DBT follow the skills groups; they are not offered until after an individual has gone through all of the skills training. Periodically adding new skills training group members, who expect to learn new behavioral skills, forces the group to get back on task. Treatment Module Cycles Four skills training modules have been developed for DBT: {I} core mindfulness skills, (2) interpersonal effectiveness skills, (3) emotion regulation skills, and (4) distress tolerance skills. The rationale for focusing on these particular skills has been discussed briefly in Chapter 1 of this manual and more extensively in Chapter 5 of the text. General group format and therapy strategies and procedures, as well as specific content for each module, are presented in later chapters. The interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance modules can be covered in 8 weeks (if training stays focused). Core mindfulness skills can be covered in two to three sessions, and then are reviewed and expanded upon further at the beginning of each of the other modules. Clients in my clinic generally stay in psychosocial skills training for at least 1 year. This means that each client goes through each eight week module twice. Because mindfulness skills are reviewed at the beginning of each module and are woven through each of the other three modules, the skills taught here are covered many times over the year. Some clients in our clinic have participated for more than 1 year, although usually clients \"graduate\" to more advanced groups after going through each module twice. A well-functioning client might profitably graduate from skills training after 6 months. A number of psychiatric inpatient units are presently using DBT. One long-term psychiatric hospital accepts clients for a 6-month structured treatment program. Clients go through each skills module once; they can also review the videotaped sessions as often as they wish. The modules can then be repeated as necessary in outpatient therapy. Day treatment settings may offer several modules concurrently, with clients attending more than one at a time. Short-term, acute inpatient units, may offer just one or two of the modules. For example, a number of such units offer a package combining mindfulness and distress tolerance skills. Other units have taken a few skills from each module and constructed a shortened version of DBT skills training. As these examples indicate, the treatment modules lend themselves to mixing and matching to suit particular needs and treatment philosophies. All other things being equal, however, I would suggest teaching straight from the manual a few times 12 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER before beginning to change and modify the skills treatment. Massed versus Spaced Practice Although each training module is designed to take 8 weeks to cover, up to a year could be spent on each. The content for each skills area is comprehensive and complex for such a short period of time. Covering the skills training material in this brief number of weeks requires very strict time management. Therapists also have to be willing to go on even when some (or even all) clients have not acquired the skills that are currently being taught. Clients are often overwhelmed with the amount of information the first time they go through each module. So why not expand each module to one 16-week module (massed practice) rather than two 8-week modules (spaced practice)? There are several reasons for the present format. First, borderline individuals are variable in their mood and functionality. They often go through periods of several weeks where they may miss meetings or, when present, pay attention minimally (if at all). Presenting material twice increases the probability that each person will be present, both physically and psychologically, at least once when a particular segment is covered. Second, different clients have different needs; thus, the modules are differentially relevant and preferred by various individuals. Having to sit though a disliked module for 16 weeks is very difficult. Sitting though 8 weeks of a disliked module is also hard, but not as hard. Third, in a 16-week format, the modules scheduled second and third get less practice time than in an 8-week format. If I could make a case that one module is indeed the most important and needs the most practice, this would not be a liability. However, I have no controlled empirical data to use in choosing which module that would be. In addition, it is doubtful that one module would be best for all clients. The central premise of a skills-oriented behavioral therapy is that acquisition of behavioral skills requires extensive practice. Even though the material often feels overwhelming the first time when presented in the 8-week format, clients nonetheless seem able to practice the skills in their everyday lives. Thus, presenting each module once during the first 6 months of treatment leaves a minimum of 6 months for continued practice before skill training ends. Fourth, going over the material after having had a chance to practice the skills for several months can be beneficiaL The material makes more sense. And it offers the chance for the clients to learn that problems that seem really hard at one point may not always seem so hard if they persevere in their attempts to overcome them. Finally, my experience has been that when 16 weeks are allotted to cover a treatment module, it is far easier to divert therapy time to attending to individual clients\\' crises and process issues. Although some attention must be given to these issues, it is easy to drift out of skills training and toward supportive process therapy, when time is not of the essence. In my experience, once this has happened, it is extremely difficult to get back control of the therapy agenda. Even though I see several advantages for the 8-week format, there is no a priori reason for it. And moving so quickly through each module depends on very close coordination with each client\\'s individual therapist (when this person is not a skills trainer). Again, in DBT it is the task of the individual psychotherapy to help the client use the new behaviors she is learning in the everyday situations where they are needed, including crises. The individual psychotherapy is also charged with analyzing motivational problems that interfere with replacing maladaptive behaviors with the DBT behavioral skills. Ordering of Modules At this writing, there are no empirical data to suggest how to order the modules. Since the core mindfulness skills are woven throughout each of the three. training modules, mindfulness obviously has to be the first module presented. In our current program, the interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, and distress tolerance modules follow, in that order. The rationale for this is based on the increasing abstractness of the skills and principles over the three modules. In addition, the three modules in this order can be viewed as decreasing in their degree of validation of a client\\'s sense of emotional pain. The interpersonal effectiveness module is presented as teaching skills in changing pain-producing environments. The situation is so pain-producing that it has to be changed. The emotion regulation module assumes that even though the situation may be generating pain, the individual\\'s response is so painful that it also has to change, and can be changed. The distress tolerance module assumes that even though there may be a lot of pain, it can be tolerated, and life can be accepted and lived in spite of pain. Surely, this is a difficult lesson for anyone, especially for our clients. One can, however, make a reasonably good case for any order of modules. In my own clinic now (some other centers do the same), we give clients the \"Crisis Survival Strategies\" handout (part of the distress tolerance module) during the first meeting with the client. These skills are more or less selfexplanatory, and many clients find them extremely helpful. We then go over them in detail when we teach the distress tolerance module. Practical Issues in Skills Training 13 Heterogeneous versus Homogeneous Groups DBT skills training group members in my clinic are homogeneous with respect to diagnosis: they are restricted to individuals who meet criteria for BPD and who haVe engaged in recent parasuicidal acts (intentional self-injurious behaviors; see Chapter 1 of the text for a full explanation of this term). Group members are not particularly homogeneous in other ways. Ages range from 16 to 48 years; some groups include clients of both sexes; and socioeconomic, marital, and parental statuses vary. For all of our clients so far, our group has represented their first experience of being with other individuals sharing very similar difficulties. Although from my perspective a homogeneous group is an asset in doing group therapy with this population, the choice obviously has its pros and cons. Arguments Against a Homogeneous Group There are a number of rather strong arguments against a homogeneous group of suicidal, borderline clients. First, such a group is risky on an outpatient basis. Any kind of therapy, individual or group, can be very stressful for borderline clients. Their extreme emotional reactivity all but insures that intense emotions will be aroused, requiring skillful therapeutic management. A therapist has to be very good at reading and responding to nonverbal cues and indirect verbal communicationsa difficult task under the best of circumstances. Therapeutic comments are often misinterpreted, or interpreted in a way that the therapist did not mean and insensitive comments have a strong impact. With even the most vigilant and sensitive therapist, there will often be times when a client leaves an individual therapy session in more emotional turmoil than when she came in. Frequent phone calls are often needed to resolve the issue. These problems are simply compounded in group therapy. It is impossible for one or two therapists to track and respond individually to each group member\\'s emotional responses to a therapy session. With more clients and a faster pace than in individual therapy, there are more opportunities for therapists to make mistakes and insensitive remarks, as well as for clients to misconstrue what is going on. In addition, it is more difficult for a client to express her emotional reactions to a group therapist in front of other group members. Thus the possibility for clients leaving in turmoil, with emotional responses they cannot handle, is greatly increased in group over individual therapy. A second, related drawback to homogeneous groups has to do with the tendency of clients to become emotionally involved with one anothers\\' problems and tragedies. Clients often become anxious, angry, depressed, and hopeless not only about the problems in their own lives, but also about the problems of those close to them. Thus, just listening to others\\' life descriptions can precipitate intense, painful emotional responses. This problem has been a very difficult issue for us staff members to handle among ourselves; we also have to listen to painful story after story from our clients. Imagine how much more difficult it is for individuals who have little capacity to modulate their responses to emotionally charged information. Another argument against homogeneous groups is based on the notion that in a group with only borderline clients, there will be no one to model appropriate, adaptive behaviors-or, similarly, that there will be extensive modeling of inappropriate behaviors. I have simply not found this to be the case. In fact, I am frequently amazed at the capacity of our clients to be helpful to one another in coping with life\\'s problems. The one area where an absence of appropriate modeling does seem to exist is in the area of coping with extreme negative feelings. Especially at the beginning of treatment, it is often necessary for the group leaders to take much of the responsibility for modeling how to cope with negative emotions in a nonsuicidal manner. A fourth argument against homogeneous groups has to do with the active passivity of borderline individuals (see Chapter 3 of the text for a description of this behavioral pattern), their ability to \"catch\" others\\' moods and behavior, and their inability to act in a moodindependent fashion. Contagion of suicidal behavior can be a particularly difficult problem. At times, if one group member comes to a session in a discouraged or depressed mood, all members of the group will soon be feeling the same way. If group leaders are not careful, even they can sink down with the members. One of the reasons why we have two leaders for each group in our clinic (for further discussion, see below) is that when this happens, each therapist will have someone to keep him or her functioning at an energetic leveL It can be very difficult. Finally, it is sometimes said that the borderline clients are more prone to \"attention seeking\" than are other clients, and that this tendency will be disruptive to any group process. Once again, I have not found this to be the case. Arguments for a Homogeneous Group From my perspective, there are two powerful arguments for a homogeneous group. First, homogeneity allows the group leaders to tailor the skills and theoretical conceptions offered specifically for problems of suicidal behaviors and BPD. Most of the skills taught are applicable 14 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER for many client populations. However, a heterogeneous group would require a much more generic presentation of the skills, and the application of the skills to each person\\'s central problems would have to be worked out individually. A common conceptual scheme would be difficult to present unless it was very general. A second argument for a homogeneous group is the opportunity for clients to be with a group of individuals who share the same problems and concerns. In my experience, this is a very powerful validating experience for our clients. Many have been in other groups. As noted above, however, they have not had the experience of being around others who actually understand the often inexplicable urges to injure themselves, the desire to be dead, the frustration of being unable to control emotions and behavior, and the pain of emotional invalidating experiences. All know intimately the difficulty of confronting emotional pain in anything other than a maladaptive way. A factor that can complicate the advantage of having an entire group of suicidal individuals has to do with different rates of individual progress in treatment. When one client is engaging in frequent self-injury and suicide attempts, it is very validating to have other group members struggling with the same issue. However, once the client has stopped such behaviors, it can be very hard for herself if others are still engaging in the self-injurious behaviors. Hearing about others\\' self-injury and overdoses seems to cause a greater urge to do the same thing; this is, of course, a threatening experience for the person who is working hard at avoiding self-harm. In addition, we have found that as a client progresses in therapy, she often begins to change her self-image from that of \"borderline person\" to that of \"nonborderline person:\\' Especially if she is still judgmental, she can find it very hard to stay in a group defined as a group for borderline individuals. These two issues-the urge to imitate suicidal behavior, and the need to change one\\'s selfimage from borderline to nonborderline -must be dealt with effectively by the group leaders if an individual is to continue with the group. The Role of Individual Psychotherapy in Psychosocial Skills Training As I have said previously, skills training with suicidal, borderline clients is an adjunct to individual psychotherapy. It is a part of DBT; it is not the total treatment. The key idea in DBT skills training is that it is the servant of individual psychotherapy, so to speak. It provides the day that the individual therapist and client can use together to mold a functional figure. With severely dysfunctional borderline clients skills training cannot stand alone. This point is crucial to keep in mind. What kind of individual psychotherapy works best with skills training? Our research data suggest that DBT individual therapy plus DBT skills training is superior to non-DBT individual therapy plus skills training (Linehan, Heard, & Armstrong, 1993). Therapists conducting skills training, however, may not always have control over the type of individual psychotherapy their clients get. This is especially likely in community mental health settings and inpatient psychiatric units. In settings where DBT is just being introduced, there simply may not be enough DBT individual therapists to go around. Or a unit may be trying to integrate different approaches to treatment. For example, a number of psychiatric inpatient units have attempted an integration of DBT skills training with individual psychodynamic therapy. Acute inpatient units may structure psychosocial treatment primarily around milieu and skills training, with individual therapy consisting of pharmacotherapy. When skills training is offered outside of standard DBT, some modifications in the actual conduct of the skills training may be necessary. The exact modifications necessary depend somewhat on what kind of individual psychotherapy is being offered, as well as on the skills trainers\\' relationship with the individual psychotherapists. When the Individual Psychotherapist Does Not Incorporate Skills Coaching Into Psychotherapy Although some effort is made to integrate into current everyday life the new behaviors taught in skills training, the lack of time and the complexity of achieving such an integration require that each clients\\' individual therapist be actively engaged in helping the client apply the skills. The individual therapist is the day-to-day coach for the client. One task of the DBT therapist is to apply the lens of behavioral skills when helping the client generate solutions to the problems she is confronting. Thus, when distress tolerance is the current treatment module (or a skill the therapist wishes the client to practice), problems may be viewed as ones where distress tolerance is needed. If interpersonal effectiveness is the focus, then the individual therapist may ask how the problem (or the solution) might be related to interpersonal actions. Generally, problems become \"problems\" because the events are associated with aversive emotional responses; one solution may be for the client to change her emotional response to the situation. An effective response may also be cast in terms of core mindfulness skills. Practical Issues in Skills Training 15 The ability to apply anyone of the behavioral skills to any problematic situation is at once important and very difficult. Individual therapists must themselves know the behavioral skills inside and out and be able to think quickly in a session or a crisis. When the individual therapist is not familiar with the skills being taught, the solution is to do what is possible to inform the therapist. Strategies for this are discussed below. The required active intervention and coaching may not be compatible with the individual psychotherapy a particular therapist is willing to engage in. Some therapists, for example, view helping clients learn new skillful behaviors as treating the \"symptoms\" instead of the \"illness.\" In one setting starting DBT, individual psychotherapists (who were physicians) told clients that they had to get coaching from the nurses in how to replace maladaptive behaviors with skills. In my experience, clients with such therapists will need extra help in using the skills they are learning. They also need help in accepting the idea that the new skills are actually important, since their individual therapists are communicating that the \"real therapy\" is taking place with them. Skills trainers can make a number of optional modifications to address these issues. They might set up an extra weekly training skills meeting where clients can get help in figuring out how to use their skills in troublesome life situations. But, people often need help at the moment they are in crisis. Skills training is like teaching basketball. Coaches not only conduct practice sessions during the week, they also attend the weekly game to help the players use what they were practicing all week. With outpatients, this is usually best done via telephone calls. In standard DBT, phone calls to skills training therapists are severely limited; almost all calls for help are directed to the clients\\' individual therapists. If an individual therapist does not take calls or give coaching, however, a skills trainer may decide to accept them at least when the reason for calling is to get such coaching. On an inpatient unit, milieu staff members should learn the behavioral skills along with the clients. The staff members can then serve as coaches for the clients. One inpatient unit offers weekly skills consultation meetings. The meetings are run like academic office hours; clients can come any time during office hours for advice. (This variation was developed by Charles Swenson at Cornell Medical. Center/New York Hospital at White Plains.) Ideally, clients can also call on one another for help. In another inpatient setting, one therapist teaches new skills; nursing staff members conduct regular homework review groups, where clients meet together to go over their attempts to practice new skills and get help with areas of difficulty; and individual therapists reinforce use of skills by the clients (Barley et aI., in press). When the Individual Therapist Assumes That the Skills Trainer Will Help with Suicidal Crises One of the key differences between DBT and many nonDBT individual therapies is the emphasis in DBT on modifying current maladaptive behaviors before ameliorating long-standing interpersonal conflicts and effects of early trauma and abuse. In fact, the DBT stance is that current high-risk suicidal behaviors (including all instances of parasuicide), therapy-interfering behaviors, and extreme quality-of-life-interfering behaviors must be modified before any sustained attempt is made to explore and resolve intensely disturbing interpersonal conflicts and previous abuse or trauma. Therapeutic exposure to stress requires, at a minimum, the ability to tolerate stress without resorting to suicide, parasuicide, extreme suicidal ideation, excessive therapyinterfering behaviors, or other extremely dysfunctional behaviors. But-and this is the most important point-reduction of these maladaptive behaviors is not the goal specific to DBT skills training. Instead, skills training is focused on teaching general skills that the clients can apply to current problems in living. Application of these skills to current suicidal behavior, to behaviors interfering with therapy progress, and to other severely dysfunctional behaviors is not necessarily attempted in the first year by skills training therapists. In fact, as I discuss later, discussion of current parasuicidal behavior is actively discouraged in skills training. The application of skills to very high-stress situations is not encouraged during early stages of skills training because it violates principles of shaping. Therapy-interfering behaviors, including extreme problems with skills training, are relegated to the individual therapists primarily because of time constraints in conducting skills training. Problems with this skills training orientation arise when an individual therapist wants to ignore current maladaptive behaviors in favor of attending to long-term conflicts and early childhood experiences. Such an individual therapy emphasis, in the absence of a corresponding emphasis on coping skills, can lead to an exacerbation of current dysfunctional behaviors. The problems can be especially intense if the individual therapist misunderstands the goals of DBT skills training, mistaking it for a treatment focused directly on modifying current severely dysfunctional and suicidal behaviors. In my experience, many non-DBT therapists do not 16 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER want to attend to the direct modification of current behaviors -an understandable reluctance if they are not behaviorally trained, and instead are relying on behaviorally oriented skills training therapy to do the job. Unfonunately, the skills training therapists in DBT are relying on the individual therapists in a similar manner. And therein lies the problem: In this case, no one is helping the dients modify their current style of coping with intensely disturbing experiences (posttraumatic stress, intrapsychic conflicts, interpersonal conflicts, or other major life stresses). The problem is even worse when the individual therapists, relying on the skills training to develop the client\\'s everyday coping abilities, begin to increase the stress level of individual therapy material while simultaneously reducing efforts at teaching coping skills. When this occurs, it seems reasonable to predict that the addition of DBT skills training to non-DBT individual therapy may be iatrogenic rather than therapeutic. In these instances, it would seem necessary to conduct skills training for clients not receiving DBT individual therapy separately from skills training for the standard DBT clients. In this separate context, the pace should be slowed considerably, and a mechanism must be developed for discussion of suicidal behaviors in the skills training setting. One option is to schedule a second weekly session for just this purpose. Since such a discussion is often very disturbing to other clients, care must be taken to frame the discussion in a context of positive coping behaviors; to pay attention to silent clients who may be getting more suicidal without being able to express it; to plan work on individual coping strategies for after skills training meetings; and to make resources available after meetings for clients who become more suicidal during meetings. All this is needed because, in my experience, suicidal individuals typically experience increased urges to engage in parasuicide when the topic of prior suicidal behavior (including urges) is discussed. It is precisely this escalation of risk, of course, that keeps many individual therapists from addressing the topic directly with their clients. Unfonunately, when the responsibility is shifted to the skills training therapists, the potential for trauma increases enormously. Consultation Between Individual Psychotherapists and Skills Trainers The problems discussed above sometimes result from poor communication between individual therapists and skills trainers. If the expectations of each group of therapists for the other are not spelled out and frequently reviewed, it is no wonder that the two treatments do not enhance each other. Among the most imponant aspects of DBT are the supervision/consultation strategies (described in Chapter 13 of the text). These strategies require all DBT therapists to meet on a regular basis. The goals of these meetings are to share information and to keep therapists within the frame of DBT. In my clinic, a supervision/consultation meeting is held each week for 2 hours. During the meeting, individual clients are discussed. The skills training therapists review for the individual therapists which skills are the current focus of group sessions. When necessary, the skills trainers actually teach the other therapists the skills. In this context, it is helpful for clients and decreases the potential for confusion if the individual and skills training therapists share a common language in discussing application of behavioral skills. Although consistency and conformity between various treating agents are not particularly valued in DBT, such consistency here can be useful, since the number of new skills to be learned is quite large. The weekly meetings increase this communality. In addition, any problems individual clients may be having in applying skills and/or interacting in skills training meetings are also mentioned. Individual therapists both consult with the skills trainers and take such information into account in planning the individual treatment. My emphasis on the imponance of meetings between individual and skills training therapists may seem to contradict the \"consultation-to-the-patient\" strategies, which are also integral to DBT. (See Chapter 13 of the text for a discussion of these strategies; they are also discussed briefly in Chapter 5 of this manual.) First, I must point out that these consultation strategies do require DBT therapists to walk a very fine line. The issues are somewhat complex. When the therapeutic unit is defined as a group of people (including the individual and skills training therapists), a clinic, an inpatient unit, or some such entity where multiple therapists interact with particular clients in a coordinated treatment program, then consultation between therapists is essential, provided that the clients are informed of and consent to such collaboration. Applying the consultation strategies in these cases simply requires that therapists refrain from intervening with each other on behalfof a client. Thus, therapists must be careful not to fall into the trap of serving as intermediaries for a client. A particularly difficult situation arises when a client\\'s individual therapist works separately from the skills trainers and does not want to consult with them or does not have the time to do so. Can progress be made? The answer depends on the individual therapist\\'s willingness and ability to assist the client in integrating skills independently. A therapist with good behavioral treatment skills could probably do a creditable job unPractical Issues in Skills Training 17 der some circumstances. First, the individual psychotherapist needs to elicit from the client sufficient information about the skills taught in skills training to be able to help the client apply the skills in troublesome areas. Second, the therapist needs to know and be able to apply the skills himself or herself; this is not as simple as it might seem. Third, the therapist needs to resist the temptation to rely on the skills trainer to conduct interventions aimed at reducing current suicidal and other severely dysfunctional behaviors. In my clinic, when skills training is offered to individuals with non-DBT individual therapists, we inform the therapists that we cannot accept their clients if they do not agree to coach the clients in applying skills. We then send the therapists our skills training materials. I discuss the issue of guidelines for handling suicidal and crisis behaviors at greater length later. Group Leaders In my experience, two leaders are essential for the conduct of group skills training in DBT. The primary reason for this is therapist burnout, which can happen very quickly to a therapist trying to conduct a group alone. The constant passivity, hopelessness, emotional vulnerability, and invalidation that pervade group skills training in the early months are all but impossible for a lone therapist to tolerate. The tendency of group members to withdraw emotionally in the face of group tension or conflict, including attempts by the therapist to \"push\" individual members along, creates a countertendency in the therapist to pull back, blame the victims, and then lash out at group members. Resisting this tendency alone is next to impossible over the long haul. The primary function of the second leader is to provide the dialectical balance and personal support that keeps the teetertotter (of acceptance and change; see Chapters 2 and 7 of the text) balanced for yet another week. In our groups, we use a model of a primary group leader and a coleader. The functions of the two leaders during a typical session differ somewhat. The primary leader begins the meetings, conducts the initial behavioral analyses of homework practice, and presents new skills material. The primary group therapist is also responsible for the timing of the session, moving from person to person as time allows. Thus, the primary group leader has overall responsibility for skills acquisition. The coleader\\'s functions are more diverse. First, he or she mediates tensions that arise between members and the primary leader, providing a balance from which a synthesis can be created. Second, while the primary group leader is looking at the group as a whole, the coleader keeps a focus on each individual member, noting any need for individual attention and either addressing that need directly during group sessions or consulting with the primary leader during breaks. Third, the coleader serves as a coteacher and tutor, offering alternate explanations, examples, and so on. Generally, if there is a \"bad guy\" it is the primary group leader, who enforces the group norms, and if there is a \"good guy\" it is the coleader, who always tries to see life from the point of view of the person who is \"down:\\' More often than not in a group meeting, though not always, the person who is \"down\" is a group member; thus, the \"good guy\" image emerges for the coleader. As long as both leaders keep the dialectical perspective of the whole, this division of labor and roles can be quite therapeutic. Obviously, it requires a degree of personal security on the part of both therapists if it is to work. The DBT therapist supervision/consultation strategies can be especially important here. The supervision group serves as the third point providing the dialectical balance between the two coleaders, much as the coleader does between the primary leader and a group member in a group session. Thus, the function of the DBT supervision/consultation group is to highlight the truth in each side of an expressed tension, fostering reconciliation and synthesis. 3 Session Format and Starting Skills Training Format and Organization of Sessions There are a number of possible formats for skills training sessions. In my dinic, group skills training sessions last for 21/2 hours, generally with a break in the middle. The format is reasonably consistent for the whole year. The first hour is devoted to opening rituals, followed by group members\\' sharing their attempts to practice behavioral skills (or lack thereof) during the preceding week, followed by a break. The second hour is devoted to presenting and discussing new skills. The last 15 minutes are for session \"wind-down.\" Some inpatient settings have split this format in two, holding two weekly sessions-one devoted to homework review and one devoted to new skills. This is a reasonable model on inpatient and day treatment units where staff members have some ability to persuade clients to attend both weekly sessions. In an outpatient setting, however, there is a danger that clients will not attend homework review sessions when they have not practiced any of their skills during the preceding week. Skills trainers will want to prevent that from occurring. Other settings have tried to shorten the session time, usually from 2V2 to 11/2 hours. In our experience, 1Y2 hours simply does not give enough time for a group session. Even with 21/2 hours, SO to 60 minutes for homework review with eight group members gives each member from 6 to 8 minutes of group attention-not very much. Nor is 50 to 60 minutes for new material much time, either. Although group leaders can present a lot of material in that time, they also need time to do insession practice of new skills, to discuss questions about the week\\'s new content, to check skill comprehension with each member, and to go over new homework sheets to be sure that clients understand how to do the practice and how to record it. Individual skills training can be accomplished in weekly 45-to 50-minute sessions. The first 30-60 minutes of each new skills training module (remember that there are four) is spent in discussing the rationale for that particular module. (In an ongoing group, the time devoted to homework review is cut short the first session of each new module.) The leaders\\' task here is to convince the clients that the skills to be covered in the upcoming module are relevant to their lives; that if they improve these particular skills their lives will improve, and, most importantly, that they can actually learn the skills. The leaders often have to be creative in demonstrating how particular sets of skills apply to particular problems. The specific rationale for each module is described in Chapters 7-10. Session Start-Up At our group sessions we serve noncaffeinated coffee and tea (and usually snacks as well); the beginning of the group consists of each member\\'s getting her coffee or tea and getting settled. The first task is to fill out whatever research or treatment evaluation scales we may be using at that point. If a member has missed one or more previous sessions, she is given a chance to tell the group where she has been. If missing sessions is a problem for such a person, some time (no more than 5 or so minutes) can be spent analyzing what interferes with her coming and how to overcome it. If there are group issues (e.g., announcements; not calling when missing, or coming late), they are dealt with at the beginning of the session. This brief attention to therapyinterfering behaviors is very important and should not be dropped. 18 Session Format and Starting Skills Training 19 Sharing of Practice Effortsl Homework Review The next phase of treatment is the sharing of efforts to practice the specific behavioral skills (mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, distress tolerance) being taught. In our group sessions, the primary group leader goes around the circle and asks each member to share with the group what she has practiced during the preceding week. (In my experience, waiting for members to volunteer takes up too much time. However, I may let members decide who to start with in going around the circle.) Vocabulary can be very important here. Behaviorists are used to calling practice \"homework;\\' and therefore to asking clients about their \"homework practice:\\' Some of our clients like this terminology and prefer to think of skills training as a class they are taking, much like a college course. Others feel demeaned by the words, as if they are being treated like children in school, once again having to report to adults. A discussion of the semantics at the very beginning of treatment can be successful in defusing this issue. The weekly sharing of homework practice efforts is an essential part of skills training. The sure knowledge that not only will each client be asked about her efforts to practice skills, but that not practicing will be analyzed in depth, serves as a powerful motivation for at least attempting to practice skills during the week. The norm of weekly in vivo practice is set and maintained during the sharing. Every client should be asked to share her experiences, even those who communicate extreme reluctance or aversion to the task. This part of the session is so important that its completion takes precedence over any other group task. To finish the sharing in the 50 to 60 minutes allotted takes very good time management skills on the part of the primary leader, as noted above. However, the usual absence of one or more clients together with the equally usual tendency of one or two each week to refuse to interact more than briefly, adds considerably to the time per person available for sharing. Managing practice sharing requires enormous sensitivity on the part of the leaders. The tasks here are to prod each client gently to analyze her own behavior; to validate her difficulty and counter her tendency to judge herself negatively and hold tenaciously to impossibly high standards; and at the same time to help her develop, if needed, more effective skill strategies for the coming week. In addition, the leaders must be adept at alternating attention between analysis of the week\\'s behaviors and focusing on the in-session attempts to describe, analyze, and solve problems. Fear of criticism or looking \"stupid;\\' shame, humiliation, embarrassment, selfhatred, and anger are common emotions interfering with the ability to engage in and profit from sharing. Deft handling of these emotions -combining validating strategies with problem-solving strategies, and irreverent communication with reciprocal communicationis the key to using practice sharing therapeutically. If the client has practiced and the skills have worked, she should be supported and encouraged by the leaders. Other clients are asked to comment on the similarity of the practice or situation to their own lives. Client-to-client praise and encouragement are reinforced. It is very important to get each client to describe in detail her use of the skills in that particular week\\'s problematic situations. The same amount of attention to detail must be given to the week\\'s successes as to the week\\'s difficulties. In addition, over time the leaders can use such information to identify the client\\'s patterns in skill usage. This is especially important if a client is consistently reporting only one skill strategy. For example, in one of my groups I had a client who always tried to change problem situations as her primary method of emotion regulation. Although her skills at problemsolving situations were excellent and commendable, nonetheless, it was also important for her to learn other methods (e.g., cognitive restructuring, tolerating the situation, distracting herself, etc.). Not every problem situation can be changed. My experience is that when given a limited amount of time to share, borderline clients will almost always share their successes in using skills and will rarely want to describe their problems and failures. Thus, listening carefully to the successes is even more important than it might be with other populations. When the Skills Did Not Help Ifa client could not use the skills being taught, or reports using the skills but not getting any benefits from them, the leaders use problem-solving strategies to help the client analyze what happened, what went wrong, and how she could use the skills better next time. This is a very important opportunity for the leaders to model how to analyze situations and behaviors and how to apply self-management skills. Over time, it is important to encourage and reinforce clients in helping one another analyze and solve difficult problems. When a Client Has Difficulty with Homework During sharing, a client will often report that she did not practice at all during the preceding week. It would be an error to take the meaning of this comment at face value. On close examination, we often find that the client did practice; she just did not actually solve the problem. The discussion then turns to the issue of shaping and setting appropriate expectations. Often we find that the client does not have a complete understanding of how 20 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER to practice the skill assigned. Or we may find that she does not understand many of the skills discussed previously but has been afraid to ask questions; in this instance, both the self-censoring of questions and the problem in homework practice should be discussed. Whenever possible, it is useful to encourage or ask other clients to help the person having difficulty. In the case of interpersonal effectiveness, we may ask another client to role-play how she would cope with the situation. Emotion regulation and distress tolerance do not lend themselves to demonstration, but other clients can share how they have coped (or would cope) with similar situations. Finally, a client who says she did not practice sometimes actually did practice, but did it either without realizing she had done it or by using skills learned outside skills training. This information can be missed completely if the patient\\'s experiences during the week are not explored in enough depth. Each skills training module contains a large number of specific behavioral skills. It is usually not such a good idea to present a lot of individual skills to be learned when conducting skills training; the idea is that it is better to learn a few skills well than a lot of skills poorly. However, in my experience with borderline individuals, presenting a lot of skills counteracts two problems. First, the need for a lot of skills suggests that the therapist is not oversimplifying the problems to be solved. Second, presenting a lot of skills works against a client\\'s being able to say credibly that absolutely nothing works. If one thing doesn\\'t work, the therapist can always suggest trying a different skill. With a lot of skills to draw from, the client\\'s patience for resisting usually runs out before the therapist\\'s patience for offering new skills to try. In addition, what works for whom is very individual. Leaders must be very careful, however, in assuming that the problem is that the client used the wrong skill. Inexperienced leaders often give up on a skill too easily. They may assume that the specific skill is not a good match for a specific group member when, in actuality, the client has not been applying the skill properly. When a Client Did Not Do Any Homework Practice When a client actually did not practice or attempt to do so, this absence is analyzed. Common reasons given by clients for not practicing are not wanting to, not remembering, and not having an occasion to. Rarely can they identi.(y the situational factors influencing their lack of motivation, failure to remember, or inability to observe practice opportunities. Usually, the application of problem solving to the failure to practice reveals a pervasive difficulty in analyzing behavior (or the lack of behavior) and then applying learning principles to bring about desired changes. Borderline individuals tend to use punishment, commonly in the form of self-denigration, as a form of behavior control. \"If I didn\\'t do it, I must not have wanted to do it\" is a frequent comment. This comment, however, requires careful analysis: Motivational interpretations are often learned in previous therapies, even when they have little to do with reality. Even if the problem is one of motivation, the question of what is interfering with motivation must be addressed. Failures in motivation and in memory offer important opportunities for the leaders to teach principles of behavioral management and learning. The goal over time is to use these principles to replace the judgmental theories based on willpower and mental illness that borderline individuals often hold. Failure to practice is a problem to be solved. In a group setting, when a member has not attempted to practice during the preceding week, she will often not want to discuss why she didn\\'t practice, and will ask the primary leader simply to go on to the next person. In my experience, it is essential that the leader not be convinced to do this. The analysis of not doing homework can be very important. In the case of the person who is avoiding the topic because of fear or shame, it offers a chance to practice \"opposite action;\\' a skill taught in the emotion regulation module. It also offers other group members an opportunity to practice their own behavior management and problem-solving skills within the context of the group. It is, of course, important that the leader resist the temptation to collude with a client in punishing herself for not practicing. Break Most clients get restless after about an hour or so of a group session. We usually take a 10-or is-minute break at about the halfway mark. Members can get a refill of coffee or tea, and a snack if provided. Most clients go to the smoking area or go outside for fresh air. This part of the session is important because it provides an unstructured period of time for group clients to interact. Generally, the group leaders stay near but somewhat apart from group clients. Group cohesion, independent of the leaders, is thus fostered. If a member needs individual attention, it is given at this point. One of our main problems has been that clients having a hard time at a session often leave during the break. We have found it advisable to be particularly alert to anyone who may be leaving, so that intervention can be attempted before she walks out. Presentation of New Material The hour after the break is devoted to the presentation and discussion of new skills (or, if necessary the review Session Format and Starting Skills Training 21 of ones already covered). The content and manner of skills presentation for each module are discussed in Chapters 7-10. Wind-Down A time at the end of a skills training session for winding down seems particularly important for borderline clients. These sessions are almost always emotionally charged and painful for some. Borderline individuals are acutely aware of the negative effects of their own skill deficits. Without emotion regulation skills of their own, clients can be in great emotional difficulty following a session, especially if nothing is done to help them regulate their affect and end or \"close up\" the session, so to speak. A wind-down period also provides a time for clients who have dissociated during the session, usually because of painful memories, to come back into the session before parting. I was alerted to this need during my first DBT skills training group. After several months it came up in a group discussion that almost every member of the group was going out drinking after the meetings as a means of affect control. Skills trainers will often find that topics that seem very innocuous are actually very stress-provoking for borderline individuals. For example, a group member once became extremely emotional and disorganized as I was introducing the interpersonal effectiveness module and the fact that one task of the module would be to learn to say no effectively. She was currently enmeshed in a group of drug dealers who frequently raped her. She didn\\'t say no because the group was her meal ticket. I have used several methods of winding down. The most popular with our group members is the processobserving wind-down. In this method, we spend about 15 minutes sharing our observations of how things went in the session. Members may offer observations about themselves, one another, the leaders, or the group as a whole. Although the leaders may have to model such observations at the beginning of the year, members usually pick up on the method rapidly. As time progresses, we find that members usually become quite astute observers and describers of one another\\'s behavior, progress, mood changes, and apparent difficulties. At times, the leaders may facilitate more in-depth observations and comments by asking general questions about observations (e.g., \"What do you make of that?\"). Or the leaders may encourage a member to check out an observation, especially when an observation involves an inference about another\\'s feelings, mood state, or opinion. Another important leaders\\' task is to draw out members who do not spontaneously offer an observation. During wind-down, each member should be encouraged to offer at least one observation, even if that observation is simply that it is difficult to offer an observation. Although the process-observing wind-down may be the most popular, it is also the wind-down with the most potential for creating problems. These problems almost always have to do with the observation period\\'s getting out of control of the leader and ending in overly critical observations, in escalating responses to critical feedback, and occasionally in members\\' storming out and refusing ever to come back. This can be a special problem if more experienced or advanced clients (e.g., those who have gone through several skills training modules) are mixed with clients beginning in skills training. The more advanced clients may be ready for much more process than new clients can tolerate. The process-observing wind-down is a natural place for them to begin to try out more confrontational comments. I discuss the problems of too much process work in first-year skills training groups more thoroughly in Chapter 5 of this manual. A second wind-down method consists of leading clients through relaxation, visualization, meditation, and breathing exercises. The focus here is on observing internal events (body sensation, breath, thoughts, feelings, etc.). The exercise is begun by asking clients to get in a comfortable position in their chairs, with their backs straight. My experience is that borderline individuals are often so self-conscious about their bodies that for the first several months of doing these exercises, many will not move into a position of sitting up in their chairs. With time and patience, however, most clients eventually begin to enter fully into the exercises. They are then instructed either to close their eyes or to keep them only partially opened. Once again, several clients can be expected to have difficulty closing their eyes in the session; nor is it necessary that they do so. For those keeping their eyes open, we ask them to find a place to look that is not too distracting. Third, clients are instructed to focus their attention on their breathing, as they take three very deep breaths, hold each for a second or two, and then let each out in a long, slow, exhalation. The focus on the three breaths is a vehicle for settling down and directing attention to inner experiences. At this point, a skills trainer directs the clients in a specific observing exercise. The possibilities are too innumerable to describe here. We may do an abbreviated relaxation exercise that consists of tensing and relaxing various body muscle groups. The modification we make is that the trainer consistently focuses the clients\\' attention on observing their internal body reactions and sensations. Or we may do a sensate focus exercise in which the trainer instructs clients to focus their attention on various body parts, noticing the sensations that arise in each. An exercise that I have found useful is one 22 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER that combines sensate focusing (\"Can you feel your arm resting on the arm rest?\") and visualization (\"Can you see a rose, just opening, in your mind\\'s eye?\"). Imaginal exercises may include imagining lying on a warm beach, drifting on a cloud, being a pebble lazily floating to the bottom of the ocean or some other similarly relaxing scene. Meditation exercises may focus on repeating a simple word over and over (such as the word \"one\") or on counting thoughts that go through the mind or breaths. In meditation it is particularly important to instruct clients to go back gently to the exercise, letting go of judging, whenever they find their minds drifting. In my experience, internal observation exercises such as those described above must be very brief at the beginning, not more than 5 minutes. Also, care must be taken to counter unrealistic performance expectations. For example, the drifting of attention in meditation is to be expected and accepted, not resisted. The idea is, simply, to keep coming back. Attempts to visualize may not be successful; people differ in their capacity for visual imagery. The key idea is to observe and accept whatever happens. As the discussion of core mindfulness skills in Chapter 7 indicates, these wind-down exercises involve practicing the skills ofobservingand taking a nonjudgmental stance. Process observing also includes practice in describing. Relaxation and meditation provide practice in focusing on one thing in the moment. Beginning Skills Training Building Relationships Use of the therapeutic relationship strategies (see Chapter 15 of the text) is particularly important at the start of skills training. In a group context, among the first tasks of the group leaders are to enhance the bonding between group clients and the leaders, and to begin the process of building group cohesion. We have found it useful to have the leaders call each.new group member a few days before th~ first skills training meeting to remind her of the session, clarify directions, and communicate looking forward to meeting her. It is also a good time for the leaders to address last-minute fears and plans to drop out before even starting (not uncommon plans for borderline clients). The leaders should arrive a few minutes early before each group meeting, including the first, to greet clients and interact briefly but individually with each one. For reluctant and/or fearful clients, this can be a soothing experience. It also offers an opportunity for leaders to hear concerns and refute plans to leave early. We try to confine these individual interactions to the context of group mingling, in order to keep the essential identity of group rather than individual therapy. This issue is discussed further below. As might be expected, group members are very timid and fearful during the first meeting. Appropriate behavior is not clear, and the trustworthiness of group clients is doubtful. We generally begin by going around the group and asking each person to give her name, how she heard about the group, and any information about herself she cares to share. The group leaders also give information about themselves and how they came to be leading the group. The next task of skills trainers is to help clients see the relevance of a skills training model to their own lives. An overview of the skills training treatment year is given; a theory of BPD and suicidal behaviors that stresses the role of inadequate skills is presented; and the format for the upcoming sessions is described. Discussion is elicited at each point about the relevance of the material to the client\\'s own experiences. A handout illustrating the relationship between characteristics of BPD and skills training is distributed and discussed (see Chapter 6 of this manual for details); usually I also write this on the blackboard in the therapy room. It is essential here for the skills trainer to communicate an expectancy that the treatment will be effective at helping the clients improve the quality of their own lives. The treatment must be \"marketed\" to clients. (See Chapters 9 and 14 of the text for further discussion of marketing therapy to clients and eliciting commitments.) At this time I usually make the point that DBT is not a suicide prevention program, but a life enhancement program. It is not our idea to get people to live lives not worth living, but rather to help them build lives they actually want to live. Validation and didactic strategies (see Chapters 8 and 9 of the text) are the primary treatment vehicles here. Skills Training Rules It is important to make the rules of skills training explicit at the very beginning, as well as to discuss possible misconceptions about how to \"get around\" the rules. Presentation of the rules offers an opportunity for the skills trainers to specify and obtain agreement to the treatment contract from each client. In a group context, it can be useful after discussion of the rules to go around the room and ask each group member for an individual commitment to abide by them. My experience is that the presentation and discussion of rules can usually be accomplished during the first session. In an open group, the rules should be discussed each time a new member enters the group. Often it is a good idea to have old members explain the rules to new members. The skills trainers need to be aware that the disSession Format and Starting Skills Training 23 cussion of rules is an important part of the treatment process, not a precursor to the process. As such, it will be repeated over and over as skills training progresses. Presentation of rules in an authoritarian way will probably alienate some clients, especially those for whom issues of control are important. Rules I have found useful are discussed below. (They are also presented to clients in a handout; see Chapter 6.) I. Clients Who Drop Out of Therapy Are Out of Theropy Clients who miss 4 weeks of scheduled skills training sessions in a row have dropped out of therapy and cannot re-enter for the duration of the time in their treatment contract. For example, if a client has contracted for 1 year, but misses 4 weeks in a row during the sixth month, then she is out for the next 6 months or so. At the end of the contracted time, she can negotiate with the skills trainer(s) (and the group, if she was in one and it is continuing) about readmission. There are no exceptions to this rule. The rule for skills training, thus, is the same as the rule for individual DBT psychotherapy. We mention that although it is technically possible to repeatedly miss three sessions in a row and come to the fourth, that would be a violation of the spirit of the rule. In our advanced groups, the rules for what constitute dropping out vary, and are adopted by group consensus. For example, in one group, three \"unexcused\" absences in any 4-month period are the equivalent of dropping out of the group. In all groups, we make it crystal clear at the beginningeither by presenting the rules as in first-year groups, or by mutual decision making in ongoing groups-how one goes about dropping out of therapy. The message communicated is that we expect everyone to come to skills training sessions each week. Presentation of this rule offers an opportunity to discuss what constitutes an acceptable reason for missing a session. Not being in the mood, nonserious illness, social engagements, fear, beliefs that \"No one in the group likes me;\\' and so forth, do not qualify; serious illness, very important events, and unavoidable trips out of town do. In our first research project with 24 clients in standard DBT group skills training plus DBT individual therapy, we had a I-year dropout rate of 16.4% -considerably below the 50-80% dropout rate we expected. In a second study, we had 12 clients receiving DBT skills training plus ongoing non-DBT individual psychotherapy in the community. There was a 27% dropout rate at 1 year, which again was lower than the expected 50% rate. I suspect that our emphasis on a time-limited commitment and the clarity of the rules about how to drop out are crucial in our low dropout rate. The rule clarity is important for two reasons. First, it tells clients that if they miss 1, 2, or 3 weeks in a row, even without calling, they are still welcome back. They know ahead of time that their behavior is not totally unexpected and they will not be terminated from skills training. Second, it makes it more difficult for people just to slide out of therapy without quite realizing they are doing it. Each week, clients are aware of where the line is between staying in skills training and dropping out. 2. Each Client Has to Be in Ongoing Individual Therapy The fact that skills training in DBT is designed to be an adjunct to individual psychotherapy for borderline clients is presented clearly at the beginning of therapy. Clients may switch individual therapists during the course of skills training, but they cannot go 4 consecutive weeks without a session with an individual therapist. Four consecutive weeks of no individual therapy is considered dropping out of skills training. When clients are in our standard DBT program (group skills training plus individual therapy), dropping out of individual therapy (unless we have another individual therapist available or can find one in the community) is tantamount to dropping out of group skills training, and therefore out of the total treatment program. Individual therapy is needed for several reasons. First, with a group of eight seriously suicidal clients, it would be extraordinarily difficult for the skills trainers to handle the crisis calls that might be needed. The caseload is simply too large. Second, in a skills oriented program meeting only once a week, there is not much time to attend to individual process issues that may come up. Nor is there time to adequately help each individual integrate the skills into her life. Some need much more time than do others on particular skills, and the need to adjust the pace to the average needs makes it very likely that without outside attention everyone will fail to learn at least some of the skills. This early beginning emphasis on highlighting the likely need of each participant for extra help in mastering the skills is very important later when the clients run into difficulty. It is all too easy for the trainers to overestimate the ease of learning skills; such overestimation sets the clients up for later disillusionment and hopelessness. This is also a good time to communicate that, in general, the discussions will focus on the skills being learned and on how each client can use the skills in her own life. Thus, with brief exceptions, discussion of current life problems and crises will not be encouraged. It is crucial, however, that the skills trainers validate the need to discuss problems with someone. They are im24 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER portant and serious; thus, this is another reason for individual therapy. In a group context, it is essential at this point that the leaders discuss the difference between a skills training group and other group therapies. Many individuals look forward to a group where they can share with individuals like themselves. Although there is much sharing in the group, it is not unlimited and it is focused on practicing skills, not on whatever crises may have occurred during the week. Many participants have never been in any kind of behavior therapy, much less a skillsoriented group. My experience is that the difference cannot be stressed too much. Often the clients have had an enormous amount of nonbehavioral therapy in which they have been taught various \"necessary ingredients\" for therapeutic change-ingredients often not focused on extensively in skills training. In every group we have conducted so far, one or more clients have gotten angry about their inability to talk about \"what is really important\" in the group. For one client, talking about whatever comes to mind was so firmly associated with the process of therapy that she refused to acknowledge that skills training could be a form of therapy. Needless to say, there was much friction with her in the group. The requirement for individual therapy can be quite formidable at times. In our experience, it is not uncommon for individual therapists in the community to get pushed past their limits and then to terminate therapy precipitously with borderline clients. When this happens, it can be extraordinarily difficult to find an individual therapist willing to work with such clients, especially with those who are mourning the loss of previous therapists. This is especially problematic when the clients cannot afford to pay the high fees often charged by professionals who are experienced enough to be helpful. Unfortunately, many public health clinics are so understaffed that they cannot provide individual psychotherapy, or clients may have already burned out their local clinics. In these cases, the skills training leaders often must function as short-term backup crisis therapists and assist the clients in finding appropriate individual therapists. 3. Clients Are Not to Come to Sessions under the Influence of Drugs or Alcohol As with the confidentiality rule, the value of the third rule is reasonably self-evident; thus there is little need for extensive discussion of it. However, it does offer an opportunity to discuss the emotional pain that skills training attendance is likely to cause much of the time. Accurate expectations are essential here to head off demoralization. Once again, the skills trainers can suggest that as clients learn emotion regulation skills, they will be better able to cope with the stress of skills training. Because it is so important in treating this population, this topic is discussed in more detail at a later point. 4. Clients Are Not to Discuss Past (E.ven if Immediate) Parasuicidal Behaviors with Other Clients Outside of Sessions The reasons for the fourth rule are several. First, at every point in DBT a major objective is to diminish the opportunity for reinforcement of suicidal behaviors. The usual (though not invariable) reactions from other clients to hearing of parasuicidal behaviors are sympathy, interest, and concern. Thus, just as in individual therapy, clients may not call their therapists after a parasuicidal act, in skills training they must agree not to call or communicate with one another after the fact. In addition, my experience is that communications about parasuicide elicit a strong imitation effect among borderline individuals. Hearing about another\\'s cutting, overdosing, or the like often elicits an urge to imitate it, which can be difficult to resist. Our group members usually very much welcome this rule. Before I instituted this rule, clients often complained that once they had given up the behavior themselves, it was very scary to listen to others describing their parasuicidal episodes. Discussion during sessions is acceptable, although not encouraged, because it offers an opportunity for clients to examine alternate methods of solving the problem leading up to the suicidal behavior. 5. Clients Who Call One Another for Help When Feeling Suicidal Must Be Willing to Accept Help from the Person Called It is not acceptable for a client to call someone, say \"I am going to kill myself;\\' and then refuse to let the person she called help. As noted in Chapter 8 of this manual, the inability to ask for help appropriately is a special problem for borderline individuals. Thus, this rule begins the process in the skills training context of teaching how to reach out to peers for help when needed. Like the fourth rule, this rule is usually a relief to clients. The rule itself was suggested by one of our group clients. Before the rule, we occasionally had instances of a member\\'s calling another member in desperate emotional pain, obliquely threatening suicide, extracting a promise of confidentiality out of the one called, and then hanging up after no apparent progress in the call. The helper was left with a very difficult dilemma. If she really cared about the caller, she would do something to save her life. Yet she clearly couldn\\'t do anything herself, and if she asked for outside help she was violating a confidence. The resulting helplessness and anguish were enormous. Session Format and Starting Skills Training 25 However, when this problem was discussed, group members made it very clear to me that if I put in a rule that they could not promise to keep such a confidence, they would simply stop asking for help from one another. One of the strengths of group skills training, however, is that members often build a strong supportive community among themselves. At times, they are the only ones able to really understand their mutual experiences. Since everyone\\'s suicidal and self-injurious desires are public, members need not be ashamed to ask one another for help. Not only is the opportunity for problem solving helpful to the caller, but the helper has a chance to practice generating problem solutions and reasons for living. In addition, and a point that therapists should note, such calls offer group members a structured chance to practice observing their own limits on how much help they are willing to give. 6. Information Obtained during Sessions, as Well as the Names of Clients, Must Remain Confidential The importance of the confidentiality rule is self-evident. What may not be obvious is that the rule extends to \"gossiping\" outside of sessions. The general notion here is that interpersonal problems between or among clients should be dealt with by the persons involved, either inside or outside of sessions. There are two exceptions to the confidentiality rule. First, clients can discuss what happens in skills training sessions with their individual therapists; this exception is important so that they can maximize the benefits of the therapy. But, clients are cautioned not to reveal other clients\\' last names unless absolutely necessary. The other exception has to do with the risk of suicide. If one client believes that another is likely to commit suicide, she can and should summon help. 7. Clients Who Are Going to Be Late or Miss a Session Should Call Ahead of Time The seventh rule serves several purposes. First, it is a courtesy to let skills trainers know not to wait for latecomers before starting. Although we have a general rule in our groups of starting on time, it is difficult not to hold off on important material or announcements for the first few minutes, in the expectation that missing clients will show up any minute. This is a special problem in those weeks where only one or two clients are present at the beginning. Second, it introduces an added response cost for being late and communicates to clients that promptness is desirable. Finally, it gives information as to why a client is not present. In a group context, when a person does not come to a session and gives no explanation ahead of time, group members (including the leaders) almost always start worrying about the welfare of the absent member. Suicide is one of the first explanations that jumps to mind (although we have not had an unexplained absence to date because of suicide); emotional distress is another possibility; hospitalization is a third. Sometimes, however, clients miss for reasons having nothing to do with problems. Thus, not calling causes unnecessary worry for the group members. Just the fact that others will worry is often news to some group members; for others, the worry is a source of emotional support and may reinforce not calling. In any case, the rule offers a vehicle for addressing the behavior. Presentation of the rule is an opportunity to discuss the need for courtesy and empathy to feelings of other group members, as well as the responsibility of each member to contribute to group cohesion. 8. Clients May Not Form Private Relationships Outside of Training Sessions The key word in the eighth rule is \"private.\" The meaning of this rule is that clients may not form relationships outside of the sessions that they then cannot discuss in the sessions. DBT\\' encourages outside-of-session relationships among group clients. In fact, the support that members can give one another with daily problems in living is one of the strengths of group DBT\\'. The model here is similar to that of Alcoholics Anonymous and other self-help groups, where calling one another between meetings, socializing, and offering mutual support are viewed as therapeutic. Encouragement of such relationships, however, provides the possibility for interpersonal conflict that is inherent in any relationship. For a group of individuals selected partially because they often have interpersonal difficulties, this possibly may be either an opportunity or a liability. The key is whether interpersonal problems that arise outside of the sessions can be discussed in the sessions (or, if that is too difficult, with the leaders). To the extent that such issues can be discussed and appropriate skills can be applied, a relationship can be advantageous. Troubles arise when a relationship cannot be discussed and problems increase to such an extent that one member finds it difficult or impossible to attend meetings, either physicmly or emotionally. Presentation of this rule alerts each member that leaders will respect the rights and needs of each member equally. It provides somewhat of a protective balance, communicating that it is unacceptable for one member to demand complete confidentiality about problems from another member. This is especially crucial when 26 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER it comes to plans for destructive behavior, important information that one person lies about in meetings, and other situations creating an untenable awkwardness for one member of the pair. 9. Sexual Partners May Not Be in Skills Training Together Assignment of current sexual partners to different groups at the onset is, of course, the responsibility of the group leaders. Thus, this rule functions to alert group members that if they enter into a sexual relationship, one member of the pair will have to drop out. To date we have had two sexual relationships begin among group members; both created enormous difficulties for the partners involved. In one case, the initiating partner broke off the relationship against the wishes of the other, making it very hard for the rejected partner to come to group sessions. In the other, one member was seduced reluctantly, leading to trauma and tension in the group. Generally, this rule is clear to everyone involved. Without the rule, however, dealing with an emerging sexual relationship between clients is very tricky, since post hoc application of rules is unworkable with borderline individuals. 4 Application of Structural Strategies and Skills Training Procedures to Psychosocial Skills Training DBT therapy strategies are grouped into five major categories: (1) dialectical strategies, (2) core strategies, (3) stylistic strategies, (4) case management strategies, and (5) integrative strategies. \"Strategies\" are coordinated activities, tactics, and procedures that a therapist employs to achieve treatment goals -in this case, the acquisition of psychosocial skills. \"Strategies\" also describe the role and focus of the therapist and may refer to coordinated responses that the therapist should give to a particular problem presented by a client. The core strategies of problem solving and validation, together with dialectical strategies, form the essential components of DBT. Stylistic strategies specify interpersonal and communication styles compatible with the therapy. Case management strategies specify how the therapist interacts with and responds to the social network in which the client is enmeshed. Integrative strategies outline how to handle specific problem situations that ordinarily come up in treating borderline individuals, such as problems in the therapeutic relationship, suicidal behaviors, therapy-interfering behaviors, and ancillary treatments. Structural strategies, a special category of integrative strategies, have to do with structuring therapy time. Some strategies will be used much more often than others, and it is possible tbat one or more of the strategies will be needed only rarely. Some strategies may not be necessary or appropriate for a given skills training session, and the pertinent combination of strategies may change over time. The structuring of treatment time (including the treatment targets or goals addressed) is the major factor differentiating DBT psychosocial skills training from DBT individual psychotherapy. In skills training, the therapy agenda is set by the behavioral skill to be taught; the agenda is set before a client shows up for the session. In individual DBT psychotherapy, the agenda is set by a client\\'s behavior since the last session and within the current session; the agenda is open until the client shows up for the session. Although in my clinic we conduct skills training in groups, as I have said before, it can be done individually. (I am also quite sure that DBT psychotherapy could be conducted in a group context, although I have not written a guide for that yet.) In this chapter, I first discuss how to use DBT structural strategies in skills training. (The other major strategies are reviewed briefly in the next chapter.) Next, I review the skills training procedures discussed in Chapter 11 of the main text. In the context of DBT as a whole, skills training procedures constitute one of four sets of change procedures; the other three are contingency, exposure-based, and cognitive modification procedures. Skills training procedures, as their name suggests, will be the \"meat\" of interventions in psychosocial skills training. However-and this is important-it is impossible to do a competent job in skills training without an understanding of how to make contingencies work in psychotherapy (contingency procedures), how to manage exposure to threatening material and situations (exposure-based procedures), and how to deal with maladaptive expectancies, assumptions, and beliefs (cognitive modification procedures). In most senses, these procedures cannot be pulled apart from the implementation of skills training procedures; I do so here and in the text only for the sake of exposition. (I briefly 27 28 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER review the application of these procedures to psychosocial skills training in the next chapter.) Structural Strategies Structural strategies have to do with how DBT as a whole is started and ended, as well as how individual skills training sessions are begun and ended. They also have to do with how time is structured during treatment and during individual sessions. There are five sets of structural strategies: (1) contracting strategies, (2) sessionbeginning strategies, (3) targeting strategies, (4) session ending strategies, and (5) terminating strategies. These are discussed in detail in Chapter 14 of the text. Contracting Strategies There are six specific contracting strategies: (1) conducting pretreatment assessment; (2) presenting the biosocial theory of borderline behavior patterns and the role of skills in these behaviors; (3) orienting the client(s) to specifics of skills training; (4) developing a collaborative commitment to do psychosocial skills training together, (5) assessing specific skill deficits, and (6) beginning to develop a therapeutic relationship. All of these steps should be gone through on two occasions: During initial individual interviews with each client before she is admitted to skills training, and during the first session of each skills training module. In addition, as in individual DBT, therapists can expect to repeat many of the strategies over and over as treatment progresses. Pretreatment Individual Session All potential members of a skills trammg program, whether it is conducted individually or in a group, should have one or more meetings with the skills training therapist (and the coleader, in the case of a group) to decide together whether skills training is appropriate and, if so, what form the training should take. Such a session should begin with reasonably thorough assessment (the first strategy listed above), including diagnostic interviewing as needed, at least to assess BPD. The session should also include some assessment of the individual\\'s psychosocial skills, as necessary (the fifth strategy above); this can be done either informally or formally using structured behavioral assessments. Following assessment, the therapist should briefly present the biosocial theory of BPD (the second strategy above), which is discussed briefly in Chapter 1 of this manual and in detail in Chapter 2 of the text. In the standard DBT program, these three steps will have been covered as part of acceptance into the total treatment and do not need to be repeated in full in this individual meeting. It is very important, however, to go through the other three strategies, even if they have already been covered by intake persom:iel or other members of the treatment team. The individual pretreatment interview should orient the client to specifics of skills training (the third strategy listed above)-how the group (if there is a group) will function, and the client\\'s role as well as the therapist\\'s in treatment. I discuss orienting to skills training in more detail later in this chapter. The therapist should also decide whether skills training, either individually or in group therapy, appears appropriate.for this client, and if so should make a commitment to ac: cepting this client (the fourth strategy above). Most important, the therapist should follow all of the DBT guidelines on obtaining an initial therapy commitment; these are outlined and discussed in Chapters 9 and 14 of the text. This point cannot be over-stressed. It is impossible to get too much commitment! The skills trainer should not assume that other therapists (e.g., the individual psychotherapist or the intake interviewer in a clinic setting) have gotten the commitment needed. The pretreatment session is also a good opportunity to begin developing a personal therapeutic relationship with the client (the sixth strategy;. see Chapters 14 and 15 of the text for more on this topic). First Skills Training Session The first session of skills training has been discussed in Chapter 3 of this manual; it is also outlined (including what to say, etc.) in Chapter 6. As those chapters indicate, the third, fourth and sixth contracting strategies discussed above are repeated in the first skills training session. Furthermore, in group psychosocial skills training, the group leaders should get commitments from the group as a whole as well as public commitments from each individual member. The rationale here is that public commitments are more powerful than private commitments. All of the commitment strategies outlined in Chapter 9 of the text should be employed. Session-Beginning and Session-Ending Strategies How to begin and end skills training sessions has been discussed in Chapter 3 of this manual and is also outlined in Chapter 6. The principles here are the same as in individual DBT, although the attention to ending sessions appropriately is much more structured in group skills training than in individual psychotherapy. A therapist who is conducting skills training individually should follow the session-beginning and session-ending guidelines in Chapter 14 of the text, except that if there is a need to repair relationship difficulties at the beginStructural Strategies and Skills Training Procedures 29 ning of a session, only a limited amount of time should be spent at it. If possible, the therapist should help the client use her distress tolerance crisis survival strategies (see Chapter 10 of this manual) to distract from the need for further repair, do skills training, and get back to repair at the next individual psychotherapy meeting. Terminating Strategies It is very important to remember that terminating a I-year psychosocial skills training program even in a group context, can be just as difficult for clients and therapists alike as terminating an intense, individual psychotherapy relationship. This can be very easy to forget. On the surface, at least, it may not appear that the attachment is as strong in group skills training. In myexperience, at least, people who are more familiar with individual therapy than with group therapy tend to underestimate the degree of attachment group members have to one another, to the group as a whole, and to the group leaders. Therapists must be careful to pay as much attention to terminating in skills training as they do in other types of therapy, such as individual psychotherapy. All the termination strategies outlined in Chapter 14 of the text should be used. Steps for terminating skills training modules are outlined in Chapter 6 of this manual. Targeting Strategies The DBT targeting strategies have to do with how time is structured during skills training sessions and what topics receive attention. They were developed to reflect the DBT emphasis on hierarchical organization of treatment targets and to insure that therapists attend to the hierarchical ordering necessary in DBT. Implementing the targeting strategies requires an integration of almost all the DBT treatment strategies. It can be extremely difficult in the first stage of DBT (see Chapter 6 of the text for a discussion of stages), because often both clients and therapists do not want to attend to skills training. Work on the therapeutic process, having \"heart-to-heart\" talks, resolving real-life crisis, and so forth can all be more reinforcing (for both therapists and clients) than the sometimes mundane task of working on general psychosocial skills. The rationale for the targeting strategies, and various objections to and difficulties with them, are discussed quite extensively in Chapters 5 and 6 of the text. It bears repeating here, however, that a therapist who ignores the targeting strategies is not doing DBT skills training. That is, in DBT what is discussed is as important as how it is discussed. Difficulties getting the client to go along with the targeting strategies should be treated as problems to be solved (see discussion of the therapyinterfering behavior protocol in Chapter 15 of the text). A therapist who is having trouble following the targeting strategies, (a not unlikely problem) should bring up the topic in the next supervision/consultation team meeting. (Chapter 13 of the text discusses the role of such meetings in DBT.) Because I have already discussed the rationale for targeting at such length in the text, I do not go through it again here. Skills training targets are, in order of importance: (1) stopping behaviors very likely to destroy therapy, (2) skill acquisition, and strengthening and generalization, and (3) reducing therapy-interfering behaviors. Target priorities indicate what is most important to address during sessions; in effect, they set the agenda. The agenda for skill acquisition, strengthening, the generalization is outlined in Chapters 6-10 of this manual. Although this agenda is the impetus for skills training in the first place, it must be set aside when behaviors emerge that are likely to destroy the treatment, either for a specific person or (in a group context) for the group as a whole. In contrast to DBT individual psychotherapy, however, behaviors that slow down progress in therapy (rather than threaten to destroy it altogether) are last rather than second in the hierarchy. A comparison of this hierarchy with the hierarchy for DBT as a whole and for individual psychotherapy (described in Chapters 5 and 6 of the text) indicates the role of skills training in the total scheme of things. A therapist who is conducting both the individual psychotherapy and skills training for a particular client must be very clear about which targets take priority in which treatment modes. Maintaining the distinction between modes is one of the keys to successful DBT. . Stopping Behaviors Likely to Destroy Therapy The highest-priority target is stopping client behaviors that, when and if they occur, pose a serious threat to the continuation of therapy. The behavior has to be very serious to be considered this high in priority. The emphasis here is a simple matter of logic: If therapy is destroyed, other targets cannot be achieved. The object here is to maintain the skills training sessions. Included in this target are violent behaviors, such as throwing objects, pounding loudly or destructively on things, and hitting or verbally attacking Other clients during group therapy sessions. (Verbal attacks on the therapists are not considered therapy-destroying behavior.) Parasuicidal acts (e.g., cutting or scratching wrists, picking off scabs so that bleeding starts, taking excessive medications) and suicide crisis behaviors (e.g., threatening suicide in a credible manner and then storming out of the session) during group sessions (including breaks) are also 30 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER not allowed. Also included are behaviors that make it impossible for anyone to concentrate, focus, or hear what is going on (e.g., yelling, hysterical crying, loud moaning, or constant out-of-turn talking). At times, an interpersonal problem among group members or between members and leaders, or a structural problem in the way skills training is delivered, may be so serious that if it is not attended to skills training will fall apart. Or one member may not be able to come back to skills training because of an interpersonal clash, hurt feelings, exces5ive hopelessness, or the like. In these cases, repairing the problem should be targeted. A therapist may attend to an individual problem by phone between sessions or before or after sessions, if not in the session itself. When we had a suicide in one of our groups, we dropped the skills acquisition agenda for the next several weeks to process group members\\' feelings about the suicide. Finally, a united rebellion of the clients against the therapists is also considered a top-priority target (as is a rebellion of the therapists against the clients). The skills trainer\\'s goal is to stop therapy-destructive behaviors and resolve rips in the therapeutic fabric as quickly and as efficiently as possible. Any further work on the destructive behaviors is left for the individual or primary psychotherapist to handle. (Behaviors that interfere with any mode of DBT treatment are considered therapy-interfering behaviors from the point of view of the DBT individual therapist.) Although teaching clients interpersonal effectiveness, emotion regulation, distress tolerance, or mindfulness skills may be useful in reducing the destructive behavior, a number of other treatment strategies (e.g., utilization of aversive contingencies) may be necessary to bring these behaviors under control quickly. When suicide crisis behaviors occur (which by definition suggest a high likelihood of impending suicide), skills training therapists do the absolute minimum crisis intervention necessary and then as quickly as possible turn the problem over to the individual therapist. Except to determine whether medical care is needed immediately, reports of previous parasuicidal acts are given almost no attention by skills trainers. \"Remember to tell your therapist;\\' is the modal response. The one exception, as noted above, is when these behaviors in a group context become destructive to continuation of therapy for other group members. They are then targeted directly in the skills training group sessions. The general principle is that all therapists other than the individual psychotherapist treat a client in a suicidal crisis like a student who gets deathly ill in school. The nearest relative (in this case, the individual therapist) is called. A skills trainer who is also the individual client\\'s therapist should turn the problem over to himself or herself, so to speak, after the skills training session. Unless it is impossible to do otherwise, skills training should not be interrupted to attend to suicidal crisis. Attention to suicidal ideation and communications during skills training is limited to helping the client figure out how to apply the DBT skills currently being taught to the suicidal feelings and thoughts. During mindfulness training, the focus may be on observing and describing the urge to engage in parasuicide or thoughts of suicide as these come and go. During distress tolerance training, the emphasis may be on tolerating the pain or using crisis intervention skills to cope with the situation. During emotion regulation training, the focus may be on observing, describing, and trying to change the emotions related to suicidal urges. In an interpersonal effectiveness framework, the emphasis may be on saying no or asking for help skillfully. The same strategy is used when the client discusses life crises, problems interfering with the quality of her life, or previous traumatic events in her life. Everything is grist for the skill application mill, so to speak. Skill Acquisition, Strengthening, and Generalization With very few exceptions, most of skills training time is devoted to acquisition, strengthening, and generalization of the DBI\\' psychosocial skills: core mindfulness skills, distress tolerance, emotional regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness. Even when therapy-destructive behaviors are occurring, the best strategy at times is to ignore them and focus resolutely no matter what on teaching the skills in the module at hand; this is almost always the strategy employed with the less serious therapy-interfering behaviors. Active practice and use of behavioral skills are extremely difficult for borderline individuals since these require them to move out of their active-passivity pattern. Thus, if passive behavior is followed either by a group leader\\'s shifting attention to another member (in a group context) or by a discussion of how the client is feeling or why she doesn\\'t want to participate, this risks reinforcing the very behavior (passivity) that skills training is intended to reduce. At times, trainers can simply drag clients through difficult moments in skills training; such an approach, however, requires that the trainers be very sure of their behavioral assessments. The key point is that such an approach should be strategic rather than simply insensitive. Therapy-Interfering Behaviors Behaviors that interfere with therapy, but do not destroy it, are not ordinarily addressed systematically in skills training. This decision is based primarily on the fact that if therapy-interfering behaviors were a high priority target, trainers might never get around to the desigStructural Strategies and Skills Training Procedures 31 nated skills training. Skills training does not address the therapy process itself, except as the process is an avenue for teaching and practicing the skills being taught. Un~ less they threaten to destroy the therapy altogether or offer a particularly good opportunity for practicing the skills currently being taught, therapy~interfering behaviors are generally ignored. At most, these behaviors are commented on in a way that communicates the desirability of change, while at the same time letting the client know that very little time can be devoted to problems unrelated to the skills being taught. Thus, mood-dependent passivity, restlessness, pacing around the room, doodling, sitting in odd positions, attempts to discuss the week\\'s crisis, oversensitivity to criticism, or anger at other clients will be ignored at times. The client is treated (ingeniously, at times) as if she is not engaging in the dysfunctional behaviors. At other times, a skills trainer may instruct or urge such a client to try to apply her behavioral skills to the problem at hand. For example, a client who gets angry and threatens to leave may be instructed to try to practice her distress tolerance skills, or her anger management skills. A client who is withdrawn, dissociating, or overactive, may be urged to practice her mindfulness (attending to the activity of the moment) skills. The key point here is that if skills trainers allow skills training sessions to become focused on therapy process or clients\\' life crises, including suicidal behaviors and quality-oflife-interfering behaviors, then training in skills will be forfeited. As I have discussed in Chapter 3 of this manual, there is a is-minute wind-down period at the end of each skills training session. This time is an appropriate time to observe therapy-interfering behaviors-or, even more importantly, improvement in previous interfering behaviors. As long as everyone gets a chance to voice an observation, this time can be used as therapy process time. One of the advantages of an observing wind-down is that it provides a time and place for discussing behaviors that are interfering with therapy. (Cautions about th~s procedure ,are also discussed in Chapter 3.) Skills Training Targets and Diary Cords Like individual therapists, skills training therapists need to know about clients\\' behavioral progress (or lack of it) during the week between sessions. Several information-gathering approaches are used. First, on the back of the diary cards (Figure 4.1; see Chapter 6 of the text for a description of diary cards) are listed a number of the most important skills taught in the skills training segment of the therapy. Next to each skill is a space for recording whether or not the client actually practiced the skill during the week. The card is brought to skills training sessions each week. In addition, each skills training module has its own set of diary sheets; clients are given these as the need arises. The beginning of each skills training session is devoted to a individual review with each client of her efforts at practicing skills during the previous week. If the card is not brought in, or if the client reports no practice effon or skill application, then this is viewed as a problem in self-management and is analyzed and discussed as such. The problem should be framed in such a way that whatever skills are currently being taught can be applied. Behavioral Targets during Phone Calls In standard DBT, clients are told at the beginning of treatment that the only phone calls generally allowed to or from skills training therapists are to give or obtain information that cannot wait (e.g., to let a skills trainer know that a client is going to miss the next session). Calls to resolve interpersonal conflicts of such magnitude that the client does not feel she can come to another session if the conflict is not resolved before the next session are also appropriate. The reason for this limitation is that when skills training is conducted in groups (as in our program), skills trainers can be overwhelmed with calls if they are willing to accept calls from all group members. In addition, the focus of a group leader on the individual as part of a group can be a difficult context to break, especially when an unexpected phone call requires an immediate shifting of context. Thus, the rationale is based on observing one\\'s limits as a group therapist. Skills Training Procedures During skills training, and more generally throughout DBT, therapists must insist at every opportunity that the clients actively engage in the acquisition and practice of skills needed to cope with life as it is. In other words, they must directly, forcefully, and repeatedly challenge borderline individuals\\' passive problem-solving style. The procedures described below are applied by every DBT therapist across all modes of treatment where appropriate. They are applied in a formal way in the structured skills training modules. There are three types of skills training procedures: (1) skill acquisition (e.g., instructions, modeling), (2) skill strengthening (e.g., behavioral rehearsal, feedback), and (3) skill generalization (e.g., homework assignments, discussion of similarities and differences in situations). In skill acquisition, a therapist is teaching new behaviors. In skill strengthening and generalization the therapist is trying both to fine-tune skilled behaviors and to increase Nam Dialectical Behavior Therapy DIARY CARD Ic.._ _\": ___ I_D_3te_It_lII\\'ted\\'Date Mon , Alcohol $pIdfy O....rtIuI Countsr ...dlcatlons I SPlcl\\'y Pre.crlptlon M.dlcatlon., I SPicIfy I StrtI illicit Drull\\' SPielfy Sulcld8I Idudoft (0-1) Ml...., (0-6) ...,-H_ UrO\" Actloll \\'0.&1 V..INo U .,d Skill.

Structural Strategies and Skills Training Procedures 3J the probability that the person will use the skilled behaviors already in her repertoire in relevant situations. Skill strengthening and skill generalization, in turn, require the application of contingency procedures, exposure, and/or cognitive modification. That is, once the therapist is sure that a particular response pattern is within the client\\'s current repertoire, then other procedures are applied to increase the client\\'s effective behaviors in everyday life. It is this emphasis on active, self-conscious teaching, typical of behavioral and cognitive therapies, that differentiates OBT from many psychodynamic approadles to treating borderline clients. Some skills training procedures, however, are virtually identical to those used in supportive psychotherapy. The targets of skills training are determined by the parameters of OBT; the emphasis on certain skills over others is determined by behavioral analysis in each individual case. Orienting and Committing to Skills Training: Task Overview Orienting is a skills trainer\\'s chief means of selling the new behaviors as worth learning and OBT procedures as likely to work. Skills training can only be accomplished if a person actively collaborates with the treatment program. Some clients both have skill deficits and are fearful about acquiring the new skills. It can be useful to point out here that learning a new skill does not mean actually having to use the skill. That is, a person can acquire a skill and then choose in each situation whether to use it or not. Sometimes clients do not want to learn new skills because they feel hopeless that anything will really help. I find it useful to point out that the skills I am teaching have helped either me or others that I know. However, a skills trainer cannot prove ahead of time that particular skills will actually help a given individual. Before teaching any new skill, the trainer should give an overall rationale (or draw it in Socratic fashion from the client) for why the particular skill or set of skills might be useful. At times this may only require a comment or two; at other times it may require extensive discussion. At some point the skills trainer should also explain the rationale for his or her methods of teaching-that is, a rationale for the OBT skills training procedures. The most important point to make here, and to repeat as often as needed, is that learning new skills requires practice, practice, practice. Equally importantly, practice has to occur in situations where the skills are needed. If these points do not get through to a client, there is not much hope that she will actually learn anything new. Skill Acquisition Skill acquisition procedures are concerned with remediating skill deficits. OBT does not assume that all, or even most, of a borderline person\\'s problems are motivational in nature. Instead, the bias is toward assessing the extent of the person\\'s abilities in a particular area; skill acquisition procedures are then used if skill deficits exist. At times, in lieu of other means of assessment, the therapist employs skill acquisition procedures and then observes any consequent change in behavior. A Note on Assessing Abilities It can be very difficult with borderline clients to know whether they are incapable of doing something or are capable but emotionally inhibited or constrained by environmental factors. Although this is a complex assessment question with any client population, it can be particularly hard with borderline individuals because of their inability to analyze their own behavior and abilities. For example, they often confuse being afraid of doing something with not being able to do it. In addition, there are often powerful contingencies mitigating against their admitting having any behavioral capabilities. (I have reviewed many of these in Chapter 10 in the text.) Clients may say that they do not know how they feel or what they think, or that they can\\'t find words, when in reality they are afraid of expressing the thoughts and feelings. As many of them say, they often do not want to be vulnerable. Some clients have been taught by their families and therapists to view all of their problems as motivationally based, and have either bought that story entirely (and thus believe they can do anything, but just do not want to) or have rebelled completely (and thus never entertain the possibility that motivational factors might be as important as ability-related factors). These therapy dilemmas are discussed more fully in the next chapter. Some therapists respond to clients\\' statements that they can\\'t do anything with an equally polarized .statement that they can if only theywant to. Failing to behave skillfully, and claiming not to know how to behave differently, are viewed as resistant (or at least as determined by motives outside awareness). Giving advice, coaching, making suggestions, or otherwise teaching new behaviors is seen as encouraging dependency and need gratification that gets in the way of \"real\" therapy. Other therapists, of course, fall into the trap of believing that clients can-hardly do anything. At times they even go so far as to believe that the clients are incapable of learning new, more skillful behaviors. Acceptance, nurturance, and environmental intervention compromise the armamentarium of these therapists. Not surprising34 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER ly, when these two orientations coexist within a client\\'s treatment team, conflict and \"staff splitting\" often arise. A dialectical approach would suggest looking for the synthesis, as I discussed more fully in Chapter 13 of the text. To assess whether a behavioral pattern is within a client\\'s repertoire, the skills trainer has to figure out a way to create ideal circumstances for her to produce the behavior. For interpersonal behaviors, an approximation to this is role playing during the skills training sessionor, if the client refuses, asking her to indicate what she would say in a particular situation. Alternatively, one client can be asked to coach another during a role play. I am frequently amazed to find that individuals who appear very interpersonally skilled cannot put together reasonable responses in certain role-play situations, whereas individuals who seem passive, meek and unskilled are quite capable of responding skillfully if the role play can be made comfortable enough. In analyzing distress tolerance, the trainer can ask what techniques the client uses or thinks helpful in tolerating difficult or stressful situations. Emotion regulation can sometimes be assessed by interrupting an exchange and asking the client to see whether she can change her emotional state. Self-management and mindfulness skills can be analyzed by observing the client\\'s behavior in sessions, especially when she is not the focus of attention, and questioning her about her day-to-day behavior. If the client produces a behavior, the skills trainer knows she has it in her repertoire. However, if she does not, the trainer cannot be sure; as in statistics, there is no way to test the null hypothesis. When in doubt, it is usually safer to proceed with skill acquisition procedures, just in case. Generally, there is no harm in doing so and most of the procedures also affect other factors related to skilled behavior. For example, both instructions and modeling (the principal skill acquisition procedures; see below) may work also because they give the individual \"permission\" to behave, and thus reduce inhibitions, rather than because they add to the individual\\'s behavioral repertoire. Instructions Instructions are verbal descriptions of the response components to be learned. They can vary from general guidelines (\"When restructuring your thinking, be sure to check out the probability that the dire consequences will occur;\\' \"Think reinforcement\") to very specific suggestions as to what the client should do (\"The minute an urge hits, go get an ice cube and hold it in your hand for 10 minutes\") or think (\"Keep saying over and over to yourself, \\'I can do it\\' \"). Especially in a group setting, they can be presented in a lecture format with a blackboard as an aid. Instructions can be suggested as hypotheses to be considered, can be set forth as thesis and antithesis to be synthesized, or can be drawn out in a Socratic method of discourse. In all cases, a therapist must be careful not to oversimplify the ease of behaving effectively or of learning the skill. The skills training hand-outs in the back of this book provide written instructions. Modeling Modeling can be provided by therapists, other clients, other people in a client\\'s environment, audiotapes, videotapes, films, or printed material. Any procedure that provides the client with examples of appropriate alternative responses is a form of modeling. The advantage of a skills trainer\\'s providing the modeling is that the situation and materials can be tailored to fit a particular client\\'s needs. There are a number of ways to model skilled behavior. In-session role playing (with the skills trainer as a participant) can be used to demonstrate appropriate interpersonal behavior. When events between a trainer and the client arise that are similar to events the client encounters in her natural environment, the trainer can model handling such situations in effective ways. The skills trainer can also use self-talk (speaking aloud) to model coping self-statements, self-instructions, or restructuring of problematic expectations and beliefs. For example, the trainer may say, \"OK, here\\'s what I would say to myself: \\'I\\'m overwhelmed. What\\'s the first thing I do when overwhelmed? Break down the situation into steps and make a list. Do the first thing on the list: \" Telling stories, relating historical events, or providing allegorical examples (see Chapter 7 of the text) can often be useful in demonstrating alternative life strategies. Finally, self-disclosure can be used to model adaptive behavior, especially if a skills trainer has encountered problems in living similar to those a client is currently encountering. This tactic is discussed at length in Chapter 12 of the text, and careful attention to the guidelines listed there is recommended. All of the modeling techniques describes above, of course, can also be used in a group context by members in modeling for one another. The ideal is for one group member to demonstrate in front of the whole group how to handle a situation skillfully. The more comfortable group members are with one another and with the group leader, the easier it is to induce them to act as models. Humor and flattery can be great aids here. In addition to in-session modeling, it can be useful to have clients observe the behavior and responses of competent people in their own environment. The behaviors that they observe can then be discussed in sesStructural Strategies and Skills Training Procedures 35 sions and practiced by everyone. The skills training handouts provide models of how to use specific skills. Biographies, autobiographies, and novels about people who have coped with similar problems provide new ideas as well. It is always important to discuss with the clients any behaviors modeled by the skills trainers or other clients, or presented as models outside of therapy, to be sure that the client is observing the relevant responses. Skill Strengthening Once skilled behavior has been acquired, skill strengthening is used to shape, refine, and increase the likelihood of their use. Without reinforced practice, a skill cannot be learned; this point cannot be emphasized too much, since skill practice is effortful behavior and directly counteracts borderline individuals\\' tendencies to employ a passive behavior style. Behavioral Rehearsal Behavioral rehearsal is any procedure in which a client practices responses to be learned. This can be done in interactions with therapists or other clients, and in simulated or in vivo situations. Any skilled behaviors-verbal sequences, nonverbal actions, patterns of thinking or cognitive problem solving, and some components of physiological and emotional responses-can, in principle, be practiced. Practice can be either overt or covert. Various forms of overt behavioral rehearsal are possible. For example, in a group context, group members may role-play (together or with the leaders) problematic situations, so that each member can practice responding appropriately. To learn to control physiological responses, clients may practice relaxing during a session. In learning cognitive skills, each client may be asked to verbalize effective self-statements. In the specific case of cognitive restructuring, clients may be asked to first examine and verbalize any dysfunctional beliefs, rules, or possible expectancies elicited by the problem situation, and then to restructure these beliefs by generating more useful coping statements, rules, or the like. In group sessions, they can do this in writing (on handouts provided for this purpose) and then share what they have written with the group. Covert response practice-that is, practicing the requisite response in imagination-may also be an effective form of skill strengthening. It may be more effective than overt methods for teaching more complex cognitive skills, and it is also useful when a client refuses to engage in overt rehearsal. Clients can be asked to practice emotion regulation; generally, however, \"emotional behavior\" cannot be practiced directly. That is, clients cannot practice getting angry, feeling sad, or experiencing joy. Instead, they have to practice specific components of emotions (changing facial expressions, generating thoughts that elicit or inhibit emotions, changing muscle tension, etc.). In my experience, borderline individuals rarely like behavioral rehearsal, especially when it is done in front of others. Thus, a fair amount of cajoling and shaping is needed. If a client won\\'t role-play an interpersonal situation, for example, a skills trainer can try talking her through a dialogue (\"Then what could you say?\"), or can try practicing just part of a new skill so that the client is not overwhelmed. The essence of the message here, though, is that in order to be different, people must practice acting differently. Some therapists do not like behavioral rehearsal either, especially when it requires them to role-play with the clients. For therapists who feel shy or uncomfortable, the best solution is for them to practice role playing with members of the supervision/consultation team. At other times, therapists resist role playing because they do not want to push rehearsal on clients. These therapists may not be aware of the wealth of data indicating that behavioral rehearsal is related to therapeutic improvement (e.g., Linehan, Goldfried, & Goldfried, 1979). Response Reinforcement Therapist reinforcement is one of the most powerful mean of shaping and strengthening skilled behavior in borderline and suicidal individuals. Frequently, such persons have lived in environments that overuse punishment. They often expect negative, punishing feedback from the world in general and their therapists in particular, and apply self-punishing strategies almost exclusively in trying to shape their own behavior. Over the long run, skill reinforcement by therapists can modify the clients\\' selfimage in a positive manner, increase their use of skilled behavior, and enhance their sense that they can control positive outcomes in their lives. One of the benefits of group therapy over individual therapy is that when a group leader actively and obviously reinforces a skilled behavior in one group member, the same behavior among all other group members (if they are attending) is vicariously reinforced. In other words, this provides \"more bang for the buck:\\' Moreover, group therapy can be very powerful when group members become adept at reinforcing skilled behaviors in one another. The techniques of providing appropriate reinforcement are discussed extensively in Chapter 10 of the text. Those principles are very important and should be reviewed thoroughly. Here, however, it is important to point out that skills trainers have to stay alert and notice client behaviors that represent improvement, even if these make the trainers rather uncomfortable. Teaching clients interpersonal skills to use with their parents, 36 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER and then punishing or ignoring those same skills when used in a training session, for example, is not therapeutic. Encouraging clients to think for themselves, but then punishing or ignoring them when they disagree with a trainer, is not therapeutic. Stressing that \"not fitting in\" in all circumstances is not a disaster and that distress can be tolerated, and then not tolerating clients when they do not fit comfortably into a trainer\\'s schedule or preconceived notions of how borderline individuals act, is not therapeutic. Feedback and Coaching Response feedback is the provision of information to clients about their performance. Feedback should pertain to performance, not to the motives presumably leading to the performance. This point is very important. One of the unfortunate factors in the lives of many borderline individuals is that people rarely give them feedback about their behavior that is uncontaminated with interpretations about their ptesumed motives and intent. When the presumed motives do not fit, the individuals often discount or are distracted from the valuable feedback they may be getting about their behavior. Feedback should be behaviorally specific; that is, a skills trainer should tell the client exactly what she is doing that seems to indicate either continuing problems or improvement. Telling clients that they are manipulating, expressing a need to control, overreacting, clinging, or acting out is simply not helpful if there are not clear behavioral referents for the terms. This is, of course, especially true when a trainer has pin-pointed a problem behavior correctly but is making inaccurate motivational inferences. Many arguments between clients and therapists arise out of just this inaccuracy. The role and use of interpretation in DBT are discussed extensively in Chapter 9 of the text. A skills trainer must attend closely to a client\\'s behavior (within sessions or self-reported) and select those responses on which to give feedback. At the beginning of training, the client may do little that appears competent; the trainer is usually well advised at this point to give feedback on a limited number of response components, even though other deficits could be commented upon. Feedback on more may lead to stimulus overload and/or discouragement about the rate of progress. A response shaping paradigm (discussed in Chapter 10 of the text) should be used, with feedback, coaching, and reinforcement designed to encourage successive approximations to the goal of effective performance. Borderline individuals often desperately want feedback about their behavior, but at the same time are sensitive to negative feedback. The solution here is to surround negative feedback with positive feedback. Treating clients as too fragile to deal with negative feedback does them no favor. An important part of feedback is giving clients information about the effects of their behavior on their therapists; this is discussed more extensively in Chapter 12 of the text. Coaching is combining feedback with instructions. It is telling the client how a response is discrepant from the criterion of skilled performance and how it might be improved. Clinical practice suggests that the \"permission\" to behave in certain ways that is implicit in coaching may sometimes b.e all that is needed to accomplish changes in behavior. Skill Generalization DBT does not assume that skills learned in therapy will necessarily generalize to situations in everyday life outside of therapy. Therefore, it is very important that skills trainers actively encourage this transfer of skills. Although skill generalization is the primary responsibility of the primary or individual psychotherapist (because of time limitations in skills training therapy), there are a number of specific procedures that skills trainers can use as well. Between-Session Consultation If they are unable to apply new skills in their natural environment, clients should be encouraged to get consultation from their individual psychotherapists and from one another between sessions. Skills trainers can give these individuals lessons on how to provide appropriate coaching. On inpatient and day treatment units, clients can be encouraged to seek assistance from staff members when they are having difficulty. Another technique, developed by Charles Swenson at Cornell Medical Center/New York Hospital at White Plains and mentioned in Chapter 2 of this manual, is to provide a unit behavioral consultant with regular office hours. The consultant\\'s task is to help clients apply their new skills to everyday life. Review of Session Tapes If possible, skills training sessions should be videotaped. The videotapes can then be reviewed by client between sessions if there is a room available where they can come and watch tapes. There are several reasons for the tape monitoring strategy. First, because of substance abuse prior to sessions, high emotional arousal during sessions, dissociation or other concentration difficulties accompanying depression and anxiety, clients ate often unable to attend to much of what transpires during a skills training session. Thus, the patients may improve their retention of material offered during the session by viewing the videotape. Second, a client may gain important insights from viewing herself and her interactions with others. Such insights often help the client understand and Structural Strategies and Skills Training Procedures 37 improve her own interpersonal skills. Third, many clients report that coming in to watch a skills training tape can be very helpful when they are feeling overwhelmed, panicked, or unable to cope between sessions. Simply watching a tape, especially if they can find one of a session where a needed skill was taught, has an effect similar to that of having an additional session. Skills trainers should encourage, but not require or demand, use of the tapes for these purposes. In Vivo Behavioral. Rehearsal Assignments In structured skills trailling, homework assignments are keyed to the specific behavioral skills currently being taught. It is advantageous if a skills trainer or a client can also get the client\\'s individual psychotherapist to use some of the homework assignments and accompanying forms throughout therapy, or on an as-needed basis. This is always done in standard DBT. For example, one of the structured homework forms focuses on identifying and labeling emotions and takes the client through a series of steps to help her clarify what she is feeling. The individual therapist may suggest that the client use this form whenever she is confused or overwhelmed by emotions. At the back of this manual are a number of homework assignment sheets, covering each of the DBT behavioral skills. There is no reason, of course, why skills trainers and individual therapists cannot revise these forms to fit either their clients\\' or their own personal preferences and needs. Creating on Environment That Reinforces Skilled Behavior As I discuss in Chapter 3 of the text, borderline individuals tend to have a passive style of personal regulation. On the continuum whose poles are internal self-regulation and external environmental regulation, they are near the environmental pole. Many therapists seem to believe that the self-regulation pole of the continuum is inherently better or more mature, and spend a fair amount of therapy time trying to make borderline individuals more self-regulated. Although DBT does not suggest the converse-that environmental regulation styles are preferable-it does suggest that going with the clients\\' strength is likely to be easier and more beneficial in the long run. Thus, once behavioral skills are in place, clients should be taught how to maximize the tendency of their natural environments to reinforce skilled over unskilled behaviors. This may include teaching them how to create structure, how to make public instead of private commitments, how to find communities and lifestyles that support their new behaviors, and how to elicit reinforcement from others for skilled rather than unskilled behaviors. This is not to say that clients should not be taught self-regulation skills; rather, the types of selfregulation skills taught should be keyed to their strengths. Written self-monitoring with a prepared diary form, for example, is preferable over trying to observe behavior each day and make a mental note of it. Keeping alcohol out of the house is preferable to trying a selftalk strategy to inhibit getting out the bottle. A final point needs to be made here. Sometimes clients\\' newly learned skills do not generalize because out in the real world they punish their own behavior. This is usually because their behavioral expectations for themselves are so high that they simply never reach the criterion for reinforcement. This pattern must change if generalization and progress are to occur. Problems with self-reinforcement and self-punishment are discussed more extensively in Chapters 3, 8, and 10 of the text; the behavioral validation strategies described in Chapter 8 should be used in skills training as well. I discuss these topics further in the skills module content chapters of this manual (7-10). Family and Couples Sessions. One way to maximize generalization is to have individuals from the client\\'s social community come to sessions. Usually, these will be members of the clients\\' families or their spouses or partners. Perry Hoffman, of Cornell Medical Center/New York Hospital at White Plains has developed a form of family therapy in which borderline clients and members of their families are brought together as a group. The same skills modules used with the borderline clients without their families present are then retaught with their families present. Thus, all members of the family are learning the same sets of skills. Since the borderline clients are usually a lesson or two ahead of their families, they can assist in teaching family members the DBT behavioral skills. Family members of borderline clients have been very receptive to this type of therapy. Principles of Fading. At the beginning of skills training, the therapist models, instructs, reinforces, gives feedback, and coaches the client for using skills both within the therapy sessions and in her natural environment. If skillful behavior in the everyday environment is to become independent of the influence of the therapist, however, then the therapist must gradually fade out his or her use of these procedures, particularly instructions and reinforcement. The goal here is to fade skills training procedures to an intermittent schedule, such that the therapist is providing less frequent instructions and coaching than the client can provide for herself, and less modeling, feedback, and reinforcement than the client is obtaining from her natural environment. 5 Application of Other Strategies and Procedures to Psychosocial Skills Training \\'he major strategies and procedures in DBT are discussed in detail in the text accompanying this manual. This chapter is along the lines of \"OK, if you know all that, here\\'s what else to think about when you apply it to skills training especially in a group setting.\" The text provides the rationale, theory, and caveats for each set of strategies and procedures; skills trainers need to know these in order to respond flexibly to new problems that arise. This chapter addresses some of the problems that may arise specifically in skills training and some of the modifications of strategies and procedures I have found useful, particularly in a group context. Dialectical Strategies As noted in the Chapter 7 of the text, the dialectical focus in DBT occurs at two levels of therapeutic behavior. At the first level, a therapist must be alert to the dialectical balance occurring within the treatment environment. In a group setting, each group member, (including each leader) is in a constant state of dialectical tension at many levels and in many directions. The first set of tensions consists of the tensions between each individual member and the group as a whole. From this perspective, the group has an identity of its own, and each member can react to the group as a whole. Thus, for example, a member may be acting in dialectical tension with group norms, group beliefs or attitudes, or group \"personality.\" In addition, insofar as the identity of the group as a whole is both the sum of and more than its parts, the identity of each individual in the group is in some aspect defined by her relationship to the group. Because both the identity of the group and the identity of each individual change over the year, identification of members with the group and the struggles that evolve with this identity provide a dialectical tension that can be harnessed for the sake of therapeutic progress. A second set of tensions consists of those between each individual pair within the group -tensions that can become active at any moment when two group members interact. A drawback of allowing members to interact with one another outside of the group is that relationships between members can develop outside of the public arena of the group. Thus, the dialectical tensions between one member and another will often not be apparent to the leaders or other group members. Overlaying and interfacing with these two levels, so to speak, is a third set of dialectical tensions between each individual and her unique environment-a context bought into the treatment situation via long term memory. The group leaders must be aware of the multiple tensions impinging on a skills training session at any given time. Maintaining a therapeutic balance and moving the balance toward reconciliation and growth are the tasks of the therapists. It is essential here that each therapist remember that he or she is also a group member and thus is also in dialectical tension with the group as a whole, with the other leader, and with each individual member. Clearly, the dialectical framework that is necessary 38 Other Strategies and Procedures 39 here is that of a dynamic, open system. The system includes not only those present but also all external influences that are brought into group sessions via long-term memory and established behavioral patterns. This framework will help the group leaders avoid the mistake of always interpreting members\\' behavior from the point of view of a closed system. The closed-system perspective assumes that all responses are a direct reaction to events within sessions. It is far more common, however, for a group activity or event to precipitate the remembering of events that have occurred outside of sessions. Borderline clients are quite unable to put aside or stop cognitive processing of very stressful events, or ruminating, and focus on one thing in the moment. It is also a mistake, on the other hand, for the leaders never to attribute client behavior to in-session events. It is this dialectical tension between and among influential events that the leaders must be attuned to. The second level of dialectical focus is on teaching and modeling dialectical thinking as a replacement for dichotomous, either-or, black-and-white thinking. Techniques such as entering the paradox, storytelling and other uses of metaphor, extending, playing the devil\\'s advocate, activating \"wise mind;\\' making lemonade out of lemons, dialectical assessment, and allowing natural change are described in Chapter 7 of the text and are applicable to skills training. (I discuss specific applications of some of these techniques later.) The group setting, in particular, offers a rich environment for demonstrating the futility of approaching ptoblem solving with a \"right versus wrong\" cognitive set. No matter how brilliant a solution to a particular problem may be, it is always possible for another group member or for the member with the problem to come up with another strategy that may be equally effective. And every problem solution has its own set of limitations; that is, there is always \"another side of the story.\" It is extremely important that the group leaders not get into a battle of trying to prove that the skills being taught are the only right way to handle every situation, or even any particular situation. Although the skills may be very effective for some purposes, they are not more \"right\" than other approaches. Thus, the leaders\\' task is to ask this question repeatedly: \"How can we all be right, and how can we test the effectiveness of our strategies?\" A group also offers a unique opportunity to observe the process of change and development. It can be very difficult to see change and development in oneself; it is often easier to see it in another. The leaders\\' task here is to comment on the evolutionary process of both the group as a whole and of each individual, and to encourage members to begin observing the same phenomenon. Typical Dialectics Willingness versus Willfulness The tension between \"willingness\" and \"willfulness\" is an important one in treating borderline clients. Although I discuss it much more fully in Chapter 10 of this manual, the essential tension is between responding to a situation in terms of what the situation needs (willingness) and responding in a way that resists what a situation needs or responding in terms of one\\'s own needs rather than those of the situation (willfulness). Thus, willfulness encompasses both trying to \"fix\" the situation and sitting passively on one\\'s hands, refusing to respond at alL There are many forms of this tension in conducting skills training with borderline clients. A key one arises in a group context when the leaders are interacting with one member or the group as a whole, and the member or group is withdrawing and refusing to interact. The tension is between attempting to influence the member or group and allowing oneself to be influenced by the member or group. The essential question, framed somewhat more directly, is how far the leaders should push and how far the group member or group as a whole should resist. Use of the terms \"willfulness\" and \"willingness\" can be quite helpful in this dilemma. I have found myself on many occasions discussing with a client who is being willful-I, she, or both of us. Of course, the answer to the question revolves around what is needed in the situation, and it is at this point that skill becomes important. It is also, however, a matter of perspective or dialectical focus. The group leaders must keep in mind the member\\'s or group\\'s needs at the moment and in the long term, or current comfort versus future gain, and balance these respective goals. Ifthis balance is missed, then the leaders are in danger of being willful. It is all too easy to get into a power struggle with group members, in which the needs of the leaders to make progress, to feel effective, or to create a more comfortable atmosphere come into conflict with the needs of the members. The problem of willfulness versus willingness is nowhere more apparent than when a therapist is juggling the needs of an individual group member and those of the group as a whole. This most commonly occurs when one member is refusing to interact, is hostile, or otherwise is behaving in a way that influences the mood, comfort, and progress of the entire group. In my experience, such a threat to the group\\'s good can bring out in a therapist the tendency to be willfuL Generally, the tension here is between two types of willfulness. On the one hand, a therapist can be willful by actively controlling, and attacking the errant member or her behavior. Be40 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER cause group members are singularly unskilled at coping with negative affect, when one member creates conflict other group members withdraw. As the mood of the group becomes increasingly tense or hopeless, the therapist naturally wants to turn it around; thus, the attempt to control the member initiating the conflict ensues. In contrast the therapist can be equally willful by ignoring the conflict and tense mood and responding in a passive way. Passivity in this case actually masquerades as activity, since ignoring the tension is generally manifested by the therapist\\'s continuing to push and escalate the conflict. The synthesis of willfulness on each side is willingness. Willingness is a response that bal~nces the needs of the individual versus the needs of the group as a whole, and the needs of the moment versus the longterm benefits for the group. Unfortunately, no manual can pinpoint where this balance is in the individual case. \"Good Guy versus Bad Guy\" In a group setting, keeping group members working together collaboratively is often very hard work for the leaders. Variations in individual members\\' moods when they arrive for a session, as well as reactions to in-session events, can have a tremendous effect on any given individual\\'s willingness to work collaboratively during a particular group meeting. It is not untypical that an entire group may be \"out of the mood;\\' so to spea~ for working at a particular meeting. When this happens;the leaders must continue to interact with the group members in an attempt to get them working collaboratively again. However, this attempt to interact with the members is often viewed by the members as \"pushing;\\' and the leader doing the work is (usually, the primary group leader) viewed as the \"bad guy\" by the group members. At this point it is often helpful for the coleader to validate the group members\\' experience. As they are pushed by the primary leader, they often not only retreat but become more rigid in their refusal to interact. Validation from the coleader can reduce the negative affect and enhance their ability to work. When ihis occurs, however, the coleader may then be viewed as the \"good guy:\\' Thus the dialectical tension builds between the coleaders. This scenario is closely related to the psychodynamic concept of \"splitting.\" The danger is that the leaders will allow themselves to become \"split;\\' so to speak, acting as independent units rather than a cohesive whole. This is most likely to happen if either of the leaders begins to see his or her position as \"right\" and the other leader\\'s position as \"wrong:\\' Once this happens, the leaders pull away from one another and disturb the balance that might otherwise occur. This will not go unnoticed, because group members watch the relationship between the leaders closely. I often refer to group skills training as a recreation of family dinners. Most members have many experiences of unresolved conflicts and battles occurring at family dinners. Group skills training is an opportunity for members to experience a wholeness in the resolution of conflict. The leaders\\' ability to contain the dialectic in their relationship-to stay united and whole, even as they take different roles -is essential for this learning. Of course, being the \"good guy\" can be quite comfortable and being the \"bad guy\" can be quite uncomfortable. Thus, it takes some skillfulness and personal feelings of security for the primary leader to take the role of the \"bad guy:\\' (I should be careful to note here that it is not always the primary leader who is the \"bad guy:\\' At times, either leader can take this role.) Another dialectical tension that may build is that between the skills training leaders and the clients\\' individual psychotherapists. Here the skills trainers can either be the \"good guys\" or the \"bad guys;\\' and the individual therapists can play the corresponding role. In my experience, during the first year of DBT, the skills trainers are more often the \"bad guys\" and the individual therapists are the \"good guys\"; however, on occasion the roles are switched. In fact, this is one of the great assets of separating skills training from individual therapy in DBT: It allows a client to have a \"bad guy\" and a \"good guy\" simultaneously. Thus, the client is often able to tolerate staying in therapy more readily. The function of the \"good guy\" is often to hold the client in therapy while she resolves her conflicts with the >\"bad guy:\\' Most borderline individuals do not have the eXperience of staying in a painful relationship long enough to work a conflict out and then to experience the reinforcement of conflict resolution. DBT, therefore, offers perhaps a unique context in which this can be done. In a sense, a client always has a benign consultant to help her deal with her conflicts with the other therapist. The essential ingredient here, as should be obvious, is that whoever is the \"good guy\" must always be able to hold in mind the therapeutic relationships as a whole, rather than allowing them to resolve into \"right versus wrong\" and true \"good guy versus bad guy:\\' It is the therapists\\' ability to hold these relationships as a whole that will eventually allow their clients to learn to do the same. As the therapists model balance, clients will learn to balance themselves. Content versus Process As noted previously, process issues are not attended to systematically during group skills training except when negative process threatens to destroy the group. However, even when this threat emerges, it may be that borderOther Strategies and Procedures 41 line clients simply cannot process conflict in a group setting. (Even in individual skills training, if the relationship is intense, the skills trainer may not be able to resolve interpersonal issues promptly. Especially when the skills trainer is also the individual therapist, issues from individual psychotherapy sessions may spill over into the skills training). The tension that arises is between whether the group leaders should proceed with teaching content, even though members are passive, are hostile, don\\'t want to learn, are angry at one another, or feel rejected, and whether the leaders should stop and discuss the conflicts and dissatisfactions and attend to the process in the group. Attending to process is fraught with difficulties in the first year. In our clinic the group therapy program is a multiyear program; our experience is that borderline clients are not able to deal with group process before the second year of therapy. The first-year group wind-downs are the training ground for group process. More than a few minutes of process is often more than group members can handle. The danger here is that a conflict beginning in group sessions may not be resolved because members walk out or the sessions end. When this happens and the conflict is serious, the group leaders may need to spend considerable time talking with each member individually to help her work through the issues. Thus, if process is to be attended to, content may have to be dropped at least temporarily. On the other hand, if content alone is attended to without any attention to process, the group will break down eventually. Holding the balance between content and process, is essential. In my experience, some group leaders do better with content and find it easy to ignore process, whereas other group leaders do well with process and find it easy to ignore content. It is rare that a group leader will find achieving this critical balance an easy task. Perhaps the key here is recognizing the pull of borderline individuals toward making every moment they are in comfortable. Their inability to put discomfort on a shelf and attend to a task poses a formidable obstacle to continuing with content when process issues are in the foreground. We have found it necessary, however, time and again to forge ahead. Forging ahead generally requires the therapists to ignore some of the process issues and respond as if group members are collaborating even when they are not. It is a delicate balance that can only be mastered with experience. FollOWing the Rules versus Reinforcing Assertiveness As noted in Chapter 3 of this manual, DBT skills training has a number of rules. These rules are not unimportant, and some of them are unequivocal and unbendable. On the other hand, a primary target in DBT is teaching interpersonal skills, including the ability to assert oneself. A tension that arises over time, if skills trainers are doing their job well, is that between maintaining the rules (regardless of clients\\' assertions and requests to the contrary) and reinforcing clients\\' growing assertive skills by bending the rules when requested to in an appropriate manner. The ability to balance \"giving in\" and \"not giving in\" is essential. It is here that the trainers\\' attitude of compassionate flexibility must be balanced with unwavering centeredness (qualities discussed in Chapter 4 of the text). What is required is clear thinking on the part of the skills trainers. Giving in for the sake of giving in is as rigid as holding to rules for the sake of holding on. The simple fact that a client requests that a rule be bent or broken in an appropriate manner, however, is not sufficient for reward. Clearly, appropriate requests are not always met with a gracious response in the real world. In fact, one of the key misconceptions of borderline individuals is that if they ask appropriately, the world will (or should) always give them what they need or want. Learning to deal with the fact that this does not always happen is essential for growth and is one of the goals of distress tolerance training (see Chapter 10 of this manual). On the other hand, the attempt to teach this fundamental lesson should not be confused with arbitrary refusals to make exceptions when the situation requires it. Once again, the notion of willingness can be viewed as the synthesis, and thus as the path for the therapists to follow. Willingness, however, requires clarity on the skills trainers\\' part. The clarity needed has to do with the ultimate goals of therapy for an individual member (or for the group, in a group setting) and the means of achieving the goals. The tension thatinost often exists is that between current comfort aqd learning to deal with discomfort. Therapists must straddle these two aims in coming to a decision about what is the most effective response to a client\\'s assertive behavior. The task is much easier, of course, if the skills trainers can see emerging client assertiveness as progress rather than as a threat. This is often not very comfortable, because life becomes much more difficult for the trainers when clients begin interacting as peers rather than as \"patients:\\' The \"one up, one down\" relationship that so often exists in therapy is threatened as the clients make progress. To the extent that the skills trainers can take delight in the clients\\' emerging abilities to outreason, outlogic, and outmaneuver them, therapy progress will be enhanced and not threatened. Essential here in a group context, of course, is respecting the other group members\\' point of view. It is also essential for the trainers to recognize when they are up against a brick wall 42 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER and are not going to win their point anyway. At these times, the willingness to bend the rules and agree to a client\\'s assertive request can sometimes radically change the nature of the therapeutic relationship. The use of two leaders in conducting group treatment offers further avenues for setting up a dialectic, as noted earlier. In essence, each group leader\\'s style can function as one element in the dialectical opposition. For example, a \"good cop, bad cop\" strategy, in which one leader focuses on content while the other focuses on process can be used. Or one leader can help the other leader and a group member synthesize a tension or conflict. While one leader presents one side of the whole, the other leader presents the contrasting side. Specific Dialectical Strategies Although therapists will use all of the dialectical strategies at one time or another, some are particularly useful in skills training. The first task in teaching core mindfulness skills (see Chapter 7 of this manual) is to familiarize clients with the concept of \"wise mind.\" The strategy of activating \"wise mind\" should then be employed throughout skills training. When a client makes a statement representing an emotional or feeling state (e.g., \"I feel fat or unlovable\") as if the feeling state provides information about the empirical reality (\"1 am fat or unlovable\"), it is effective at times simply to question the client: \"I\\'m not interested in how you feel. I\\'m not interested in what you believe or think. I am interested in what you know to be true (in your \\'wise mind\\'). What do you know to be true? What is true?\" The dialectical tension here is between what the client feels to be true (\"emotion mind\") and what she thinks to be true (\"reasonable mind\"); the synthesis is what she knows to be true. The push toward \"wise mind\" can be easily abused, of course, especially when the therapist confuses \"wise mind\" with what the therapist believes to be the case. This can be particularly difficult when the therapist trusts the wisdom of his or her own knowledge or opinions. The value of therapeutic humility cannot be overstated. In DBT, one of the major functions of the supervision/consultation group is to provide a balance to the arrogance that can easily accompany the therapist\\'s powerful position. Almost any disaster or crisis is an opportunity to practice skills; this is an example of making lemonade out of lemons (i.e., finding the positives in a negative situation). As I have noted in Chapter 2 of this manual, conducting an open (rather than closed) group offers an opportunity to allow natural change, another dialectical strategy. Finally, therapists should be prepared to use story, myth, and parable to get across what they mean when teaching complex skills. In the case of mindfulness skills, there is often no other way to communicate the essence of the message. Problem-Solving Strategies Problem-solving strategies (discussed in detail in Chapter 9 of the text) are the backbone of the practice sharing component of skills training. In our model for group skills training, this comprises the first 50-60 minutes of every session. Problem-solving strategies are crucial in describing patterns over time, analyzing particular problematic situations and developing more effective coping strategies. The goal here is to get clients to begin using the problem solving strategies with one another and, of course, eventually with themselves. Behavioral Analysis In a group setting, the first step in practice sharing is for each group member to share with the group the particular skills she used (and their success or failure), as well as the situations she used them in during the previous week. (In an individual context, the client describes her skill usage during the week to her skills trainer.) Clients will inevitably present their situations and/or skill use in very general and vague terms at first. The first task of a skills trainer is to get a client to describe, step by step, the particular environmental and behavioral events leading up to the problem situation and to the successful or nonsuccessful attempt to use the skills. The skills trainer must lead the client through an exhaustive chain analysis of the problem. (How to do this, where to start and stop, and roadblocks to avoid are described in detail in Chapter 9 of the text.) Obviously, providing such a description requires that a client be able to observe during the week. Often clients have great difficulty describing what happened because they are not astute observers; however, with repeated practice and repeated reinforcement over the weeks, their observation and description skills tend to improve. A minute description allows a trainer to assess whether a client in fact used the skills appropriately. If the client was successful, this description in a group setting models for other clients how they can use those same skills for similar problems. Thus, the leader should try briefly to elicit from other group members examples of either similar problems or similar skill usage to foster this generalization. Often, however, a client has not used skills successfully: Either she couldn\\'t apply the skills, or they didn\\'t work when she did apply them. It is extremely important at this point to lead the client through a very detailed examination of just what did occur. This can be tortur-Other Strategies and Procedures 43 ous because almost always (especially during the first several months of therapy) clients are fearful of skills trainers\\' (and, in a group setting, other members\\') judgments and are also judging themselves in very negative ways. Thus, they can be expected to be very inhibited. Sometimes a client will jump right in with a notion of why a skill didn\\'t work or why she couldn\\'t apply it, without examining the actual events. These explanations are frequently pejorative and involve name calling (e.g., \"I am just stupid\"). Or a client may accept without question the premise that her situation is hopeless and skills will never help. Borderline individuals seem particularly unable to analyze objectively and calmly just what leads up to a particular problem, especially when the problem is their own behavior. Obviously, if they cannot conduct such an analysis, attempts to solve the problem are probably doomed from the start. Many are unable to see the critical role of environmental context in behavior and persist in viewing all behavior as a function of internal motives, needs, and the like. (It is, of course, essential that skills trainers not collude with this view.) Thus, the skills trainer\\'s task here is to engage the client in a behavioral analysis; to model nonpejorative, nonjudgmental behavioral evaluations; and (in a group context) to get both the individual and the group engaged in the process so that the same skills can be used in other problem situations. Almost all incidents of noncompliance with homework assignments (i.e., refusing or forgetting to practice skills) and of refusal or failure to engage in skills training activities should elicit an immediate movement into behavioral analysis with the client involved. The tendency of the client to offer simple solutions and answers must be counteracted. When a client reports that she did not do any homework practice, the first step is to get a precise definition of the behaviors missing. In eliciting this information, I focus on four variables: (1) whether the client thought about practicing; (2) whether the client felt motivated to practice; (3) whether the client attempted to practice some skill or problem-solving response; and (4) whether the response worked (i.e., made things better). For example, a client may have never thought about practicing the skills after leaving the session; may have thought about practicing but didn\\'t want to practice, may have thought about it, and wanted to practice, but couldn\\'t figure out how to do it; or forgot to do it; and so on. Such a behavioral description begins to highlight the variables that may be important influencing factors in noncompliance. If a client reports not ever thinking about home practice, then the task is to analyze what factors are related to her not remembering (the problem to be solved). Usually, the first several times this reason for noncompliance is reported, I describe the processes of short-term and long-term memory. I then help the client analyze whether the problem was that the idea of doing practice simply never made it out of short-term into longterm memory or that once it was in long-term memory nothing ever evoked the memory to operate. Often, I find that practicing does not get into long-term memory because the client doesn\\'t attend during the session when practice is discussed. If the problem is not one of memory but one of lack of motivation, then this is analyzed. The most important thing to remember here is to offer nonpejorative hypotheses and communicate to the client a nonjudgmental attitude; the client is usually judgmental enough. Hypotheses that are particularly worthy of exploration include hopelessness that the skills will do any good; hopelessness that the client can ever learn the skills; beliefs that she doesn\\'t need the skills and already has them; and beliefs that she should have learned these skills earlier, and therefore, is inadequate or stupid for having to learn them now. Such beliefs probably lead to negative emotional reactions, which the client then flees from. It is very important here to communicate to clients that it is OK to have hopeless beliefs, and that the skills trainers will not feel invalidated if the clients do not have perfect trust in them. Although each of these beliefs may be perfectly reasonable (and should be validated), holding on to the beliefs is probably not useful, and thus cheerleading (see Chapter 8 in the text), cognitive modification (see Chapter 11 in the text), and solution analysis (see below) are in order. Sometimes a dient reports that she tried to use the skills she was supposed to practice but could not carry them out. For example, a client may enter an interpersonal situation with every intent of applying some of the interpersonal effectiveness skills learned previously, but she may get confused and forget what to say or how to respond to a particular remark by the other person. At other times, a client may report using the skill appropriately, except that it didn\\'t work. Even the most skilled negotiator cannot always get what she wants; relaxation exercises, even when used correctly, do not always lead to reduction of anxiety and tension. In these instances, it is essential to get precise information about what happened. A client and a therapist may both be tempted is to skip this and decide that this particular skill is not useful for this particular client. Although this may be true, it may also be true that the client is not applying the skill in the correct way. Insight (Interpretation) Strategies The insight strategies will be used primarily during homework sharing and during the observation winddowns. During homework sharing, it is very important to look carefully for patterns in situational problems, 44 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER as well as typical responses to such problems. Highlighting idiosyncratic patterns can be especially helpful in future behavioral analyses. As mentioned previously, it is very important for clients to use a variety of strategies in coping with problem situations and emotions. Skills trainers should comment on any rigid patterns that they see, as well as on effective patterns or skills that the clients use. Clients\\' observations and comments about their own or one another\\'s skillful patterns should, of course, be observed and reinforced. It is essential to follow the guidelines provided in the insight section in Chapter 9 of the text. In a group context, comments about group members\\' behavior not only communicate to the individuals in question, but give information to all members about how they should evaluate and interpret their own behavior. The observing wind-down at the end of each session is another opportunity to utilize insight strategies in a group setting. Here it is particularly useful for the group leaders to comment on patterns of group interactions and group changes that they have noticed. Such insights highlight and foster the growth of dialectical thinking. Solution Analysis To a large extent, skills training is a general case of solution analysis. Skills are presented as practical solutions to life\\'s problems, and the potential effectiveness of various skills in particular situations is discussed during each meeting. Perhaps more than any other set of strategies, solution analysis utilizes the power of a group context. Each member should be encouraged to offer solution ideas to other group members and to help develop strategies to solve the problems described. For example, a member who is having trouble paying attention during group sessions and getting homework assignments into. short-term memory can be helped to think of ways to attend more closely. The group as a whole can almost always be counted on to come up with many solutions to not remembering to practice during the week. Difficulties in selecting the right skill to use or in applying a skill in a particular situation are further opportunities for group solution analysis. Almost always, someone will already have solved the problem at hand for herself; thus, the group leaders should be especially careful in the solution analysis phase not to jump in with solutions before eliciting possible solutions from other group members. However, they should not be reluctant to offer a solution or a particular application of a skill, even if other group members have offered other ideas. Didactic Strategies The second half of each skills training session is primarily didactic; during this section the therapists are teaching new material, generally through lectures and discussions. It is this direct teaching that constitutes didactic strategies. As the skills are taught, it is critical to attempt to link each skill to its intended outcome. For example, in teaching relaxation, skills trainers should describe not only how relaxation works but when it works, why it works, and what it works for. It is also useful to discuss when it doesn\\'t work, why it may not work, and how to make it work when it seems not to be working. The more trouble trainers can predict in advance, the better clients are likely to learn the skill. It is particularly important to remember that immediate emotional relief is not the goal of every skill taught in DBT skills training. This distinction is often not grasped by clients. In fact, almost always when they say that something didn\\'t work, they mean that it didn\\'t make them feel better immediately. Thus, the relationship of skills to long-term goals versus short-term goals, and to long-term relief versus immediate relief has to be discussed over and over. It is particularly important not to be pulled into always trying to show how a skilled behavior will make a person feel better right away. First, it isn\\'t usually true; second, even if it were true it is not necessarily beneficiaL Orienting Strategies The necessity for orientation in psychotherapy comes mostly from the relationship of psychotherapy to other forms of structured learning tasks. Knowing exactly what the task is, what one\\'s role is, and what one can expect from the other person facilitates learning enormously. I have discussed the principles of orienting clients to skills training in general, and to each specific module, in the preceding chapter. The thing to remember here, however, is that orientation is called for with each specific skill and with each homework assignment. Commitment Strategies As I say repeatedly throughout both this book and the text, getting the client to commit herself to therapy, to learning, and to changing her behavior is all-important in DBT. I have discussed in the preceding chapter the necessity of getting an overall commitment to therapy. In skills training, the client also needs to make a recommitment to each treatment module, as well as a commitment every week to practice new skills between sessions. Other Strategies and Procedures 45 Validation Strategies The validation strategies (discussed in detail in Chapter 8 of the text) are absolutely essential to DBT. It was the necessity of combining validation with problem-solving strategies and other change procedures that first led me to develop a \"new\" version of cognitive-behavioral therapy. As in individual psychotherapy, validation strategies are used in every skills training session in DBT. They involve a nonjqdgmental therapeutic attitude and a continual search for the essential validity of each clients\\' responses (and, in a group context, those of the group as a whole). In group settings, both the leaders and the group as a whole function as the opposing pole to the invalidating environments commonly experienced by borderline individuals. The first general task in validating is to help clients observe and accurately describe their own emotions, thoughts, and overt behavior patterns. Much of DBT psychosocial skills training -in particular, mindfulness training -is aimed at just this. Second, skills trainers communicate empathy with clients\\' emotional tone, indicate understanding of (though not necessarily agreement with) their beliefs and expectancies, andlor make clear observations of their behavioral action patterns. In other words, the trainers observe and describe the clients\\' behavior accurately. Third, and most importantly, the trainers communicate that the clients\\' emotional responses, beliefs and expectancies, and overt behaviors are understandable and make sense in the context of their lives and the current moment. In each instance, the trainers look for the nugget of gold in the cup of sandthe validity within what may otherwise be a very dysfunctional response. This is the reverse of the invalidating environment\\'s approach. In both group and individual skills training, almost constant cheerleading is necessary. The skills trainers\\' biggest problem here will probably be maintaining the energy necessary to cajole, prod, sweet-talk, and cheer on the clients\\' very slow movement in adopting new, more skillful behaviors. The tensions between \"I can\\'tlI won\\'t\" and \"You canlYou must\" can drain even the most energetic therapist. In a group context, each group leader must rely on the other to provide fresh energy when he or she is losing steam and to bail him or her out of a willful dialogue with members. It is equally important in group skills training to elicit and reinforce clients\\' validation of one another. The ability to validate others is one of the skills taught in the interpersonal effectiveness module. Borderline individuals, although noteworthy in their ability to empathize with and validate one another, are also capable of highly judgmental responses. (In some groups, this can become a special problem in the observing winddown at the end of session.) Emotional patterns they have not experienced, thought patterns they are not familiar with, and behaviors they have not exhibited are difficult for them to understand and validate. My experience, however, is that group members bend over backwards to validate one another and that a greater problem is for the leaders to draw out their negative observations and descriptions of one another. These negative reactions need also to be validated in the group setting. Peace at all costs, a typical objective in some borderline families, is not the norm in group skills training. Other clients, of \\'course, grew up with the norm of no peace at any cost; once again, a dialectic emerges. In group skills training sessions, validation means that the leaders should always point out the truth inherent in clients\\' comments and group experiences, even while simultaneously demonstrating the contradictory point of view. Conflict within the group or between an individual group member and a leader is dealt with by validating both sides of the conflict and arriving at a resolution that integrates both points of view, rather than invalidating one side or the other. Change Procedures Contingency Procedures As noted in Chapter 3 of this manual, the major therapeutic contingencies are discussed in the first session when the rules of DBT skills training are introduced. However, only two of the rules involve clear contingencies: Missing 4 consecutive weeks of scheduled skills training sessions in a row, or not meeting with one\\'s individual therapist for 4 consecutive weeks of scheduled sessions, will result in termination of therapy. There are no clear contingencies for violation of the other rules. In my experience, it is never a good idea to tell clients that they will be terminated from skills training if they break rules. So what are the contingencies for rule breaking? The main ones are therapist andlor member disapproval, attention to the rule breaking, more interpersonal distance and commitment from others, and loss of therapeutic effectiveness. Contingency Management As discussed in Chapter 10 of the text, the basic idea in contingency management is that the client\\'s adaptive functional behavior should result in reinforcement and negative maladaptive behavior should result in either aversive outcomes or no discernible outcomes that could reinforce the behavior. The most important factors to 46 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER keep in mind in applying contingencies are (1) that the outcomes for adaptive behaviors (i.e., all behaviors target for increase) must indeed be reinforcing for the particular client and (2) that principles of shaping must be taken into account. In skills training, therapists are faced with managing both in-session behaviors and behaviors that occur outside of sessions. Applying reinforcing contingencies. The most important point to keep in mind here is that positive reinforcement must be impartially scrutinized. That is, skills trainers should not assume that a particular response on their part is a positive reinforcer without checking this out. One of the biggest mistakes therapists often make is to assume that public praise will reinforce client behaviors. In fact, public praise may serve to punish the very behaviors therapists are trying to increase. If an individual\\'s history involves many instances in which praise and acknowledgment of skill and strength have led to an absence of further help, praise may come to alert the person to upcoming punishment or extinction. In my experience, this particular issue comes up over and over in skills training. It is not a good idea, however, to stop praising behaviors to be reinforced, because a client can interpret the absence of praise as her never being able to do anything right-in other words, as implied criticism. So what is the synthesis? The best strategy is to praise behavior appropriately (e.g., to comment that the behavior is skilled if it is, constitutes progress if it does, etc.) and to follow this immediately with a recognition that this does not mean that the client can solve all of her problems or has no more problems to be solved. In this way, the praise is freed from the expectancy that competence will result in loss of any further help. Use (and misuse) of praise as a reinforcer is discussed in more detail in Chapter 10 of the text. As far as possible, skills trainers should try to provide natural reinforcers for clients\\' adaptive behavior. \"Natural reinforcers\" are responses that clients can expect in everyday life. Thus, if clients are taught assertion skills, and then trainers never reward assertive behaviors by giving them what they request, it is unreasonable to expect those behaviors to continue. Similarly, if clients\\' attempts at regulating intense emotions precipitated by having to talk in skills training sessions meet with the trainers\\' making them continue talking even longer, it is unreasonable to expect the clients to continue regulating their emotional responses. If clients improve their tolerance of aversive events during sessions, and this is followed by the trainers\\' reducing their efforts to make sessions less aversive, it is unreasonable to expect further distress tolerance. The point is that as clients begin to apply the skills being taught, skills trainers must be careful to respond in a manner that will reinforce such improvement. Although shaping principles require the trainers eventually to \"up the ante;\\' so to speak, and require even more skillful behavior, increases in demands must be kept gradual. Otherwise, clients will always feel that they cannot do enough to please the trainers or to get their needs met. It can also be useful to pair natural reinforcement with praise. Extinction and Punishment Techniques. Even though reinforcement is the preferred form of contingency management, aversive (punishment) and extinction procedures are at times required. Generally, aversive procedures should be used when a client is trying to avoid difficult activities such as coming to skills training sessions, doing homework or in-session practice, or engaging in active problem solving. In these cases, it is essential to intervene immediately and push the client, instead of ignoring her and allowing the avoidance to continue. In other words, the avoidance response must be;short-circuited. The idea is to make the immediate co~sequences of avoiding more aversive than those of not avoiding. When a client misses a session, for example, the policy is to call her immediately and try to cheerlead her into coming to the session. The therapist uses the broken record strategy taught clients in the interpersonal skills module. (I usually have a bus schedule handy when I call.) The exception to this policy, discussed further on, is when calling reinforces missing sessions. Another common avoidance pattern in a group context is for a member who did not do any homework practice to try not to discuss it in the session. If the group leaders jump over the member and go on to the next one, then the avoidance has worked. The best strategy is to move immediately, in a nonjudgmental and warm fashion, to an attempt to analyze not doing the homework. If the member still refuses after some pushing, the leader should move toward analyzing why she doesn\\'t want to talk. The point is that avoidance should not be rewarded. When carried out fully, analysis of the resistance is an aversive technique for most clients. Positive maladaptive behaviors (e.g., attempts to get attention, sobbing, hostile behavior, attempts to discuss weekly life crises) should be put on an extinction schedule. A skills trainer ignores the client\\'s maladaptive behaviors and continues to interact with the client as if she is not producing such behaviors. Or, if the behaviors cannot be ignored, the trainer can make a brief comment suggesting that the client cope with her maladaptive behavior by using some of the skills she is learning in the current (or a past) skills module. Thus, a client who begins crying can be encouraged to practice her aistress tolerance or mindfulness skills. If a client is storming out of the room, a trainer can suggest calmly that she attempt to use her emotion regulation skills and, once she is calm, come back into the session. Unless skills Other Strategies and Procedures 47 trainers have dear reasons to believe that a client is leaving a session to kill herself, clients should usually not be followed when they leave skills training sessions precipitously. (Even if it would not reinforce the person\\'s leaving, it might serve as vicarious reinforcement for others\\' leaving.) However, leaving (and thus avoiding skills training) should not be reinforced unchecked. Thus, a trainer should alert the individual psychotherapist, so that the behavior can be dealt with in individual therapy as an instance of therapy-interfering behavior, or the precipitous leaving can be discussed in the next session. It is very important to remember to soothe both clients whose behavior is on an extinction schedule and those who are receiving aversive consequences. (In my experience, the ability to put a client\\'s behavior on an extinction schedule and simultaneously soothe the client is one of the hardest tasks to learn for new therapists.) In each case, the behavior is what is being punished, not the person. Especially in group skills training, leaders need to develop the ability to ignore many behaviors and to come back to the members with a soothing comment after the behaviors stop. Or, even while the dysfunctional behaviors are going on, leaders can soothe members while at the same time insisting that they practice their skills anyway. To a member crying about a relationship breakup, you might say something to this effect: \"I know this is really difficult for you, but try your best to distract yourself from your troubles. Be mindful to the task and tell me about your efforts to practice your skills this week.\" After listening to a few other group members, the leader might go back to this member and ask briefly but warmly, \"How are you doing with your attempt to be mindful to group? ... Keep trying.\" Shaping. Shaping is the backbone of skills training. Without shaping, both therapists and clients would become so frustrated and distressed that skills training could not proceed. Inevitably, borderline individuals have no self-shaping skills. Their unreasonable expectations for immediate perfection interfere constantly with their ability to learn the skills gradually. Thus, it is crucial that skills trainers continually model shaping principles. Not only should they be discussed openly and explained, but trainers\\' expectations of clients should also follow shaping principles. With the client in individual skills training, or the individual group member, the principles are no different than in individual therapy. What group leaders sometimes forget, however, is that these same principles apply to the entire group. In my experience, one of the greatest difficulties in conducting DBT group skills training is that therapists\\' expectations for the group as a whole are far higher than the group can deliver. At our clinic it is not until the third year of therapy that borderline clients can interact in group sessions like reasonably ordinary group therapy clients. Observing Limits As I have discussed in Chapter 10 of the text, DBT does not generally believe in setting limits, but instead favors observing naturally occurring limits. In skills training, however, a number of limits are set by the therapy itself. These limits are arbitrary, in that I could conceivably have developed different rules. Other limits that must be observed are those of the skills trainers as individuals and (in a group context) of the group as a whole. Limits of Skills Training. The key limitation of DBT skills training is that the skills trainers do not function as individual therapists during skills training sessions. The role of skills trainers is clearly defined and limited to teaching psychosocial skills and dealing with the interpersonal relationships that arise in sessions. A skills trainer is like a university professor or a high school teacher. \"Personal\" calls to skills training leaders are acceptable only under certain conditions. Clients may call if they will not be able to attend group for some reason, or if they have a serious interpersonal problem with a trainer that cannot be resolved in a session. An exception to these phone limits occurs when a skills training client is also receiving DBT individual psychotherapy from another therapist in the same clinical setting. In these instances, a skills training leader serves as a backup therapist for the individual therapist. Thus, when the individual psychotherapist is out of town, it is appropriate for the client to call the skills training therapist under the same circumstances that she would call her individual therapist. When the reason for the call is to discuss interpersonal relationships in the skills training, there are some limits. These limits are the natural limits of the skills training leader, and thus the ordinary strategies of observing limits in individual therapy apply. It is essential that a skills training leader in this situation understand these phone limits and communicate them clearly to the clients. In my experience, the best way to communicate phone limits is by discussing the important role of the individual psychotherapist in the total DBT program, and pointing out that skills trainers do not duplicate the individual psychotherapist\\'s job. In our experience, clients grasp this rule very quickly and rarely violate it. Most phone calls other than session cancellations revolve around their relationships with skills trainers or (in a group context) with other group members. At times a client may call to find out whether a trainer hates her and wants her out of skills training. At other times a client may call to discuss how it is completely imposSKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER sible to continue in skills training any longer, since sessions are so painful. Relationship problem-solving strategies must be implemented by the skills training leaders during such phone calls. These are discussed in detail both in Chapter 15 of the text and at the end of this chapter. A second limit during the first year of DBT skills training is that personal crises are generally not discussed in skills training sessions. This limit is made crystal clear for the first several sessions and is reclarified thereafter when clients wish to discuss their current crises. If a crisis is extreme, of course, skills training leaders may choose to violate the rule. To cite a very extreme example, when a group member in our clinic was raped on her way to a group session, we of course discussed it. A death in the family, a divorce, a breakup of a relationship, or a rejection by a therapist may be reported and briefly discussed at the beginning of sessions. The key to getting borderline individuals to follow this rule is in how a crisis is dealt with. Generally, any topic can be discussed if the focus is on how the client can use the skills being learned to cope with the crisis. Thus, although at first glance it would appear that the \"crisis of the week\" cannot be discussed, at second glance it is obvious that it can be, as long as it is discussed within the context of DBT skills. This orientation, however, is not always the orientation that a person is hoping for. Rather than giving clients free rein to discuss their problems and to share all the details, skills training leaders very quickly intervene to highlight the relationship of these problems to the particular skill module of the moment. For example, if an individual psychotherapist has terminated a client, this can be dealt with in terms of the interpersonal effectiveness skills the client can use to find out why, to find a new therapist, or to get her therapist back. It can also be approached from the standpoint of how hurt the client is feeling in response to the rejection and how the client can feel better. Ifcore mindfulness skills are the focus, the client can be encouraged to observe and describe the event and her responses. She can also be helped to notice whether she is judging and how she can focus on what works rather than on revenge. Finally, the problem can be approached in tenns of how the person is going to survive it or tolerate it without engaging in impulsive destructive behaviors. Most ptoblems lend themselves to an analysis in terms of each of the skill modules. Noninterpersonal situations which at first glance may seem inappropriate for the interpersonal effectiveness module, can be looked at as opportunities for finding friends to share with and for obtaining the social support the client needs to cope with the problem. Skills trainers must be vigilant in always bringing the crisis back to the skills. When the skills seem ineffective or insufficient for the problem, the client should be encouraged to talk with her individual therapist. Finally, the limits of structured skills training may have to be observed in regard to process issues. Some clients in a group context are more than happy to have group sessions run in a psychoeducational fonnat rather than an interpersonal process format. However, in every group I have ever run, a number of people are very dissatisfied with this approach and are far more comfortable discussing interpersonal problems and group issues. Such patients will inevitably suggest that skills training is not \"real therapy\" if these problems are not addressed. The group leaders need to carefully communicate the limits of skills training versus psychotherapy on this point. (The tendency to favor process discussions and work on individual crises is, as I have noted previously, much more pronounced when skills training is conducted individually and is a principal reason for conducting skills training in groups.) Personal Limits of Skills Training Leaders. The observing-limits approach with respect to the skills training leaders is no different in DBT skills training than it is in other components of DBT. Essentially, it is the task of the leaders to observe their own limits in conducting the treatment. In my experience, the crucial limit that must be observed has to do with phone calls. Therapists must track their own ability to handle lengthy interpersonal discussions with clients and must communicate their limits clearly to the clients. Limits of a Group as a Whole. The key limit of first-year DBT skills training groups is that they cannot tolerate hostile attacks in sessions. My colleagues and I have had to make it very clear with group members that such behaviors as throwing things, destroying property, and attacking or harshly criticizing other group members are proscribed. When hostile behavior occurs, group members are encouraged to work on the problem with their individual psychotherapists. However, it is preferable for an individual to leave a group session (even if only temporarily) than to engage in these behaviors. The group leaders, of course have to be careful in this situation not to punish the member for leaving on the one hand and to punish her for staying on the other. Dialectical balance is crucial, since the leaders also want to encourage the member to stay at a session and inhibit maladaptive behaviors as long as possible. Exposure-Based Procedures Structured exposure-based procedures are not used in DBT skills training, although there is no reason why anOther Strategies and Procedures 49 cilIary treattnents oriented to exposure (e.g., sexual abuse groups) could not be combined effectively with DBT. Less structured exposure-based procedures, however, are consistently used in skills training in two ways. First, clients\\' avoidance of topics, procedures, and process discussions (when process is the focus) is almost always blocked. Second, clients are instructed over and over about the value of exposure. In well-run DBT skills training, after several months of therapy every client should be able to give a very good rationale for why and when avoidance makes things worse and why and when exposure improves them. Thus, when clients employ exposure to difficult tasks or feared situations during homework practice, the therapists should note and reinforce it. Cognitive Modification Procedures Cognitive Restructuring There are a number of structured exercises throughout the skills training program for helping clients examine and modify dysfunctional assumptions and beliefs. However, formal cognitive restructuring plays a much smaller role in DBT than in other forms of cognitive-behavioral treattnents, and cognitive treattnent of BPD in particular. This topic is discussed extensively in Chapters 8 and 11 of the text. Contingency Clarification The task in contingency clarification is to help patients clarify the \"if-then\" contingency relationships in their lives and in the therapy situation. Contingency clarification can be distinguished from the didactic strategies. The didactic strategies stress general contingent rules that hold for all or most people, contingency clarification always looks for the contingent relationships operating in an individual client\\'s life. One of the reasons for the moment-to-moment, point-to-point exploration during behavioral analysis is to help clients learn to better observe the contingent relationships occurring in their everyday lives. Borderline individuals often have great difficulty observing these natural contingencies. When it comes to observing the effects of using new behavioral skills, they may be motivated to miss the benefits. The dialectic here is between being competent and getting help -a point discussed in the preceding chapter. One of the skills trainers\\' tasks here is to demonstrate to clients that the contingencies formerly favoring dysfunctional behaviors are not currently operating. Thus, whereas it may have previously been true that when a client acted in a capable manner she lost her access to help, the rule is no longer operating in skills training. I discuss the clarification of therapeutic contingencies further at the end of this chapter. In the interpersonal effectiveness module, it is important to stress the importance of observing contingencies in interpersonal encounters. Thus, homework practice always includes trying a new skill and observing its outcome. The idea is not to prove preconceived beliefs of the therapists or the clients about contingent relationships, but rather to explore the actual contingent relationships naturally existing in the client\\'s everyday lives. It will often become clear in the process that contingencies or rules for one person may not apply to another. Furthermore, rules that operate in one context may not operate in another for the very same person. Figuring out the rules of the game, so to speak, is intimately related to the behavioral skill of being effective or focusing on what works-one ofthe core mindfulness skills. Focusing on what works is focusing on engaging in behaviors where contingent outcomes are the desired outcomes. This approach is often a new one for borderline individuals, since they are more experienced at looking at behaviors in terms of \"right\" or \"wrong\" from a moral point of view than in terms of outcomes or consequences. Contingency clarification strategies are a step in moving these individuals toward more effective behavior. In discussing behavioral outcomes, skills trainers should remember that a poor outcome is not necessarily proof that a particular skill does not work, and should examine carefully whether the person actually performed the skilled behavior correctly. At times, a person will say that a particular response does not help when the problem is that the individual could not produce the skilled response. This is a very tricky distinction and requires patience and care during behavioral analysis. Stylistic Strategies Reciprocal Communication Strategies Reciprocal communication in the context of skills training requires that trainers make themselves vulnerable to their clients and express this vulnerability in a manner that can be heard and understood by the clients. As always, there is a question of balance here, and the fulcrum on which this balance is based is the therapeutic welfare of the clients. Thus, reciprocity is in the service of the clients, not for the benefit of the skills training leaders. Leaders\\' expression of vulnerability in sessions not only addresses the power imbalance that all clients experience, but also can serve as an important modeling event: It can teach clients how to draw the line between privacy and sharing, how to experience vulnerable 50 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER states without shame, and how to cope with their own limitations. In addition, it provides a glimpse into the world of so-called \"normal\" people, thus normalizing vulnerability and life with limitations. One of the easiest ways to use reciprocal communication in skills training is for the skills trainers to share their own experiences in doing homework practice. In my experience, one of the benefits of leading skill groups is that it gives me an opportunity to also work on improving my own skills. If group leaders can share their own attempts (and especially their failures) with humor, so much the better. Sometimes, the trick is for the leaders to label their own experiences as relevant to the skills the group is attempting to learn. For example, when I am teaching how to say no to unwanted requests, I almost always discuss my own difficulties in saying no to group members\\' pressures to get me to do things I don\\'t think are therapeutic. Since resisting their intense attempts at persuasion usually requires me to use al! of my own skills, the example covers quite a bit of the material we teach in skills training. By now, all of my skills groups know about my efforts to deal with my unreasonable fear of heights when I go hiking (focusing on one thing in the moment, distraction, self-encouragement), with back pain on meditation retreats (focusing on one thing, radical acceptance), and with other assorted life dilemmas I encounter from week to week. Coleaders of mine have discussed their troubles in learning to meditate, difficulties with asking for things, problems in coping with bosses and professors, the process of mourning losses, and so on. The point is that sharing one\\'s own flawed attempts to use the skills being taught can provide valuable modeling both in how to apply skills and in how to respond to one\\'s own vulnerability in a nonjudgmental fashion. Reciprocal communication can be especially difficult to practice in a group setting as opposed to a oneto-one setting. It can feel like many against one or two. This difficulty, of course, should give group leaders more empathy for the group members, who usually experience the very same problem. Nonetheless, sharing the difficulty does not make it go away. It can also be very difficult to respond in a manner appropriate to each member, when members are in many different places (psychologically speaking) at once. The time it takes to find out where even one member is may preclude efforts to explore the current psychological state of other members. And, to the extent that group leaders attend to such within-session process issues, they are veering away from the goals of skills training anyway. By contrast, as an individual therapist you can titrate responses to fit the individual client; timing and attention to various topics can be geared to the state of the one person at hand. In group sessions, it is very difficult to strike a response that meets each member\\'s needs. Thus, it is often much more difficult to move the group forward (or anywhere but down, it often seems). This frustration may act to make group leaders want to pull away and close up, or, at other times, to pull close enough to attack. Either way, the frustration reduces the experience of warmth and engagement. In such a stressful atmosphere, it is sometimes difficult to relax. And it is difficult for leaders to be responsive when they are not relaxed. Great care must be taken to observe the effects of self-disclosure on group members. To a certain extent, their ability to accept such a stance is variable. In a group setting, however, individual differences may be harder to detect than in the individual setting, where the focus is always on the individual client. Difficulties are easy to camouflage and easy to overlook. It can be reasonably safely said, however, that all members will have difficulties with the leaders\\' expressing their frustration and/or anger with the group; thus, extraordinary care must be taken in doing so. Irreverent Communication Strategies Irreverence has to be used very carefully in group skills training, although it can be used quite liberally when skills training is conducted individually. This is because irreverence requires a therapist to observe very closely the immediate effects of his or her response and move to repair any damage as quickly as possible. It is very difficult to be that astute and attentive to each individual in a group setting. The person a group leader is talking to may be very receptive to an irreverent statement, but another group member, listening in, may be horrified. Once leaders get to know their clients fairly well, they can be more comfortable using irreverence. Specific examples and the rationale for the irreverent communication are discussed in Chapter 12 of the text. The main place for irreverence, in a group context, is usually in the individual work with each client during the first hour of a session (the practice-sharing component). In irreverence, problematic behavior is reacted to as if it were normal, and functional adaptive behavior is reacted to with enthusiasm, vigor, and positive emotionality. Or dysfunctional plans or actions may be overreacted to in a humorous fashion. Or behaviors or communications may be responded to in a blunt, confrontational style. The aim of irreverence is to jolt the individual client, or the group as a whole, into seeing things from a new, more enlightened perspective. Irreverent communication should help clients to make the transition from seeing their own dysfunctional behavior as a cause of shame and scorn to seeing it as inconsequential and even funny and humorous. To do this, a therOther Strategies and Procedures SI apist can only be a half step ahead of them; timing is of the essence. An irreverent attitude is not an insensitive attitude, nor is it an excuse for hostile or demeaning behavior. A group leader always takes suffering seriously, albeit matter-of-factly, calmly, and sometimes with humor. Case Management Strategies Environmental Intervention Strategies Environmental intervention strategies are almost never used by the therapists in skills training. Members of a skills training group, however, are encouraged to use these strategies with one another. For example, clients are encouraged to call one another when in trouble, ask favors of one another, get rides to group meetings or to hospitals when needed, and so forth. Clients will often want much more environmental intervention from skills trainers than the trainers should be willing to give. An example (which occurs frequently) has to do with getting a pass from an inpatient unit to come to a session. It can often be difficult for a client to talk a hospital into giving such a pass. The client may then want a skills trainer to call the hospital on her behalf. The trainer\\'s first response should be to emphasize to the client that it is her responsibility to behave in such a way that inpatient treatment personnel will want to let her leave the hospital on a pass for skills training. My one concession to the politics of inpatient hospitalization is that if it appears absolutely necessary, I will call the inpatient personnel to let them know that I do indeed expect that inpatients get themselves out on a pass to come to skills training sessions. I do not, however, try to convince them to let a particular client out. Over and over in skills training, sessions trainers must stress that their job is to teach clients environmental intervention skills so that they can do environmental interventions for themselves. New clients may be shocked at first with this confidence that they will eventually succeed in learning these skills. But the shock is balanced with an emerging pleasure at being treated as adults who can run their own lives. Consultation-to-the-Patientl Client Strategies In general, DBT requires a skills training therapist to play the role of a consultant to the client rather than that of a consultant to other people in the client\\'s social network, including other therapists the client may have. DBT assumes that the client is capable of performing intermediary functions between various therapists. Thus, the skills training therapist does not playa parental role, assuming that the client is unable to communicate in a straightforward manner with those in her own treatment network. When safety is an immediate issue, or it is very obvious that the client cannot serve as an intermediary for herself, the therapist should move from the \"consultation-to-the-patient\" (or, in this context, \"client\") strategies to the environmental intervention strategies. Rules for when to use which of the two group of strategies are clearly laid out in Chapter 13 of the text. The consultation strategies are quite different from how therapists may have learned to relate to other professionals treating their clients. The rationale for the strategies is spelled out in the text as well. The one exception to these rules occurs when an individual in skills training is in a complete DBT program, including DBT individual psychotherapy. In such a case, the client\\'s skills training and individual therapists consult weekly. The role of the skills trainers in these consultations is to give the individual psychotherapist information about how the client is doing in skills training; they alert him or her to problems that may need work in individual psychotherapy and share insights that are being given in the skills training sessions. These consultations are limited to sharing of information and joint treatment planning. It must, of course, be clear to the client from the very beginning that she is being treated by a team of therapists who will coordinate therapy at every opportunity. The interaction of the two therapy modalities is stressed by both the individual and the skills training therapists. A DBT skills training therapist, however, does not serve as an intermediary for the individual client with her individual psychotherapist. If she is having problems with her individual therapist, the skills training leaders should usually consult with her on how she might address these problems in the individual therapy. Generally, the task of the skills training therapists here is to help the client use the skills she is learning to work on the problem. If a client is in individual therapy that is independent of the DBT skills training program (Le., with another therapist in a different treatment setting), the consultation-to-the-client approach will generally involve some contact with the individual therapist. These consultations ordinarily should not be conducted without the client present. The material taught in skills training can and usually should be shared with the individual psychotherapist. The skills trainers\\' task in this case is to help the client do this effectively. Difficulties that individual clients experience with other therapists and clinical agencies can be dealt with in the skills training sessions if those difficulties can be made relevant to the skills being taught. Thus, in the interpersonal effectiveness module, an individual client may be helped to communicate more effectively with 52 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER other professionals treating her. In the emotion regulation module, she can be helped to modulate her emotional reactions to these professionals. During the distress tolerance module, she can be assisted in accepting and tolerating the behaviors of other professionals that she finds problematic. Generally, problems with treatment professionals brought up in skills training sessions are dealt with in precisely the same manner that any other interpersonal problem is dealt with. Special Treatment Strategies There are six integrative strategies in DBT for responding to the following specific issues and problems in treatment: crises, suicidal behavior, therapy-interfering behavior, telephone calls, ancillary treatments, and therapeutic relationship issues. I have discussed the telephone strategies for skills trainers earlier in this chapter. And in a standard DBT program, teaching clients to utilize ancillary treatments (medication, inpatient hospitalization, etc.) effectively is the responsibility of their individual therapists and not the skills trainers (see Chapter 15 of the text for a discussion). In the remainder of this chapter, I review the crisis, suicidal behavior, and therapy-interfering behavior strategies as they apply to skills training. I have covered these three sets of strategies in such detail in the text, however, that I discuss them briefly here. The relationship strategies, on the other hand, require a good deal more work in a group skills training context; thus, I discuss them at some length. Crisis Strategies The responsibility for assisting a client in crisis belongs to the primary or individual psychotherapist. When a skills training client is in crisis, a skills trainer should (I) refer her to her psychotherapist, assisting her in making contact if necessary, and (2) help her apply distress tolerance skills until she makes contact. The crisis strategies described in Chapter 15 of the text should be used in a modified version. Just as borderline clients are often in a state of individual crisis, a group can be in a state of crisis also. A group in crisis is functioning in a state of emotional overload. Usually, this will be the result of a common trauma such as a group member\\'s committing suicide, a hostile act directed at the entire group, a therapist\\'s leaving, and so on. In these instances, group leaders should employ all of the crisis strategies used in individual crisis intervention; they are simply applied to the entire group instead of to one client. The steps are summarized in Table 5.1. TABLE 5.1.

T anticipates a recurrence of the crisis response. Note. In this table and Tables 5.2 and 5.3, T refers to the skills training therapist. Suicidal Behavior Strategies If the risk of suicide is imminent (Tables 15.3 and 15.4 in Chapter 15 of the text provide the information needed to assess this), a skills trainer should call the individual psychotherapist immediately for instructions on how to proceed. During periods of crises and high suicide risk, it may be useful to ask the individual therapist to be on call following group sessions. If the individual therapist cannot be located, the skills trainer must do crisis intervention until contact can be made with the individual therapist. Generally, a skills trainer should be much more conservative in the treatment of suicidal risk than is the individual therapist. It is essential, however, to get and keep a copy of the individual therapist\\'s crisis planning sheet (see Figure 15.1 in the text). Steps for intervention when a client is threatening imminent suicide or parasuicide, or is actually engaging in parasuicidal behavior during contact (or has just engaged in it), are listed in Table 5.2. They are discussed in detail in the text. Therapy-Destructive and Therapy-Interfering Behavior Strategies When a client is engaging in behaviors that are clearly destructive to skills training, the skills trainers must respond promptly and vigorously. A modified version of the therapy-interfering behavior protocol described in Chapter 15 of the text can be applied here; the strategies, modified for use in a skills training setting, are listed in Table 5.3. Other Strategies and Procedures 53 TABLE 5.2.

In this table and Table 5.3, C refers to the client. When a therapy-interfering behavior is failure to do homework practice assignments, it is responded to during homework practice review. I have already discussed this in previous sections of this chapter. With most other therapy interfering behaviors, skills trainers should use the therapy-destructive behavior strategies in Table 5.3 in a more gentle manner, or the relationship problemsolving strategies discussed below. Relationship Strategies Relationship Acceptance Relationship acceptance in group skills training requires that leaders experience and communicate acceptance of TABLE 5.3.

First, as in individual therapy, the clinical progress of each client must be accepted as it is. Relationships between leaders and group members, between members and other therapists, between and among individual members, between the group leaders themselves, and between the group as a whole and the group leaders must also be accepted. The sheer complexity of the situation can make acceptance difficult, because it is easy to get overwhelmed; rigidity and nonacceptance usually follow. It is essential to try not to pave over or quickly truncate conflict and difficult emotions in the group. Many borderline clients have great difficulty with group skills training. Some are in it only because it is required, and they feel uncomfortable and are unable to interact effectively in this atmosphere. For others, skills seem unimportant, juvenile, or silly. Still others quickly become demoralized by unsuccessful attempts to master the skills. Group skills training with borderline clients does not have the naturally occurring characteristics reinforcing leaders that most groups have. Skills training leaders are faced with dead silences; noncompliance; inappropriate and sometimes extreme responses to the slightest deviation from perfect sensitivity; and a group atmosphere that at times can be noncommunicative, hostile, nonsupportive, and nonappreciative. The potential for mistakes in leading such a group is vast. A leader can expect not only to make many, but to be acutely aware of many of the mistakes the other group leader makes. Reality acceptance skills are crucial if mistakes are to be responded to in a nondestructive manner. Attacking group members, or threatening them, is almost always a result of a failure of relationship acceptance. Acceptance requires a nonjudgmental attitude that sees all problems as part of the therapeutic process.....!\\'grist for the mill;\\' so to speak. Leaders simply have to see that most problematic responses on the part of the group are derivative responses based on borderline response patterns. In other words, if borderline clients S4 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER didn\\'t present with the problems that drive leaders crazy, they wouldn\\'t need a skills training group. To the extent that leaders fail to recognize this fact, they are likely to engage in rejecting, victim-bashing behaviors that may be too subtle to be seen for what they are, but nonetheless have an iatrogenic effect. In other words, an \"easy\" leader disposition has to either be innate or cultivated. Relationship E.nhancement Relationship enhancement strategies (discussed briefly in connection with contracting strategies in Chapter 14 of the text) have to do with a therapist\\'s behaviors that increase therapeutic values of the relationship. These are those behaviors that make the relationship more than simply a helpful friendship. A positive collaborative interpersonal relationship is no less important in skills training than it is in individual psychotherapy. However, the development of such a relationship is considerably more complex in group skills training because of the increased number of individuals involved in the relationship. The question for the group leaders is how to establish such a relationship both between group members and leaders and among the members themselves. All of the DBT strategies are designed in one way or another to enhance the collaborative working relationship. The strategies discussed here are those intended primarily to establish the group leaders as experts, as creditable, and as efficacious. Thus, the goal of these strategies is to communicate to the group members that the leaders indeed know what they are doing and have something to offer that will probably be helpful to the group members. This is no easy task. The task is made even more difficult by the fact that group members often share with one another their previous failures in both individual and other group therapies, and comment about the hopelessness of their situation and the meagerness of any help that can be offered. Group members often portray their problems as Goliath and the treatment as David, but without David ending as he does in the Old Testament. The task of the leaders is to convey the story as it indeed occurred. Expertise, credibility, and efficacy can be conveyed in a variety of ways. Therapists\\' neatness, professionalism, interest, comfort, self-confidence, speech style, and preparation for therapy sessions are no less useful in skills training than in individual psychotherapy. It is especially important in conducting groups to have the group room prepared before the group members arrive: Forms should be distributed, chairs should be in place, and the refreshments should be made. The key to the credibility problem, in my experience, is that clients simply do not believe that learning the skills presented will in fact be helpful. This disbelief detracts from any positive motivation to learn the skills, and unless clients learn the skills and obtain positive rewards it is difficult to change this attitude. Thus, it is a vicious circle. Leaders must come up with a way to break this vicious circle if the clients are to move. The most helpful approach is simply for the leaders to tell group members that in their experience these skills have been helpful to some people some of the time. This, of course, can only be said if that is indeed the leaders\\' experience; leaders who have never taught these skills must rely on others\\' experience. (Our outcome data can form a data base for inexperienced therapists.) In addition, leaders can share their own experience with skills. For some clients, the most powerful inducement to learn the skills is the knowledge that the leaders have found the skills helpful for themselves. Credibility is damaged when leaders promise that a particular skill will solve a particular problem. In fact, DBT is something of a shotgun approach: Some of the skills work some of the time for some of the people. I have not had any clients to date who could not benefit from something, but no one benefits from everything. It is crucial to present this information; otherwise the leaders\\' credibility is on the line immediately. Another key issue to address is that oftrust and confidentiality. Opportunities to display trustworthiness occur when one member is absent from a group session. At all times, confidences must be kept and unnecessary information about a group member should not be conveyed when that group member is absent. The absence of a group member, however, can serve as a powerful opportunity for enhancing other group members\\' trust in the leaders. The manner in which the absent member is discussed conveys information to all other members about how they will be treated when they are absent. Generally, the policy should be to protect group members from negative judgments. For example, if a group member blows up and walks out of a session, the leaders can respond to the event with sympathetic explanations of her behavior rather than with critical judgments of her walking out. This same strategy, of course, can be used when all group members are present. It is not unusual for one group member to behave in a fashion that the leaders know will result in negative judgments by other group members. Or other group members may be quite critical of one another. The leaders\\' role here is that of protectors of the accused and the judged. This leader task cannot be over stressed, especially during the client\\'s first year of skills training. Not only does this approach serve to model nonjudgmental observation and description of problematic behavior for group members, but it also conveys to all of the members that when attacked they too will be protected. Other Strategies and Procedures 55 The most useful way to convey expertness and credibility is, of course, to be helpful. Thus, the leaders need to think through skills that have a high likelihood of working with a particular group member. A skill that is working should be highlighted so that the member will also see the benefits. Therapist credibility in standard DBT group skills training is further complicated by the fact that there are two group leaders. In my clinic, the coleader is usually a trainee who, in fact, does not have the expertise of the primary leader. It is essential that the primary leader not undermine the credibility and expertness of the coleader. It is important for the inexperienced coleader to find his or her emotional center and act from there. It is this innercenteredness, rather than any particular set of therapeutic skills, that is most important. The primary leader and coleader do not need to have the same set of skills or to convey expertise in the same areas. The dialectical perspective on the whole is what counts. Relationship Problem Solving Relationship problem solving is the application of general problem-solving strategies to the therapeutic relationship. In individual skills training, that relationship is between the trainer and the client. In group skills training, however, at least four relationships may require problem solving: member versus group leader, group versus group leader, member versus member, and leader versus leader. Not only are there more relationships to balance, but there are also many more issues coming into play. The public nature of the relationships is particularly important. Borderline individuals are exquisitely sensitive to any threat of rejection or criticism; when that rejection or criticism is public, they may experience such overwhelming and intense shame that it completely cuts off any chance of adequate problem solving. Thus, leaders have to be correspondingly sensitive in dealing with relationship problems in first-year DBT skills training groups. The relationship problem solving typical of process therapy groups is simply not possible in the beginning. Therefore, some of this problem solving has to be conducted individually and outside of the group sessions. Otherwise, problems may not be resolved and may escalate to such an extent that members find it impossible to continue in the group. Member versus Group Leader. It is essential for a borderline client to form an attached relationship with at least one of the group leaders if she is to continue in skills training. Without such an attachment, the trials, tribulations, and traumas that frequently arise in skills training will simply overwhelm the client, and she will eventually drop out of therapy. This individual relationship, which is distinct from a leader\\'s relationship to the group as a whole, is enhanced by individual attention given to group members before and after group meetings and during breaks. When interpersonal problems with a group leader arise during the first year, they almost always must be solved outside of group meetings. Depending on the seriousness of the problem, a problem-solving meeting may take place on the phone or in a scheduled individual session before or after a group meeting. Whenever possible, such an individual meeting should be scheduled near in time to the group session, so that it does not take on the character of an individual psychotherapy. It is best to hold the meeting in a comer of the group therapy room. Also, the focus should be kept on the member\\'s problems with the group or with the leader. In these individual meetings, the same relationship problem-solving strategies are utilized as in individual psychotherapy. As a first step, the leader should help the group member observe and describe exactly what the problem is and with whom she has the problem. Sometimes, the problem will be with one or the other of the leaders. The public light of group sessions seems to enhance member sensitivity to even slight rejections or insensitive comments on the part of the leaders. Comments that might not lead to trouble in individual psychotherapy can lead to great problems in group therapy. Thus, if the problem is a leader\\'s behavior, problem solving should be centered around it. At other times, however, the problem is not with a group leader\\'s behavior, but rather with the notion of attending and working in the group at all. Although these problems usually are dealt with in DBT individual psychotherapy (it must be kept in mind that the primary therapist assists the client with all behaviors that interfere with treatment, including those that show up in ancillary or collateral treatment), at times a client may profit from some individual attention from the group leaders also. During these meetings, strategies can be worked out to reduce the stress on the individual member. For example, we have had some group members who simply could not sit through an entire group session without becoming hostile or having a panic attack. In these cases, plans were developed so that when the clients saw that their behavior was about to go out of control, they would get up and leave the session for a few moments\\' break. Such a plan could have been worked out by clients\\' individual psychotherapists as well. Careful attention must be paid to issues of shaping. Borderline clients are prone to indirect communication which at times requires mindreading on their therapists\\' part. How much mindreading should a group skills training therapist engage in, and how much reaching out to a withdrawn group member should occur? 56 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER As with individual psychotherapy, the goal is to require the group member to reach up to her capability and if possible slightly beyond, without requiring so much that she falls back in failure. At the beginning of the year, leaders will often need to telephone group members when they miss sessions or after they storm out of sessions. The key, however, is not to engage in this behavior so reliably that the client begins to expect it, count on it, and become distressed if a leader does not reach out or call. The best approach here is for leaders to be direct in their communications about what they will and won\\'t do. As discussed earlier in this Chapter, the DBT policy is to reach out and call group members when such calling is not reinforcing maladaptive behaviors, and to refrain from reaching out when it will reinforce such behaviors. Obviously, such judgments are difficult. It is especially difficult at the beginning of skills training, when leaders have little idea of the group members\\' respective capabilities; in this case, it is important to make policies clear. In all cases, however, it is essential not to assume that a particular response on the part of the leaders is reinforcing. There is no substitute for observing the consequences of various therapeutic actions. Generally, our policies are as follows. If a member does not show up for a skills training session the person is called immediately by one of the leaders and urged strongly to drop everything and come to the group session immediately. This phone call is designed to cut off the person\\'s ability to avoid a group session. The average borderline client believes that if she doesn\\'t come to a group session, she won\\'t have to deal with group issues; calling her immediately interferes with the avoidance. The phone conversation should be strictly kept to a discussion of how the person can get herself to the session, even if she arrives for only the last half hour. We have at times even offered to send a leader out to pick a person up when her reason for not coming is lack of transportation. In short, the phone call in this situation serves to cut off reinforcement for avoidance rather than to reinforce the avoidance behavior. If a leader waits a few days to call, however, or if the phone call addresses the person\\'s problems, then the call may well reinforce the client\\'s tendency to withdraw rather than confront problems. In this event, the withdrawalleads to positive outreach on the part of the therapist, a positive interaction and sometimes a positive resolution. The dialectical dilemma here is the need to choose between avoiding reinforcing withdrawal and allowing a member to drop out. A leader simply has to face the fact that many borderline clients cannot engage in problem solving alone. Thus, in the interests of shaping, the leader should call and do problem solving and should then highlight that the direct discussion of the problem does result in problem resolution. Once this pattern is stabilized, then the leader can gradually decrease the degree of outreach while simultaneously verbally instructing the individual that she is expected to increase her outreach to the leaders and to the skills training group. Thus, while at the beginning the leader walks all the way over to the client\\'s side of the teeter-totter, he or she needs to grab the client and begin moving back toward the middle. Without this movement, the very problems that outreach is intended to resolve may be exacerbated. During the first 6 months, leaders should expect to spend a considerable amount of time resolving crises related to skills training. The key point, though, is that interventions should be limited to the clients\\' relationship to the group as a whole or to the group leaders. In other crisis situations, leaders should instruct the clients to call their individual therapists. If a leader suspects that phone calls may be reinforcing a client\\'s problem, outcomes of phone calls should be closely observed, and the possibility should be discussed openly with the client as yet another problem to be solved. Because there are two leaders in group skills training, each leader should take great care to observe the consultation-to-the-client approach. That is, one leader should not become an intermediary between a client and the other leader. A leader can, however, work with the client about how to resolve a problem with the other leader. In my experience, it is rare for a group member to be having serious problems with both group leaders at the same time. When this occurs, the DBT individual therapist must be a consultant to the client. The most important idea here is that relationship problems between group members and group leaders should not be ignored. When these problems are serious or long-standing, they usually cannot be resolved during group skills training sessions. In fact, a major difference between our second-and third-year process groups and our first-year skills training groups is this very point. The goal of second-and third-year process groups is for clients to begin developing the ability to engage in relationship problem solving during group sessions. Thus, skills training leaders should expect to spend a considerable amount of time during the first several months of therapy interacting individually with group members before and after sessions and during breaks. In my experience, if a balance can be struck between reaching out when needed and drawing a member in simultaneously, most problems can be resolved. Ignoring the problems almost never makes them go away. The most difficult problem to address and the easiest to ignore is that of the group member who comes to every session and stays for the entire session, but either interacts in a hostile manner or withdraws. Once I had a group member who came and fell asleep during most group sessions. What I wanted to do was reciprocally Other Strategies and Procedures 57 withdraw from the group member. When a leader withdraws from a group member, however, the group member can be expected to withdraw even further and eventually drop out. Addressing these issues directly in group sessions can be so threatening that it is almost never a good idea in the first year, at least not as a first approach. Since the group member is not directly expressing a problem and is not asking for attention, it is the leader\\'s responsibility to approach her and set up an individual consultation before or after a group session or during the break. Failure to initiate an action is usually a sign that a leader is frustrated and is, perhaps not motivated to keep the member in the group. At these times, having a second leader can be an enormous asset. The one leader can prod the other to address the issue. Group versus Group Leaders. When the entire group is engaging in therapy-interfering behavior vis-avis the group leaders, the problem cannot, of course, be dealt with individually; it is a group problem. When should this problem be addressed directly, and when should it be ignored? An attempt to address the problem directly often backfires. Once group members have withdrawn or begun to interact in a hostile manner, they are often unable to stop the withdrawal in order to process the problem. Any move on the leaders\\' part to address the problem is viewed as criticizing further or as creating more conflict, and the group simply withdraws further. It is usually better either to ignore the group withdrawal or hostility, or to comment on it briefly without pushing the issue and then focus on drawing out individual group members. At this point, it is essential to be able to cajole, distract, and otherwise respond to the problem in a relatively indirect manner. Ifleaders reciprocate with hostility, coldness, and withdrawal the problem will increase. This is perhaps one of the most difficult situations that group skills training leaders must face. Unfortunately, it is also a very common situation in the beginning months of group skills training. It is a bit like trying to walk through quicksand-pulling with all one\\'s strength to get one foot up, and then putting it down again in front of the other. Although it is exhausting and frustrating, the leaders\\' refusal to give up or give in and reciprocate with hostility or obvious frustration communicates clearly to clients that no matter what they do or how withdrawn they are, the group will progress and continue. On the other hand, leaders can do only so much with a group if the group members are withdrawn and not talking. In these situations, it is helpful to be able to read the clients\\' minds. It is sometimes a good idea for the leaders to have a dialogue (out loud) with one another, trying to figure out the problem. Although over time the group members should develop the ability to resolve group stalemates with the leaders via problem solving, at the beginning progress is usually not visible. It is absolutely essential in these situations that leaders not let their own judgments and hostile interpretations have free rein. Compassion and empathy are essential. Member versus Member. Not infrequently, there is conflict between individual members in a skills training group. In my experience, encouraging group members to discuss their problems with one another openly in group almost always results in disaster. Again, borderline clients, at least at their most dysfunctional, simply cannot tolerate criticism in a group setting; thus, member-to-member problems need to be dealt with privately until the collective ability to solve problems publicly is increased. In private interactions with a group member who is distressed (before or after a session or during a break), a leader\\'s primary role is to soothe the distressed member and to explain the offending member in a sympathetic manner. If criticisms or memberto-member conflicts arise during a session, a leader\\'s best strategy is to serve as the third point or fulcrum. Rather than suggesting that the conflicting members talk with one another to resolve their differences or hurt feelings, the leader should publicly defend the offending member while simultaneously empathizing with the offended member. If the conflict is over procedural issues, problem solving can go forward in the group session. For example, a conflict arose in one of our skills training groups between one member\\'s need for the window curtains to be closed and other group members\\' need for the curtains to be open. Such conflicts should be mediated by a group leader but can be discussed in group sessions. Many such conflicts will arise over the course of the year. A leader\\'s role in these is somewhat like a parent\\'s or teacher\\'s role with a group of problem children. The sensitivities of each individual member must be respected; a leader must resist the tendency at times to sacrifice one member for the go~d of the whole. Leader versus Leader. Perhaps the most damaging conflict in conducting DBT group skills training is that which can arise between the two group leaders. Smooth coordination can be especially difficult when the leaders have different theoretical perspectives, have different views of how psychotherapy groups should be conducted, or wish for a different role in the skills training than the role assigned. These issues need to be resolved outside of the skills training sessions, preferably before the first session. When conflicts arise in sessions, the usual procedure is for the coleader to defer to the primary leader during the session and argue his or her case afterwards. 58 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER A problem arises when the coleader is better tuned in both to group members and to the unfolding process than the primary leaders. This is a situation where the DBT supervision/consultation team can be quite useful. No matter what the difference in experience between leaders may be, it is important for them not to fall into the trap of who is \"right\" and who is \"wrong.\" Not only is this approach dialectically flawed, but it is rarely useful in resolving a conflict. A related situation that sometimes occurs is that when one group leader is absent, group members complain about the absent leader to the other leader. How should the leader who is present react? The most important thing is not to become split off from the absent leader. The same strategy used when an absent member is being discussed should be employed. That is, the present leader should portray the absent leader in a sympathetic light, while simultaneously validating the concerns of the members present. It is a tricky line to walk, but essential nonetheless. Relationship Generalization The principles of relationship generalization in DBT skills training are the same as those in DBT individual psychotherapy. Leaders must be vigilant in noticing when interpersonal relationships within the group are similar to problems individuals are having outside of group sessions. A number of typical problems show up in group skills training. Borderline individuals\\' exquisite sensitivity to criticism and the rapid onset of extreme shame almost always create problems; the public nature of the group setting simply exacerbates these problems. In addition, the group setting is often reminiscent of family interactions. Problems that individuals have with their families are likely to show up in the group. Many members have problems in coping with authority figures, especially when the authority figures are telling them what to do. Therefore, at least some patients will have problems with doing homework practice. At other times, problems concern whether individual members will admit to progress. The problems of borderline individuals in regard to competence and the appearance of competence are discussed extensively in Chapters 3 and 10 of the text. The inability of many borderline individuals to put personal problems on a shelf, so to speak, and attend to the skills training material is quite similar to their difficulties outside of skills training in work or school settings. Their inability to remember to practice skills (or to get themselves to practice even when they do remember), and then to punish or berate themselves in a judgmental fashion, is indicative of their general difficulties with self-management. Their tendency to withdraw emotionally and become silent when any conflict occurs during group sessions is typical of their difficulties in dealing with conflict outside of the group. An often unstated, but particularly difficult, problem of many group members is their inability to shut themselves off emotionally from other group members\\' pain. Consequent exacerbation of their own painful emotions can result in either panic attacks, hostile behavior, or complete emotional withdrawal. As can be seen from just this partiallist, skills training in a group setting can be counted on to bring up many of the everyday problems that borderline individuals have. Using relationship generalization strategies in group skills training sessions, however, can be quite tricky. The basic idea is to help a member see how her everyday problems are showing up within the skills training group, without at the same time invalidating her real problems with the group or with specific members. It is important that leaders not be overinclined to attribute all within-therapy problems to prior problems that members have rather than to inadequacies in the group format or to the leaders\\' application of the treatment. Borderline client\\'s difficulties in accepting negative feedback or implied criticism suggest that leaders must be extremely sensitive in applying the relationship generalization strategies. In my own experience, the best way to do this is to take an individual problem, make it into a universal problem, and then discuss it in that context. The astute group member may figure out that she is the one is being talked to, but still it is not a public humiliation. The first step in relationship generalization is to relate the within-session relationship problem to general problems that need work both in and out of the skills training group. Just making this connection (an insight strategy; see Chapter 9 of the text) can sometimes be therapeutic. The next step is to use problem-solving strategies to develop alternative response patterns for members to try. The key in relationship generalization, in skills training as in psychotherapy, is to plan for rather than to assume generalization. Planning, at a minimum, requires discussion with the group members. The discussion should also include developing homework in which clients can practice applying new skills to everyday situations. Since this is the essential idea undergirding skills training and homework practice anyway, relationship generalization is especially compatible with DBT skills training. The next five chapters present the outline (Chapter 6) and content (Chapters 7-10) of the four skills training modules. The handouts and homework sheets to be given to skills training clients are all together at the end of the book to facilitate efficient photocopying. 6 Session-by-Session Outlines for Psychosocial Skills Training Instructional material in skills training, especially in a group context should be presented by the skills trainers at a pace adapted to the level of understanding of the clients. At periodic intervals during each skills training session, participants should be asked \"comprehension\" questions designed to test whether they understand key points being communicated. Misunderstood material should be reviewed. Since the pace of each session will differ, as will the overall pace for particular individuals or groups, instructional content is not divided into segments for particular sessions. In order to facilitate the coverage of all of the material by the end of the time scheduled for the particular module, however, the skills training leaders should construct lesson plans for each session and should attempt to cover the designated material during the session time allotted. In my experience, the first time therapists teach these skill modules the amount of material feels overwhelming, and the therapists tend to spend too much time on early parts of a module and then have too little time later to cover other material that may be more important. However, what actually is important will necessarily vary with different individuals or groups, depending on their experience and skill levels. Therefore, the best strategy the first time through is to cut each module arbitrarily into sections corresponding to the exact number of weeks you have and try to get through as much of each section as possible. That experience will dictate how to time the modules the second time, and so on. When I teach therapists how to do DBT skills training, I usually recommend that trainers first teach the material in the skills modules in the order given in this manual. After the first run-through, modifications in content and order can be made to better suit the particular situation. One goal of the skills training sessions is to impart information about particular coping strategies to participants. A second, equally important goal is to elicit from the participants rules and strategies for effective coping that they have learned in the particular situations they encounter. Thus, skills training should be taught so that the instructional material is augmented as a result of each discussion. Participants should be encouraged to take notes and to expand the handout materials furnished during sessions with their own and other participants\\' ideas. Whenever a particularly good strategy is presented in a session, all should be instructed to write it down in the appropriate space on their handouts (including the skills training leaders). The strategy should then be included in practice and review, just as are strategies presented initially by the leaders. When therapists are using these guidelines for the first time, it can be helpful to go through them first and highlight key points to be covered. I have tried to do this as well by using bold face type for key topics. For the first session in each module, when therapists are presenting or reviewing the general rationale of skills training, they can use the outline in this chapter as a guide in actually conducting the session. For the remaining chapters, the content outlines in Chapters 7-10 will be needed. Session I: Orientation to Skills Training In a group context, the purpose of the first session is to introduce members to one another and to the skills training leaders; to orient members to the structural aspects of the therapy (e.g., format, rules, meeting times); 59 60 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER and to orient them to the leaders\\' theoretical approach to BPD and goals for the class. This session is repeated at the beginning of each 8-week module. However, after the first orientation class, reorientation may be abbreviated if there are no new members starting the new module. If there are new members, the leaders should try to get old members to conduct as much of the orientation as possible. In either case, if orientation is concluded before the session ends, the leaders should proceed to the material for Session 2 (core mindfulness skills). Material in this session covering format, timing, fees, rules, use of the telephone, and so on should be changed to reflect particular circumstances. Thus, this section provides an outline of topics to be covered, but the content of at least some of the topics can be easily modified. (If a therapist is teaching skills individually, most of the information will be the same. The structured aspects, however, will be quite different, since many concern relationships among group members and between group members and leaders.) I. Review consent forms for therapy. Be sure consent forms are signed. Fill out relevant research and/or assessment forms. II. Ask each participant to introduce herself with her name and a brief statement of why she is here (and, for a previous participant, how long she has been in treatment program). Leaders: Introduce yourselves and give information about yourselves and why you are leading skills training. III. Give general goals. A. Therapy/skills training for clients. B. Income, other goals of therapists. C. Training of therapists (coleaders) (if applicable). D. Research (if applicable). IV. Review General Handout I: Goals of Skills Training A. General goal of skills training: To learn and refine skills in changing behavioral, emotional, and thinking patterns associated with problems in living that are causing misery and distress. B. Specific goals: Discuss relationship of borderline characteristics to specific skills training modules. (See Chapter 5 of the text and Chapter 1 of this manual for discussions of this point.) Get feedback from participants on whether or not each behavioral pattern is characteristic of them. 1. Interpersonal chaos: Discuss intense, unstable relationships; trouble maintaining relationships; panic, anxiety, and dread over relationships ending; frantic attempts to avoid abandonment. Interpersonal effectiveness training focuses on this characteristic of BPD. However, it focuses specifically on learning to deal with conflict situations, to get what one wants and needs, and to say no to unwanted requests and demands. It focuses specifically on doing this in a manner that maintains self-respect and others\\' liking and/or respect. Thus, it does not focus on all aspects of relationships. 2. Labile affect, moods, emotions: Discuss extreme emotional sensitivity, ups and downs, moodiness, intense emotional reactions; chronic depression; problems with anger (either overcontrolled or undercontrolled). Emotion regulation training focuses on enhancing control of emotions, even though complete emotional control cannot be achieved. Explain: \"To a certain extent we are who we are, and emotionality is part of us. But we can get more control and perhaps can learn to modulate some emotions to be a bit more mellow.\" 3. Impulsiveness: Discuss problems with alcohol, drugs, eating, spending, sex, fast driving, etc. Also, discuss parasuicidal behavior (see Chapter 1 of the text for definition), suicide threats. Distress tolerance training focuses on learning to tolerate distress. Discuss the connection between inability to tolerate distress and impulsive behavior which very often functions to reduce intolerable distress. 4. Confusion about self, cognitive dysregulatlon: Discuss problems experiencing or identifying a self; a pervasive sense of emptiness; problems in maintaining one\\'s own feelings, opinions, decisions when around others. Also discuss brief, nonpsychotic cognitive disturbances (depersonalization, dissociation, delusions). Core mindfulness training focuses on learning to go within to find oneself and on learning to observe oneself. C. Get feedback. Session-by-Session Outlines 61 V. Discuss format of skills training. A. Describe order and length of modules. B. Describe use of session time (half for discussing homework practice, half for presenting new material). e. Make it clear that neither time nor format allows for discussion of personal problems unrelated to using behavioral skills. Personal problems should be discussed with individual psychotherapist. Note that this is not due to lack of compassion, but to need to use session time to teach coping skills. D. Discuss use of telephone calls to skills training leaders. Calls should only pertain to sessions (either missing a session or some other pertinent topic). Personal crises (including suicidal crises) should be discussed with individual psychotherapist, crisis clinic, emergency room, relatives, friends. Give phone numbers to contact group leaders. VI. Review General Handout 2: Guidelines for Skills Training. A. Discuss and get each participant to agree to rules. (See Chapter 3 of this manual for a discussion of each of the rules.) B. Discuss any rules not on list. e. Discuss what an \"excused\" session is (e.g., session missed because of physical illness, family emergency, vacation out of town, wedding, funeral) and what an \"unexcused\" session is (e.g., session missed because of fatigue, bad mood, psychiatric hospitalization, solvable problem). Session 2: Core Mindfulness Skills I. Discuss any questions from last week. II. Introduce new participants. A. Review DBT skills training rules. Have other participants explain guidelines to new ones. 1m. Review diary cards and how to fill out. A. On the front of the card, only the last column (rating degree of behavioral skills practice) will be discussed in sessions. All other sections on front of card will be discussed during individual psychotherapy. Encourage those who have non-DBT individual psychotherapists to discuss diary card and its contents with their individual therapists. The entire back of the card (pertaining to skills) will be discussed in sessions each week. Tell clients to bring their card every week! B. Degree of behavioral skills practice (front of diary card) is rated according to scale at bottom of card. Any adaptive, active problem solving is considered a skill. Thus, participants should rate their use of skills, including use of any and all coping skills not taught in class. Note that use of maladaptive problem solving (drinking, self-cutting, etc.) does not count as using skills. e. On back of diary card, participants should circle each skill each day if they make any attempt to practice the skill. Use this as an opportunity to discuss the role of self-monitoring, feedback, and reinforcement in behavior change. (See Chapter 9 of the text for a discussion of these points.) D. Discuss crucial importance of practice in learning and change. E. Troubleshoot problems in filling out diary cards. Engage in problem solving for difficulties that arise. F. Discuss confidentiality of cards, ways to keep confidential. Give out alternative cards with only acronyms, if necessary. 1 Suggest that participants not put real names on cards. IV. Introduce, discuss, arid practice core mindfulness skills (see Chapter 7 of this manual). V. Summarize key points of content discussed during class. VI. Develop practice commitments. A. Go around and discuss with each person what she will practice during the coming week. Participants can choose a particular skill to practice across a wide array of situations, or they can pick a recurrent problem situation to practice in. In the latter case, the objective is to use a variety of skills in the problem situation. B. Make an effort to get each participant to agree to practi<;e observing and describing during the first few weeks. Over subsequent modules, each person should focus some practice o~ each of the six mindfulness skills. C. Troubleshoot problems in implementing practice. 62 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER VII. Conduct session wind-down. A. Select one of the wind-down exercises described in Chapter 3 of this manual. During this session, instruct participants in how to do winddown. Give rationale for using a wind-down. B. Suggest that participants bring tapes of favorite music to listen to at end of skills training sessions. Work out a scheme for rotating task. Session 3-7: Specific Module Skills I. Discuss any questions from last week. II. Check in with individuals who did not attend last session. A. Discuss reasons for not attending session(s). B. Briefly review content of previous session. Have other participants briefly explain previous material to ones who were absent. III. Review homework practice. A. Go from person to person, asking each whether she practiced any new (or old) skills during the previous week. Use therapy-interfering behavior strategies (see Chapter 15 of text and Chapter 5 of this manual) if she did not practice. Use problem-solving strategies (see Chapter 9 of text and Chapter 5 of this manual) if she practiced but couldn\\'t implement skills, or if she did implement them but they did not help. Blend confrontation, shaping, and validation. Highlight and reinforce success. B. Be alert to a person\\'s always using the same skill and not practicing any new skills. The objective here is for everyone to develop the ability to implement each skill. If once a person has a skill capability, she then chooses never to use it in her daily life, this is OK. IV. Take a midpoint break (aher first hour or so). V. Present, discuss, and practice skills content for specific module (see Chapters 7-10 of this manual). VI. Summarize content presented. VII. Develop practice commitments. A. Go around and discuss with each person what she will practice during the coming week. Participants can choose a particular skill to practice acrpss a wide array of situations, or they can pick a recurrent problem situation to practice in. In the latter case, the objective is to use a variety of skills in the problem situation. B. Check that practice plans and agreements are in line with the homework sheets given out for that particular session. C. Troubleshoot problems in implementing practice. VIII. Conduct session wind-down. Session 8: Last Session I-III. First hour: Same as sessions 3-7. IV. Take a midpoint break. V. Review skills that have been taught during this module. VI. Review skills from previous modules. A. Briefly review essential skills in previous modules if any members have been in those modules. B. Ask participants to supplement review by listing any skills from previous modules that they found especially helpful or that they need more practice in. VII. Discuss pros and cons, uses and misuses, helpfulness and nonhelpfulness of different skills, including skills from previous modules. Compare notes on use among participants. VIII. Discuss skill generalization across situations and contexts of participants\\' lives. IX. Say good-bye to any individuals leaving skills training. Discuss termination issues. (See Chapter 4 of this manual and Chapter 14 of the text for further discussion of termination.) X. Conduct session and module wind-down. During last class of each module, wind-down should consist of observations about the entire 8-week series of classes. Focus on observations about how the weeks went, how sessions went, and how participants felt and feel about the module. Note 1. Some individuals do not want to use diary cards that can be understood by anyone else if they are found. In these instances, revised diary cards that use acronyms instead of the names of skills and other items can be employed. Alternatively, a client can use a number or pseudonym instead of her real name on the cards. 7 Core Mindfulness Skills Mindfulness skills are central to DBT (hence the label \"core\" mindfulness skills). They are the first skills taught and are listed on the diary cards that clients fill out every week. These are the only skills that are highlighted the entire year; they are reviewed at the beginning of each of the other three skill modules. The skills are psychological and behavioral versions of meditation practices from Eastern spiritual training. I have drawn most heavily from the practice of Zen, but the skills are compatible with most Western contemplative and Eastern meditation practices. In DBT, three primary states of mind are presented: \"reasonable mind;\\' \"emotion mind;\\' and \"wise mind;\\' A person is in \"reasonable mind\" when she is approaching knowledge intellectually, is thinking rationally and logically, attends to empirical facts, is planful in her behavior, focuses her attention, and is \"cool\" in her approach to problems. The person is in \"emotion mind\" when her thinking and behavior are controlled primarily by her current emotional state. In \"emotion mind;\\' cognitions are \"hot\"; reasonable, logical thinking is difficult; facts are amplified or distorted to be congruent with current affect; and the energy of behavior is also congruent with the current emotional state. \"Wise mind\" is the integration of \"emotion mind\" and \"reasonable mind;\\' as I have noted in Chapter 5 of this manual. It also and goes beyond them: \"Wise mind\" adds intuitive knowing to emotional experiencing and logical analysis. Mindfulness skills are the vehicles for balancing \"emotion mind\" and \"reasonable mind\" to achieve \"wise mind;\\' There are three \"what\" skills (observing, describing, and participating) and three \"how\" skills (taking a nonjudgmental stance, focusing on one thing in the moment, and being effective). Mindfulness \"What\" Skills The mindfulness \"what\" skills include learning to observe, to describe, and to participate. The goal is to develop a lifestyle of participating with awareness; an assumption of DBT is that participation without awareness is a characteristic of impulsive and mood dependent behaviors. Generally, observing and describing one\\'s own behavioral responses are only necessary when new behavior is being learned, there is some sort of problem, or a change is necessary. For example, beginning piano players pay close attention to the location of their hands and fingers, and may either count beats out loud or name the keys and chords they are playing. As skill improves, however, such observing and describing cease. But if a habitual mistake is made after a piece is learned, the player may have to revert to observing and describing until a new pattern has been learned. Learning to drive a stick-shift car, to dance, and to type are other familiar examples of this principle. The first \"what\" skill is observing-that is, attending to events, emotions, and other behavioral responses, without necessarily trying to terminate them when painful or prolong them when pleasant. What the client learns here is to allow herself to experience with awareness, in the moment, whatever is happening, rather than leaving a situation or trying to terminate an emotion. Generally, the ability to attend to events requires a corresponding ability to step back from the event. Observing an event is separate or different from the event itself. Observing walking and walking are two different responses; observing thinking and thinking are two different responses; observing one\\'s own heartbeat and the heart\\'s beating are two different responses. This 63 64 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER focus on \"experiencing the moment\" is based on Eastern psychological approaches, as well as on Western notions of nonreinforced exposure as a method of extinguishing automatic avoidance and fear responses. A second mindfulness \"what\" skill is that of describing events and personal responses in words. The ability to apply verbal labels to behavioral and environmental events is essential for both communication and selfcontrol. Learning to describe requires that a person learn not to take emotions and thoughts literally-that is, as literal reflections of environmental events. For example, feeling afraid does not necessarily mean that a situation is threatening to life or welfare. Many people, including borderline individuals, confuse emotional responses with precipitating events. Physical components of fear (\"I feel my stomach muscles tightening, my throat constricting\") may be confused with perceptions of the environment (\"I am starting an exam in school\") to produce a dysfunctional thought (\"I am going to fail the exam\"). Thoughts are often taken literally; that is, thoughts (\"I feel unloved\") are confused with facts (\"I am unloved\"). One of the principal aims of cognitive therapy is to test the association of thoughts with their corresponding environmental events. The third mindfulness \"what\" skill is the ability to participate without self-consciousness. A person who is participating is entering completely into the activities of the current moment, without separating herself from ongoing events and interactions. The quality of action is spontaneous; the interaction between the individual and the environment is smooth and based in some part on habit. Participating can, of course, be mindless. We have all had the experience of driving a complicated path to home as we concentrated on something else, arriving home without any awareness whatsoever of how we got there. But it can also be mindful. A good example of mindful participating is that of the skillful athlete who responds flexibly but smoothly to the demands of the task with alertness and awareness, but not with selfconsciousness. Mindlessness is participating without attention to the task; mindfulness is participating with attention. Mindfulness \"How\" Skills The other three mindfulness skills have to do with how one attends, describes, and participates; they include taking a nonjudgmental stance, focusing on one thing in the moment, and being effective (doing what works). As taught in DBT, taking a nonjudgmental stance means just that-taking a nonevaluative approach, judging something as neither good nor bad. It does not mean going from a negative judgment to a positive judgment. Although borderline individuals tend to judge both themselves and others in either excessively positive terms (idealization) or excessively negative terms (devaluation), the position here is not that they should be more balanced in their judgments, but rather that judging should in most instances be dropped altogether. This is a very subtle point but a very important one. The problem with judging is that, for instance, a person who can be \"worthwhile\" can always become \"worthless:\\' Instead, DBT stresses a focus on the consequences of behavior and events. For example, a person\\'s behavior may lead to painful consequences for herself or for others, or the outcome of events may be destructive. A nonjudgmental approach observes these consequences, and may suggest changing the behaviors or events, but would not necessarily add a label of \"bad\" to them. Mindfulness in its totality has to do with the quality of awareness that a person brings to activities. The second \"how\" is to learn to focus the mind and awareness in the current moment\\'s activity, rather than splitting attention among several activities or between a current activity and thinking about something else. Achieving such a focus requires control of attention, a capability that most borderline individuals lack. Often borderline clients are distracted by thoughts and images of the past, worries about the future, ruminative thoughts about troubles, or current negative moods. They are sometimes unable to put their troubles away and focus attention on the task at hand. When they do become involved in a task, their attention is often divided. This problem is readily observable in their difficulties in attending to skills training sessions. The clients need to learn how to focus their attention on one task or activity at a time, engaging in it with alertness, awareness, and wakefulness. The third \"how\" goal, being effective, is directed at reducing the client\\'s tendency at times to be more concerned with what is \"right\" than with doing what is actually needed or called for in a particular situation. Effectiveness is the opposite of \"cutting off your nose to spite your face:\\' As our clients often say, it is \"playing the game\" or \"doing what works.\" From an Eastern meditation perspective, focusing on effectiveness is \"using skillful means:\\' The inability to let go of \"being right\" in favor of achieving goals is, of course, related to borderline individuals\\' experiences with invalidating environments. A central issue for many clients is whether they can indeed trust their own perceptions, judgments, and decisions-that is, whether they can expect their own actions to be correct or \"right.\" However, taken to an extreme, an emphasis on principle over outcome can often result in the clients\\' being disappointed or alienating others. In the end, we all have to \"give in\" some of the time. Borderline clients at times find it much easier Core Mindfulness Skills 65 to give up being right for being effective when it is viewed as a skillful response rather than as a \"giving in.\" Homework Practice In contrast to the other three modules, the mindfulness skills module does not have any homework practice sheets. Clients are simply asked to practice the skills learned so far during every week. As noted earlier, all of the mindfulness skills are listed on the back of the diary cards; members should be instructed to circle each skill each day that they make any attempt to practice their skills. If individual clients wish to, they can keep a written diary of their efforts and bring their notes to skills training sessions. Content Outline I. Orient clients to skills to be learned in this module and the rationale for their importance. A. Explain focus of core mindfulness skills: \"Learning to be in control of your own mind, instead of letting your mind be in control of you.\" Discussion Point: To a certain extent, being in control of one\\'s mind is actually learning to be in control of attention processes -that is, what one pays attention to and how long one pays attention to it. Draw from participants examples of how their inability to control their attention creates problems. Examples may include inability to stop thinking about things, (e.g., the past, the future, current emotional pain or hurt, physical pain); inability to concentrate on a task when it is important to do so; inability to focus on another person or to stay on a task because of distraction. B. Mindfulness skills requires practice, practice, practice. Lecture Point: Relate learning to take control of one\\'s mind to Western and Eastern traditions of meditation developed over thousands of years. All rely on practice. Relate to yoga master\\'s ability to withstand pain, walk on red-hot coals, etc. Note to Leaders: Sometimes individuals will be put off by references to Eastern meditation practice. You need to be very sensitive to this point. You can either divorce meditation from any religion or relate it to all religions. (1) Meditation is now commonly used in the treatment of chronic physical pain and stress management programs, and is increasingly being used in treatment of emotional disorders. Thus, meditation can be practiced outside of any spiritual or religious context. (2) Eastern meditation practice is very similar to Christian contemplative prayer, Jewish mystical tradition, and forms of prayer taught in other religions. Discussion Point: Discuss with participants the crucial importance of behavioral practice in learning any new skill. Behavioral practice includes practicing control of one\\'s mind, attention, overt behavior, body, and emotions. Draw from participants their beliefs about the necessity of practice in learning: \"Can you learn without practice?\" II. Review Mindfulness Handout I: Taking Hold of Your Mind: States of Mind. A. Reasonable mind. Explain: \"This is your rational, thinking, logical mind. It is that part of you that plans and evaluates things logically. It is your cool part:\\' Lecture Point: Reasonable mind can be very beneficial. Without it, people could not build homes, roads, or cities; they could not follow instructions; they could not solve logical problems, do science, or run meetings. Lecture Point: Reasonable mind is easier when people feel good, and much harder when they don\\'t. Discussion Point: When other people say that \"if you could just think straight you would be all right,\" they mean that \"if you could be in reasonable mind you would do OK:\\' Elicit from participants times other people have said or implied that if they would just not distort, exaggerate, or misperceive things, they would have far fewer problems. How many times have participants said the same thing to themselves? Isn\\'t there some truth to these positions? B. Emotion mind. Explain: \"You are in emotion mind when your emotions are in control-when they influence and control your thinking and your behavior.\" Lecture Point: Emotion mind can be very beneficial. Intense love fills history books as motivation for relationships. Intense love (or intense hate) has fueled wars. Intense devotion or desire motivates staying with very hard tasks, sacrificing oneself for others (e.g., mothers running through fires for their children). Lecture Point: A certain amount of emotion mind is desirable. Borderline individuals have more than most; they are the \"dramatic\" folks of the world and will always be so. People high in emotion mind are often passionate about people, causes, beliefs, etc. Lecture Point: Problems with emotion mind occur when the results are positive in the short term but negative in the long term, or when the experience itself is very painful, or leads to other painful states and events 66 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER (e.g., anxiety and depression can be painful in themselves). Lecture Point: Emotion mind is exacerbated by (1) illness; (2) sleep deprivation, tiredness; (3) drugs, alcohol; (4) hunger, bloating, overeating, poor nutrition; (5) environmental stress (too many demands); and (6) environmental threats. Elicit other factors from participants. Discussion Point: Discuss pros and cons of both types of mind. Draw from participants their experience of reasonable mind and of emotion mind. C. Wise mind. Explain: \"Wise mind is the integration of emotion mind and reasonable mind. You cannot overcome emotion mind with reasonable mind. Nor can you create emotions with reasonableness. You must go within and integrate the two.\" Note to Leaders: You need not cover each of these points every time through; give just enough to get your point across. You will be covering this section many times. Expand on your points a bit more each time through. (See Chapter 7 of the text for a fuller discussion of wise mind.) Lecture Point: Wise mind is that part of each person that can know and experience truth. It is where the person knows something to be true or valid. It is almost always quiet; it has a certain peace. It is where the person knows something in a centered way. Lecture Point: Wisdom, wise mind, or wise knowing depends upon integration of all ways of knowing something: knowing by observing, knowing by analyzing logically, knowing by what we experience in our bodies (kinetic and sensory experience), knowing by what we do, and knowing by intuition (May, 1982). Lecture Point: Wise mind is similar to intuition. (Or, perhaps, intuition is part of wise mind.) It is knowing that is more than reasoning and more than what is observed directly. It has qualities of direct experience; immediate knowing; understanding the meaning, significance, or truth of an event without having to analyze it intellectually (Deikman, 1982); and \"feelings of deepening coherence\" (Polanyi, 1958). Lecture Point: Everyone has wise mind; some simply have never experienced it. Also, no one is in wise mind all the time. Discussion Point: Get feedback from participants on their own experiences of wise mind. Note to Leaders: Clients will sometimes say that they don\\'t have wise mind. You must cheerlead here. Believe in clients\\' abilities to find wise mind. Wise mind is like having a heart; everyone has one, whether they experience it or not. Use the \"well\" analogy below. Lecture Point: Explain: \"Wise mind is like a deep well in the ground. The water at the bottom of the well, the entire underground ocean is wise mind. But on the way down there are often trap doors that impede progress. Sometimes the trap doors are so cleverly built that you actually believe that there is no water at the bottom of the well. The trap door may look like the bottom of the welL Perhaps it is locked and you need a key. Perhaps it is nailed shut and you need a hammer, or it is glued shut and you need a chisel.\" Discussion Point: Elicit examples from participants. For example, sometimes a person may reach wisdom only when suddenly confronted by another person. Or someone else may say something insightful that unlocks an inner door. Lecture Point: Wise mind is sometimes experienced in the center of the body (the belly), or in the center of the head, or between the eyes. Sometimes a person can find it by following the breath in and out. Practice Exercise: Have participants go into themselves and experience wise mind. Explain: \"Finding wise mind is like riding a bike; you can only learn it by experience.\" Instruct them to follow their breath (attend to their breath coming in and out) as they breathe naturally and deeply, and after some time to try to let their attention settle into their center, at the bottom of their inhalation. That very centered point is wise mind. Have participants share their experiences. Discussion Point: Wise mind may be the calm that follows the storm -an experience immediately following a crisis or enormous chaos. It is suddenly getting to the heart of a matter, seeing or knowing something directly and clearly. It is grasping the whole picture when before only parts were understood. It is \"feeling\" the right choice in a dilemma, when the feeling comes from deep within rather from a current emotional state. Elicit similar experiences and other examples from participants. D. Emotion mind versus wise mind: how to know the difference. Lecture Point: Emotion mind and wise mind both have a quality of \"feeling\" something to be the case. The intensity of emotions can generate experiences of certainty that mimic the stable, cool certainty of wisdom. Continue the analogy above: \\':.\\\\fter a heavy rain, water can collect on a trap door within the well. You may then confuse the still water on the trap door with the deep ocean at the bottom of the welL\" Discussion Point: There is no simple solution here. Suggest: \"If intense emotion is obvious, suspect emotion mind. Give it time; if certainty remains, especially when you are feeling calm and secure, suspect wise mind:\\' Ask participants for other ideas on how to tell the difference. Core Mindfulness Skills 67 III. Review Mindfulness Handout 2: Taking Hold of Your Mind: \"What\" Skills. A. Describe two types of mindfulness skills: (1) \"what\" skills (i.e., what to do) and (2) \"how\" skills (i.e., how to do it). B. With respect to \"what\" skills, it is very important to point out that a person can only do one thing at a time-observe, or describe, or participate, but not all three at once. In contrast, the \"how\" skills can be applied all at once. C. Observing. Explain: \"Observing is sensing or experiencing without describing or labeling the experience. It is noticing or attending to something.\" Practice Exercises: Have participants try some of the following. 1. \"Experience your fanny on the chair.\" 2. \"Experience your hand on a cool surface (e.g., a table or chair) or a warm surface (e.g., your other hand).\" 3. \"Attend to and try to sense your stomach, your shoulders.\" 4. \"Stroke just above your upper lip, then stop stroking and notice how long it takes before you can\\'t sense your upper lip any longer.\" S. \"\\'Watch\\' in your mind the first two thoughts that . come m. \" 6. \"Imagine that your mind is a conveyor belt, and that thoughts andlor feelings are coming down the belt. Put each thought andlor feeling in a box near the belt.\" 7. \"Imagine that your mind is the sky and thoughts, sensations andlor feelings are clouds. Gently notice each cloud as it drifts by (or scurries by).\" 8. \"If you find yourself describing thoughts, sensations, or feelings, \\'step back\\', in your mind so to speak, and observe your describing.\" 9. \"If you find yourself distracted, observe that; observe yourself as you become aware that you were distracted.\" Note to Leaders: It is essential to help clients observe in a nonattached way. Thus, whatever happens in their minds is \"grist for the mill;\\' so to speak. No matter what they do, they can just \"step back\" and observe. Get feedback. Work with clients until they get the idea of observing. Check how long each person can observe. It is common to have to start and restart many times in the course of 1 or 2 minutes. Lecture Point: Remind participants to step back within themselves, not outside of themselves to observe. Observing is not dissociating. If an individual has difficulty staying inside instead of going outside of herself, suggest that she try the following: \"Imagine that the place you go outside of yourself is a flower. The flower is connected to your center by a long stem. The center is the root of the flower. Imagine coming down the stem to the root. Do this each time.\" D. Describing. Explain: \"Describing is using words to represent what you observe.\" Lecture Point: Observing is like sensing; there are no words. Observing is noticing and attending. Describing is a reaction to observing; it is labeling what is observed. Discussion Point: Discuss the difference between describing and observing. Again, observing is like sensing without words. Describing is using words or thoughts to label what is observed. Discussion Point: Discuss how describing a thought as a thought requires one to notice that it is a thought instead of a fact. Give examples of the differences between thinking \"I am a jerk\" and being a jerk. Get feedback. Get lots of examples. It is crucial that clients get this distinction. Practice Exercise: Have participants practice observing thoughts and labeling them as thoughts. Suggest labeling them into categories (e.g., \"thoughts about myself;\\' \"thoughts about others;\\' etc.) Use the conveyor belt exercise above, but this time as thoughts and feelings come down the belt, have participants sort them into categories: \"For example, you could have one box for thoughts (of any sort), one box for sensations in your body, one box for urges to do something (for example, urges to stop).\" Discussion Point: Discuss the difference between describing and judging. Judging is labeling something in an evaluative way. Describing is \"just the facts.\" E. Participating. Explain: \"Participating is entering wholly into an activity, becoming one with the activity. It is throwing yourself into something. It is spontaneous behavior to a certain extent, although you can also do it mindfully.\" Discussion Point: Note that participating is the ultimate goal. The only reason we observe and describe is to understand and improve things. Share examples of participating (e.g., driving a car): \"When we switch cars to one with a different way of driving or if we go to England and have to drive on the left side of the road, we suddenly need to stop and observe and describe.\" Gather other examples from clients. 68 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER F. Discuss relationship of the three skills. Discuss with clients which \"what\" skill (observing, describing, participating) is their strength and which is their weakness. The one they have most difficulty with is the one to practice the most. IV. Review Mindfulness Handout 3: Taking Hold of Your Mind: \"How\" Skills. A. Nonjudgmentally. The goal here is to take a nonjudgmental stance when observing, describing, and participating. Judging is any labeling or evaluating of something as good or bad, as valuable or not, as worthwhile or worthless. The essence of it is the valuing of things as more or less \"good\" or \"bad:\\' An important mindfulness skill is not judging things in this manner. Lecture Point: Point out the difference between judging what a person does, which is applying a label of \"good\" or \"bad;\\' and describing the consequences of what a person does. Consequences may be painful, destructive, or harmful. A person who stops judging can still observe or predict consequences. Sometimes judging is a shorthand way of describing consequences. For example, saying \"This piece of meat is bad\" is a shorthand way of saying \"It is filled with bacteria and may make you sick if you eat it:\\' Discussion Point: Get examples of the difference between judging and noticing consequences: \"Your behavior is terrible\" versus \"Your behavior is hurting me\" or \"What you are doing is going to result in my getting hurt\"; \"I am stupid (and bad)\" versus \"I missed my appointment for the third time and this is going to get me in trouble with my friends if I don\\'t change:\\' Lecture Point: Point out how judging is sometimes a shorthand way of comparing things to a standard; in this case, judging gives information. For example, saying that a tomato is \"bad\" may mean that it is not like a fresh tomato. Or judging may be a shorthand way of stating a preference. Saying that a room looks \"bad\" or a book was \"terrible\" is based on a personal preference in decorating or in reading material (or, sometimes on a personal or community standard for how rooms should look or how books should be written). The problem is that over time, people forget that judging is shorthand and begin to take it literally as a statement of fact. Discussion Point: Participants may believe that if people are saying something or someone is not \"bad;\\' then they must be saying it is \"good;\\' and vice versa. This is true only if people have the dichotomy \"goodbad\" in their minds in the first place and use that way of thinking to describe things. But thinking of things in terms of \"good\" and \"bad\" can be very harmful, and it is not necessary. Elicit from participants all the times others have applied judgments to them when they felt what they were doing, thinking, or feeling was neither good nor bad. Discussion Point: Judging is often a way of getting out of responsibility. Explain: \"If I don\\'t like what other people are doing and want them to stop it, I can say, \\'That is bad; and don\\'t have to own up to the fact that the real reason they should stop what they are doing is that I (and maybe everyone else too) don\\'t like it, don\\'t believe in it, or don\\'t want the consequences:\\' Elicit from participants times when others have tried to control their behavior by stating judgments as facts. Get examples of when they have tried that with someone else. Leaders: Give your own examples here. Note to Leaders: Borderline individuals will frequently believe that there really is a \"good\" and a \"bad:\\' You need to be dialectical here and search for a synthesis of different points of view. Do not expect clients to throw out judgments without a fight! Expect clients to bring up Hitler (or, more rarely, sexual abuse) as an example of \"bad\" with a capital B. Thus, the next lecture point is important: Judgments have their place. Letting go of judging is an idea that will grow over time. Don\\'t force it at the beginning. You can usually get more mileage out of focusing first on reducing self-judgments. (See Chapter 7 in the text for a more extensive discussion of these points.) Lecture Point: Some people are paid to compare things to standards or to predict consequences -that is, to judge. Teachers give grades, grocers put out \"good\" food or produce and discard \"bad\" food. The word \"good\" is also used to give children and adults feedback about their behavior so they will know what to keep doing and what to stop. So one thing to remember is \"Don\\'t judge judging:\\' It is essential at times. But most people overdo it, especially in judging themselves. Discussion Point: Discuss the difference between a judgment and a statement of fact. A statement of fact may seem to be a judgment because the fact is simultaneously being judged. For instance, \"I am fat\" may simply be a statement of fact. But if one adds (in thoughts, implication, or tone of voice) that the idea being fat is bad or unattractive, then a judgment is added. A favorite judgmental word of clients I work with is \"stupid;\\' as in \"I did a stupid thing;\\' \"I am stupid;\\' or \"What a stupid thing to say.\" Judgments often masquerade as statements of fact, so they can be hard to catch. Mental-health professionals are very good at this sometimes. lance had a therapist try to convince me that calling a patient narcissistic (for saying she felt more \"real\" when she was around me) was not a judgmental statement. Get other examples. Core Mindfulness Skills 69 B. One-mindfully. The goal here is to focus on one thing in the moment. Explain the process of doing one thing at a time with awareness. Emphasize focusing attention on only one activity or thing at a time, bringing the whole person to bear on a task or activity. Lecture Point: This is the opposite of how people usually like to operate. Explain: \"Most of us think that if we do several things at once we will accomplish more; this is not true. However, this does not mean that you cannot switch from one thing to another and back. The trick is to have your mind completely on what you are doing at the moment. This refers to both mental and physical activities.\" Discussion Point: Discuss an example of doing two things at once, such as sitting in skills training and thinking about the past or worrying about the future. Explain: \\'\\'A mindfulness perspective would suggest that if you are going to think about the past, you should devote your full attention to it. If you are going to worry about the future, devote your full attention to it. If you are going to attend class, devote your full attention to it.\" Get participants to come up with other examples (e.g., watching TV or reading while eating dinner). Lecture Point: The notion of \"worrying when you are worrying\" is very similar to a very effective therapy for chronic worriers, developed by Thomas Borkovec (Borkovec & Inz, 1990). The essence of the therapy is setting aside 30 minutes each day to worry. Explain: \"You go to the same place each day and try to spend the whole time worrying. During the rest of the day, you banish worries from your mind, reminding yourself that you will attend to that particular worry during your worry time. There is a similar technique for fighting insomnia: writing down all the things you need to remember for the next day before you go to sleep, so you won\\'t have to wake up to think about them.\" Lecture Point: Focusing on one thing in the moment does not mean that one cannot do complex tasks requiring many simultaneous activities. But it does mean that whatever one does, one should attend fully to it. Thus, the essence of the idea is acting with undivided attention. The opposites are mindlessness (i.e., automatic behaviors without awareness) and distracted behavior (i.e., doing one thing while thinking about or attending to another). C. Effectively. The goal here is to focus on being effective -to focus on doing what works, rather than what is \"right\" versus \"wrong\" or \"fair\" versus \"unfair.\" Generally, it is the opposite of \"cutting off your nose to spite your face.\" Lecture Point: Doing what works (or what is effective) requires knowing what one\\'s goal or objective is. For instance, a person may want to get a raise at work, but she may also think that her supervisor should know without being told that she deserves one, so she refuses to ask for it. In this case, the person is putting being right over achieving her goal. Lecture Point: Being effective requires knowing the actual situation and reacting to it, not to what one thinks should be the situation. For example, when driving on the freeway, people who drive more slowly are instructed by signs to drive in the right lane. People who tailgate slower drivers in the left lane (instead of just passing on the right) are acting as if all are prepared to follow the directions. All are not! Lecture Point: Effectiveness is \"playing by the rules.\" Playing by the rules is most important in situations where people are in a low-power position and what they want is important. A good example here is being an involuntary patient in a state hospital. Staff members make the rules about when a patient gets privileges. Right or wrong, they have the power, not the patients. Discussion Point: Get examples of participants\\' \"cutting off their noses\" to make a point. Leaders: share examples ofyour own here as well-the more outrageous or humorous, the better. Lecture Point: Effectiveness often means being \"political\" or savvy about people. It is taking people where they are (rather than where they \"should\" be) and going from there. Different people are like different cultures. What works in one culture may not work in another. Focusing on what\\'s \"right\" instead of what works is like trying to impose one\\'s own culture on another country when visiting. Discussion Point: Get examples of when participants have imposed their own culture or views on others. When have others imposed in this way on participants? Lecture Point: Effectiveness sometimes requires sacrificing principles to achieve a goal. In extreme situations (e.g., a concentration camp, where not playing by the rules would mean death), most people are willing to play by the rules even if they are not fair. In real life, this is sometimes very hard. It can be especially hard just when it is needed most, with people in authority positions. D. Discuss with participants which \"how\" skill (taking a nonjudgmental stance, focusing on one thing in the moment, being effective) is their strength and which is their weakness. The one they have most difficulty with is the one to practice the most. VI. Summarize states of mind, mindfulness \"what\" skills (observing, describing, participating), and mindfulness \"how\" skills (taking a nonjudgmental stance, focusing on one thing in the moment, being effective). 8 Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills Goals of the Module Interpersonal response patterns taught in DBT skills training are very similar to those taught in many assertiveness and interpersonal problem-solving classes. They include effective strategies for asking for what one needs, saying no, and coping with interpersonal conflict. \"Effectiveness\" here has to do with obtaining changes one wants, maintaining the relationship, and maintaining your self-respect. The particular behavioral patterns needed for social effectiveness are almost totally a function of a person\\'s goals in a particular situational context. Thus, the ability to analyze a situation and to determine goals is crucial for interpersonal effectiveness. The first section of the interpersonal effectiveness module addresses this problem. Borderline individuals frequently possess good interpersonal skills in a general sense. The problems arise in the application of these skills to specific situations. An individual may be able to describe effective behavioral sequences when discussing another person encountering a problematic situation, but may be completely incapable of generating or carrying out a similar behavioral sequence when analyzing her own situation. Usually, the problem is that belief patterns as well as uncontrollable emotional responses are inhibiting the application of the skills the person has. One of the primary behavioral mistakes that borderline individuals make is premature termination of relationships. Such termination probably results from difficulties in all of the skill areas. Problems in distress tolerance make it difficult to tolerate fears, anxieties, or frustrations that are typical in .conflictual situations. Problems in emotion regulation lead to inability to decrease chronic anger or frustration; inadequate interpersonal problem-solving skills make it difficult to turn potential relationship conflicts into positive encounters. Problems with attending to the moment in a nonjudgmental fashion (i.e., problems with mindfulness) make it difficult either to assess personal wishes and goals or to assess what is needed to improve the situation. Interpersonal effectiveness skills are difficult to develop in a vacuum; perhaps more than any other set of skills, they depend on simultaneous improvement across all skill areas. Borderline individuals frequently vacillate between avoidance of conflict and intense confrontation. Unfortunately, the choice of avoidance versus confrontation is usually based on an individual\\'s emotional state rather than on the needs of the current situation. In general, skills training challenges clients\\' negative expectancies regarding their environment, their relationships, and themselves. In this module, the goal is to teach clients how to apply specific interpersonal problem-solving, social, and assertiveness skills to modify aversive environments and to obtain their goals in interpersonal encounters. The module focuses on situations where the objective is to change something (e.g., requesting someone to do something) or to resist changes someone else is trying to make (e.g., saying no). Thus, it is most properly considered a course in assertion, where the goal is for persons to assert their own wishes, goals, and opinions in a manner that causes other people to take them seriously. The skills taught in this module are to maximize the chances that a person\\'s goals in a specific situation will be met, while at the same time not damaging (and, ideally, even enhancing) either interpersonal relationship or the person\\'s self-respect. The instructional content is divided into several segments. The first segment covers the basic interpersonal skills that are on the back of the diary cards and will be practiced for the rest of the treatment year. The se70 Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 71 cond segment deals with identifying factors that contribute to interpersonal effectiveness, as well as things that interfere with being effective. The third segment addresses factors to consider before asking someone for something, saying no, or expressing an opinion. The module then moves into specific skills: self-cheerleading skills, skills for getting what one wants, for keeping the relationship, and skills for keeping one\\'s self-respect. This module is one of the most difficult to get through in just 8 weeks, and I have often added a week or two the first time I offer the module. It is especially easy to spend too much time on the first half, leaving too little time for teaching the actual behavioral skills (objectives, relationship, and self-respect effectiveness skills). At least half of the module should be devoted to these three sets of skills. This is essential, because a most important part of all interpersonal skills training programs is the in-session practice of new behaviors. Integrating behavioral practice of new behaviors within sessions, however, can be one of the most difficult parts for new therapists and for those not trained in behavior therapy. Thus, it can be very easy to just let it slip by in this module. The beginning of the module includes a lot of more \"cognitive\" information and skills. These sections were put into the module because some of the topics actually do create difficulty for some borderline individuals, and I have conducted groups where members simply would not go on until we discussed one or more of these issues in depth. Thus, they are there if needed. The skills trainer may need to spend considerable time on some rather than others. Not all of these have to be covered in depth. Clients can read them between sessions, or they can be covered the next time the module is offered. If necessary for a particular client, the individual therapsist can also give more attention to these segments, particularly setting goals and priorities and identifying factors that contribute to or interfere with being effective. Content Outline L Orient clients to the skills to be learned in this module and the rationale for their importance. A. Review Interpersonal Effectiveness Handout I: Situations for Interpersonal Effectiveness. Note to Leaders: This handout is intended to orient clients to times when the skills taught in this module might be very useful. Go over it briefly and move to the next handout. Spend more time on it, if necessary, later. 1. Attending to relationships a. Explain: \"You need to attend to relationships to keep them in balance.\" b. Explain: \"You need to attend to relationships to keep them from blowing up or otherwise ending:\\' Lecture Point: Relationships that are not attended to can create enormous stress. This stress then increases emotional vulnerability, and life can simply go downhill. Unattended relationships often blow up, and can end even when people want them to continue. The longer relationships remain unattended to, the harder they are to repair. The ability to repair relationships is much more important than keeping them from \"tearing\" in the first place. 2. Balancing priorities vesus demands in life and relationships. a. Explain: \"Priorities are those things important to you, things that you want to do or get done.\" b. Explain: \"Demands are those things other people want you to do, things other people want done:\\' c. Explain: \"Most troubles with priorities and demands are due to your own priorities\\' conflicting with other people\\'s priorities. Thus, you need good interpersonal skills to maintain your own priorities and/or negotiate compromises.\" Lecture Point: Balancing priorities and demands is the basic task for structuring one\\'s life so that it is not too empty and not too full. Although this is difficult for everyone, it is especially difficult for the borderline individual, mainly because the ability to balance priorities and demands requires having requisite interpersonal capabilities and being able to use them in the appropriate situations. Lecture Point: Describe what is meant by balancing priorities and demands in life. Generally, for the person who is overwhelmed, overcommitted, and doing too much, it means first sorting out what is more and less important and then saying no to some of the less important demands and priorities. Discussion Point: Explain: \"Importance, of course, is always relative. It is especially difficult to figure out when a particular demand is unimportant to you but important to others in your social network. However, if you overcommit yourself in order to maintain approval from another person, in the end the relationship itself will be harmed:\\' Elicit feedback and discussion here to ferret out how much of a problem this is for participants. 72 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER Discussion Point: Just as a relationship may blow up if relationships are not attended to, at times an individual will blow up if priorities and demands in life are not attended to and balanced. Elicit examples. Discussion Point: Some participants will report that the issue is not too many demands and priorities, but too few. This is especially likely if an individual is single, living alone, and not working. In these cases, the task is to create structure and increase demands rather than to decrease them. Interpersonal skills are likely to be needed here also. Elicit discussion and feedback. Lecture Point: Draw a line on the blackboard. The left end of the line represents the beginning of a time period, and time moves along toward the right. Generally, if a person is overwhelmed, sooner or later she will either blow up or consider ending life. Often, this is when jobs are quit, suicide attempts are made, relationships are ended, and impulsive moves to other areas of the country occur. Discussion Point: Elicit examples from participants of when they have become so overwhelmed that they have \"blown up.\" Leaders: Share any examples from your own lives. Lecture Point: The level of demands that can be easily tolerated varies over time and from person to person. To a certain extent, this level depends on a person\\'s usual (or current) energy level, the amount of help and support forthcoming from the environment, and the person\\'s emotional state of being. Thus, people are different, and these differences need not be judged. Discussion Point: The borderline individual, like most persons, will often compare herself to other people and think that she should be able to do as much as these others. This comparison is often somewhat biased, and important factors are not taken into account. Also, borderline individuals, like others, often have a naive view of what other people can do, and therefore their beliefs about how much other people are doing are often overestimates. They set others on a pedestal and then feel inadequate when they cannot climb that same pedestal. What they fail to recognize is that the pedestal is often of their own creation; the other persons are in reality standing next to them. Elicit examples. 3. Balancing the wants-to-shoulds ratio in life and relationships. a. Explain: \"Wants include those things that you do because you want to do them, because they give you pleasure, or because you simply feel like doing them.\" b. Explain: \"Shoulds are those things you do because you ought to do them or you have to do them for some reason:\\' Lecture Point: The essential idea here is that people often resort to impulsive and dysfunctional behaviors when the wants in their lives are out of balance with the shoulds. A healthy lifestyle requires some overall balance between wants and shoulds. A life that is dominated by wants often runs into trouble because responsibilities are not met and commitments are not kept. However, a life dominated by shoulds can lead to depression, frustration, and anger. Thus, a balance in the long run is essential. These points need to be discussed in detail, since in my experience borderline clients often have trouble understanding the concept here. Lecture Point: Draw on the board a balancing scale to give a visual representation of what you are talking about. Although people can sometimes balance the wants-to-shoulds ratio without using any interpersonal skills, most of the time interpersonal skills iire necessary. At times it requires getting one\\'s opinions taken seriously, getting other people to do things, or saying no to unwanted requests. Discussion Point: Query participants about the current balance in their lives and what they think is needed to get their lives back in balance. It is essential here, besides getting the concept across, to relate balancing the wants-to-shoulds\\'ratio to using interpersonal skills. Elicit from participants examples of how other people are critical to their keeping the wants-to-shoulds ratio in balance. 4. Building mastery and self-respect. a. Explain: \"You build mastery when you do things that make you feel competent and effective:\\' b. Explain: \"You build self-respect when you stand up for yourself, express your own beliefs and opinions, follow your wise mind, and do what you believe is right and moraL\" Lecture Point: Mastery is the opposite of active passivity. (See Chapter 3 of the text for a description of active passivity.) Building mastery requires doing things that are difficult, that involve a challenge. Hopelessness is the enemy of mastery. Overcoming obstacles is one route to mastery. Most successful people in this world do not have fewer obstacles; they just get up after falling down more often than unsuccessful people do. Getting up after falling down is mastery. Falling down is irrelevant. The drive to mastery seems to be innate. Small children learning how to walk they keep falling down and getting up, falling down and getting up. Discussion Point: Discuss with participants what has happened to their ability to get up after falling down, their sense of mastery. Obviously, if a person never succeeds at a task, the sense of mastery won\\'t grow. ChilInterpersonal Effectiveness Skills 73 dren do not try to walk before they crawl. They do not try to do things they simply cannot do. Ifthey try, they soon cease and try something else they can do. Discussion Point: Explain: \"If you are raised in a punishing family, one that invalidates difficulties, then it is difficult to achieve a sense of mastery.\" Most borderline individuals have difficulty achieving a sense of mastery. They compare themselves to others and fall short. It is like a person with no legs comparing herself to runners with two legs; the comparison is faulty. However, in the case of legs, the handicap is obvious. In the case of emotional difficulties, the handicaps are less obvious. Get feedback. Lecture Point: Often the most difficult situations to master are interpersonal. If people are shy, they do not want to go places. They find it hard to ask for what they need, hard to say no, hard to express their opin~ ions firmly, and hard to attend to relationships. Practicing interpersonal skills builds mastery. Discussion Point: Elicit from participants times when they have done things that reduce their own sense of mastery. When have they enhanced their sense of mastery? How would they like to improve? B. Present two types of interpersonal skills to be taught: 1. Asking for things, making requests, initiating discussions. 2. Saying no, resisting pressure, maintaining a position or point of view. Discussion Point: Discuss with participants how they view their own interpersonal skills. Some individuals will be good at asking for things but terrible at saying no, whereas others can say no but cannot ask for anything. Still others are deficient across the board. Make it dear that sometimes individuals have appropriate skills in some situational contexts but not in others. For example, some people may be quite adequate at saying no to strangers but not to friends; others may be able to ask for help from friends but not from their bosses. Elicit from each person the types of skills she feels she has and the situations she is good in, as well as areas that need further work. Leaders: Feel free here to share with participants your own areas of strength and weakness. The major goal here is for clients to see the relevance of interpersonal skills training to their own lives by seeing areas in which they need improvement. Also, the discussion serves to normalize the notion of skill deficits by highlighting that everyone has areas in which she can improve her skills. In my experience, some borderline clients are exceptionally skilled in many interpersonal situations and may present as if they do not need interpersonal skills training. However, a doser discussion, especially of various situational contexts, will reveal that almost everyone can use some skills training. Therefore, even with a very skilled person, make every effort to identify areas where that person can use improvement. II. Review Interpersonal Effectiveness Handout 2: Goals of Interpersonal Effectiveness. Note to Leaders: Homework practice sheet for these skills is Interpersonal Effectiveness Homework Sheet 1: Goals and Priorities in Interpersonal Situations. A. Objectives effectiveness. Explain: \"Objectives effectiveness refers to attaining your objectives or goals in a situation. The idea with these skills is to get what you want in an interaction, for your wishes to be taken seriously. They include the following: 1. Standing up for your rights in such a way that they are taken seriously. 2. Requesting others to do something in such a way that they do it. 3. Refusing unwanted or unreasonable requests and making the refusal stick. 4. Resolving interpersonal conflict. S. Getting your opinion or point of view taken seriously;\\' Lecture Point: Borderline individuals often believe that all failures to get what they want from someone else are failures in skills. They have difficulty seeing that sometimes the environment is simply impervious to even the most skilled individuals. Thus, when they fail to get what they want using interpersonal skills, they may either fall back into hopelessness, try an aggressive response, or threaten (i.e., blackmail) other people if they don\\'t give them what they want. Thus, although increased interpersonal skills should increase the probability of getting objectives met, they are not a guarantee. Distress tolerance and reality acceptance are indispensable parts of interpersonal skills. Discussion Point: Get feedback. When have participants used really good skills but not gotten what they wanted? How did they feel afterwards? B. Relationship effectiveness: Explain: \"Relationship effectiveness is the art of maintaining or even improving an interpersonal relationship while you try to get what you want-that is, while you try to obtain your objectives. At its best, you will get what you want, and the person may like or respect you even more than before. These skills are as follows: 74 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER 1. Acting in a way that makes the other person actually want to give you what you are asking for or feel good about your sayIng no. 2. Balancing immediate goals with the good of the long-term relationship.\" lecture Point: Explain: \"If the main goal of the interaction is to get the other person to approve of you more, stop criticizing or rejecting you, stay with you, or the like, then enhancing the relationship is the objective and should be considered under objectives effectiveness. In that case, relationship effectiveness refers to choosing a way to go about improving or keeping the relationship that does not at the same time damage the relationship over the long run:\\' Discussion Point: Elicit from participants times they have risked a long term relationship for a short-term relationship gain. Examples may include attempting or threatening suicide to keep someone from leaving, or attacking another person for voicing criticism. lecture Point: Borderline individuals, of course, are highly concerned with maintaining relationships, approval, and liking. They are often willing to sacrifice personal goals for the sake of interpersonal relationships. Frequently, they operate under the myth that if they sacrifice their own needs and wants to other people, their relationships will go more smoothly, approval will be ever forthcoming, and no problems will arise. The key problem with this approach to life is that it doesn\\'t work; it is ineffective. Make this point especially clear. lecture Point: Draw a time line on the blackboard, as before. At the left end of the time line mark the beginning of a relationship. Then move the chalk toward the right as if time were marching on and discuss how a relationship goes if a person constantly subverts her own needs for the sake of a relationship. Although for some time a person can survive in such a relationship, at some point in time the frustrations that build up will have to be dealt with -usually at the point where frustrations are long-standing, the needs that have been unmet are large, and the sense of inequity is extreme. One of two things will happen. The frustrated individual will (1) blow up and thereby risk losing the relationship through the other person\\'s rejecting her and walking out, or (2) in frustration leave the relationship herself. Either way, the relationship comes to an end or is in serious jeopardy. Discussion Point: Engage the participants in a discussion of how this pattern has worked in their lives. Usually someone can give examples of how she has blown up. Indeed, for borderline individuals, parasuicide is often a method of getting someone to take your feelings and opinions seriously or of getting other people to change their behavior. It is a good example of the kind of behavior that shows up at the right-hand end of the continuum. Other dysfunctional behaviors can also be used as examples. It is important to elicit from participants how blowing up or walking out of relationships inadvertently jeopardizes their own goals. Clients may have great difficulty seeing this point. In my experience, borderline individuals often believe that these extreme behaviors not only are effective but are the only behaviors possible given the circumstances of their lives. It is essential at this point to develop some insight into how these strategies are self-defeating in the long run. Discussion Point: A key idea is that by not using interpersonal skills earlier in the sequence, the person has in fact jeopardized a relationship\\'s very existence instead of keeping it together. The idea here, of course, is to try to highlight how employing interpersonal skills will not only enhance relationships but improve a person\\'s chances of obtaining interpersonal and social approval rather than the opposite. A strategy that is sometimes useful at this point and at many other points is to ask participants to imagine another person\\'s engaging in extreme interpersonal behaviors with them, such as parasuicide or blowing up. How would it feel? From that perspective, individuals often find it easier to see the dysfunctional nature of the behaviors. The main goal here is to elicit clients\\' commitment to the value of learning and practicing interpersonal skills. Of course, such a commitment is likely to vanish in the actual situation where employing the skills is necessary; nonetheless, obtaining it is the first step in the process of shaping interpersonal skills. C. Self-respect effectiveness. Explain: \"Selfrespect effectiveness is maintaining or improving your good feelings about yourself, and respecting your own values and beliefs, while you try to attain your objectives. It includes the following: 1. Acting in ways that fit your sense of morality. 2. Acting in ways that make you feel competent.\" lecture Point: Giving in for the sake of approval, lying to please others, and the like all diminishes selfrespect over time. Acting helpless also diminishes selfrespect in the long term. Even if acting helpless is strategic-that is, deliberately calculated to get someone to do something-if overused the strategy will inevitably lead to reduced mastery. This point is very important. Acting helpless on purpose, when it works, can give a temporary sense of mastery. It is the overuse of this approach that causes problems. Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 75 Discussion Point: Elicit from participants times when they have done things that reduce their own sense of self-respect. When have they enhanced their sense of self-respect? Where do they need to improve their skills? III. Explain the relationship among the three types of effectiveness. A. All three types of effectiveness enter into and must be considered in every conflict or interpersonal problem situation. B. One or more types of effectiveness may be more or less important in a given situation. C. How effective a behavior is in a particular situation depends on a person\\'s priorities. IV. Give examples of situations and goals. A. Landlord keeps deposit unfairly (objective most important). 1. Objective: Getting deposit back. 2. Relationship: Keeping landlord\\'s good will and liking, or at least keeping good reference. 3. Self-respect: Not losing self-respect by getting too emotional, \"fighting dirty;\\' giving in. B. Best friend wants to come over and discuss a problem; person wants to go to bed (relationship most important). 1. Objective: Going to bed. 2. Relationship: Keeping good relationship with friend. 3. Self-respect: Balancing caring for friend with caring for self. C. Person wants a raise; her boss wants sex in return (self-respect most important). 1. Objective: Getting raise; staying out of bed with boss. 2. Relationship: Keeping boss\\'s respect and good will. 3. Self-respect: Not violating own moral code. Discussion Point: Have participants generate other situations and identify the objective(s) in the situation, the relationship issue, and the self-respect issue. Discuss priorities for each situation. Continue generating situations until it is clear that the participants have grasped the essential points. V. Review Interpersonal Effectiveness Handout 3: Factors Reducing Interpersonal Effectiveness. Note to Leaders: Homework practice sheet for these and following skills is Interpersonal Effectiveness Homework Sheet 2: Observing and Describing Interpersonal Situations. A. Skill deficits. Explain: \"When you have skill deficits, you actually don\\'t know what to say or how to act. You don\\'t know how you should behave to obtain your objectives:\\' Lecture Point: Describe the role of lack of ability to behave in a certain way; this is very different from motivational explanations of behavior. Emphasize that people learn social behaviors by observing someone else do them first, practicing them, and refining them until they can be used to obtain good results. People sometimes don\\'t have enough opportunities to observe; therefore, they don\\'t learn the behaviors. Or they don\\'t have the chance to practice the behaviors they do observe. Describe how a person can have skills in one set of situations but not in another, or in one mood but not in another, or in one frame of mind but not in another. Discussion Point: Elicit examples of having variable skills, depending on the situation or mood. B. Worry thoughts. Explain: \"Worry thoughts may get in the way of your ability to behave. You have the capability, but it is interfered with by your worry thoughts;\\' 1. Worrying about bad consequences (e.g., \"They won\\'t like me;\\' \"She will think I am stupid\"). 2. Worrying about whether one deserves to get what one wants (e.g., \"I am such a bad person I don\\'t deserve this\"). 3. Worrying about not being effective and calling oneself names (e.g., \"I won\\'t do it right;\\' \"I\\'ll probably fall apart;\\' \"I\\'m so stupid\"). C. Emotional reactions. Explain: \"Emotions may get in the way of our ability to behave. You have the capability, but it is interfered with by your emotions. You may get angry or anxious, or feel frustrated and guilty, because of how you think about situations or because you don\\'t know what to do. Emotions can keep you from acting or emotions can be so strong that emotional actions, words, and face and body expressions are automatic, overwhelming skills;\\' Lecture Point: Emotional reactions can be automatic reactions to situations, based on previous conditioning. Or they can be a result of believing the myths to be discussed below (or other myths). D. Indecision. Explain: \"You may not be able to decide what to do. You have the capability, but it is interfered with by your indecision;\\' 1. Ambivalence about priorities. 2. Inability to decide how to balance asking (saying no) with not asking (saying yes). Discussion Point: Discuss tendency to go to extremes of asking (saying no) versus not asking (giving 76 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER in). Also discuss tendency to go to extremes of belief: complete neediness (and asking in a clinging, begging, grasping or hysterical manner) versus complete selfsufficiency (and never asking, saying yes to everything), or, complete worthiness (and asking in an inappropriately demanding manner or refusing belligerently) versus complete unworthiness (and never asking or saying no). Elicit examples. E. Environment. Explain: \"Environmental factors may preclude effectiveness. At times even the most skilled individuals cannot be effective at getting what they want, keeping others liking them, or behaving in ways that they respect;\\' 1. When the environment is powerful, other people may simply refuse to give a person what she wants, or they may have the authority to make her do what they want her to do. Saying no or insisting on rights may have very negative consequences. 2. Sometimes there simply is no way for a person to get what she wants or to say no and keep the other person liking her. People may be threatened, jealous, or envious, or have any number of other reasons for not liking someone. 3. When a person is faced with a conflict, and achieving an objective is very important (e.g., food for her children, medical care when she is sick), she may have to act in ways that damage her pride or otherwise hurt her self-respect. Note to Leaders: Borderline individuals seem to have a very unrealistic view of the world and of what skilled people can do. In particular, they seem to believe that if they just ask correctly or are skilled enough, they can get whatever they want or need. The idea that people often don\\'t get what they want or need isn\\'t clear to them. Thus, they almost always blame themselves if they are ineffective at getting what they want. This self-blame then often generates anger and frustration. The belief that people can always get what they want and need precludes the necessity of developing distress tolerance skills. Without such skills, frustration often turns into anger. Be very careful on this point, especially during homework discussions. F. Interplay of factors. Explain: \"The less you know, the more you worry, the worse you feel, the more you can\\'t decide what to do, the more ineffective you are, the more you worry, and so on. Or the more yol,l experience nongiving and authoritarian environments, the more you worry, the less you practice, the less you know, the worse you feel, the more you can\\'t decide what to do, and so on.\" VI. Review Interpersonal Effectiveness Handout 4: Myths about Interpersonal Effectiveness. Lecture Point: All people have some worries about standing up for themselves, expressing opinions, saying no, and so on. Sometimes worries are based on myths about interpersonal behavior. One way to counteract these worries and myths is to try to argue against them logically. Another way is to experiment in the world and see whether they are really true. Counteracting worry thoughts and myths is an example of cognitive modification or cognitive therapy. It can sometimes be useful in getting people to do things they really want to do but are afraid to do. Challenges to myths can be used to challenge worries that crop up about trying interpersonal skills. Discussion Point: Use the devil\\'s advocate technique to discuss myths about interpersonal effectiveness. The task of participants is to develop challenges or counter arguments against the myths. These challenges can be used as cheerleading statements later to help clients get themselves to act effectively. Everyone write challenges down as participants think them up. Note to Leaders: In the devil\\'s advocate strategy, you present myths and then argue in favor of them, giving rather extreme positive statements, and thus getting participants to argue the case for the counterstatements. The discussion on each statement should be resolved by transcending the extremes to find a synthesis or balancing point of view. Not every myth has to be discussed in the session; the participants should be included in choosing which ones to go over in the session. (See Chapter 7 of the text for further discussion of this strategy.) A homework assignment might be to have clients complete the challenges not done during the session. Another assignment might be to observe themselves over the week and write down any other myths that they operate by. They should also think up challenges. Discussion Point: There are a number of ways to discuss these myths. One way is to read out each myth and have participants circle the myth if they agree with it. Generally, you first have to have a discussion about the difference between intellectual agreement and emotional agreement. You can also add \"wise mind\" agreement. Explain: \"Intellectual agreement is thinking that something is true; your rational mind tells you so. However, you may feel it is not true or know it is not. Emotional agreement is feeling that something is true, or reacting emotionally as if it is true. In these cases, you may believe and/or know that it is not. In wise mind, you know in your heart of hearts that something is or is not true.\" After the participants have marked myths as Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 77 true or not, read the myths again and ask who agrees with each myth, who circled it as true. Others who did not circle the myth should be encouraged to offer challenges. VII. Review Interpersonal Effectiveness Handout 5: Cheerleading Statements for Interpersonal Effectiveness. A. Cheerleading statements are statements that people make to themselves (i.e., self-state: ments) in order to give themselves permission to ask for what they need or want, to say no, and to act effectively. There are several types: 1. Statements that provide the courage to act effectively. 2. Statements that help in preparing for the situation-in getting ready to be effective, to focus on what works. 3. Statements that counteract myths about interpersonal behavior-unrealistic beliefs and assumptions that interfere with being effective. Lecture Point: Remind participants that some of the challenges they have generated to myths about interpersonal effectiveness can also be used as cheerleading statements. Encourage participants to select cheerleading statements that are well suited to them-that counteract their own myths and unrealistic beliefs. Note to Leaders: As with any new skill, it is essential that clients practice the new skill. For cheerleading statements, they can do this in two ways -imaginarily or by thinking out loud. B. Imaginal practice. 1. Instruct participants to close their eyes and imagine the situation you will be describing. Instruct them to imagine that they are in the situation, not observing the situation from the outside. 2. Describe an interpersonal conflict situation (see Handout 7 for list of practice situations, or use situations developed by clients). Give participants enough time to imagine themselves in the scene. (The first few times, check on how well participants are getting into the scenes, in order to gauge how to describe the situation.) 3. While participants are imagining themselves in the situation, instruct them to imagine themselves saying a cheerleading statement to themselves: \"Say it in imagination as if you mean it:\\' 4. Share with all participants cheerleading statements each person uses. C. Thinking-out-Ioud practice. 1. As above, describe a situation. You can have participants close their eyes and imagine being in the situation, as above, or not. 2. Go around the room rapidly and ask each participant to say a cheerleading statement out loud. (More than one person can use the same statement.) 3. You can use any of the procedures described below for role playing for thinkingout-loud practice. Discussion Point: Use the devil\\'s advocate strategy to go over some of the cheerleading statements, especially if new ones are generated. VIII. Review Interpersonal Effectiveness Handout 6: Options for Intensity of Asking or Saying No, and Factors to Consider in Deciding. Lecture Point: Being interpersonally effective requires thinking through whether it is appropriate to ask for something or to say no to a request. For example, a person who is sick might ask her healthy roommate to bring her a glass of orange juice. When the person asking is healthy and the roommate is sick, it would clearly be inappropriate to do so. The answer is not usually so black and white, however, contrary to what the average borderline individual thinks. Instead, there are levels of asking and levels of saying no. A. Options for intensity of asking and saying no. Explain: 6. Asking: Ask firmly, insist. Saying no: Refuse firmly, don\\'t give in. S. Asking: Ask firmly, resist no. Saying no: Refuse firmly, resist giving in. 4. Asking: Ask firmly, take no. Saying no: Refuse firmly, but reconsider. 3. Asking: Ask tentatively, take no. Saying no: Express unwillingness. 2. Asking: Hint openly, take no. Saying no: Express unwillingness, but say yes. 1. Asking: Hint indirectly, take no. Saying no: Express hesitancy, say yes. O. Asking: Don\\'t ask, don\\'t hint. Saying no: Do what other wants without being asked. B. Factors to consider in deciding on intensity of response. 1. Priorities: Objectives? If objectives are very important, the intensity of the response should to be higher. Relationship? Often, relationship issues are such that one is willing to trade an ob78 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER jective for keeping the other person happy. If so, the intensity of the response should be lower. Self-Respect? Self-respect issues may lead to a more or a less intense response, depending on how one feels about the outcome and the behavior. 2. Capability: If the other person has what one wants, the intensity of asking should be higher. If one does not have (and, therefore cannot give or do) what the other person wants, the intensity of saying no should be higher.1 3. Timelessness: If this is a good time to ask (other person is \"in the mood\" for listening and paying attention; he or she is likely to say yes to a request) the intensity of asking should be higher. If this is not a bad time for one to say no, the intensity of saying no should be higher. 4. Homework: If one knows all the facts necessary to support a request, and both the goal and the request are dear, intensity of asking should be higher. If the other person\\'s request is not clear, the intensity of saying no should be higher. 5. Authority: If one is responsible for directing the other person or telling him or her what to do, the intensity of asking should be higher. If the other person does not have authority or what the person is asking is not within his or her authority, the intensity of saying no should be higher. 6. Rights: If the other person is required by law or moral code to give what one wants, the intensity of asking should be higher. If one is not required to give what the other person wants (saying no would not violate the other person\\'s rights), the intensity of saying no should be higher. 7. Relationship: If what one wants is appropriate to the current relationship, the intensity of asking should be higher. If what the other person wants is not appropriate to the current relationship, the intensity of saying no should be higher. 8. Reciprocity: If one has done at least as much for the other person as one is requesting, and is willing to give if the other person says yes, the intensity of asking should be higher. If one does not owe the other person a favor, or the other person does not usually reciprocate, the intensity of saying no should be higher. 9. Long versus short term: Ifbeing submissive will result in peace now but create problems in the long run, the intensity of asking should be higher. If giving in and getting short-term peace now is not more important than the longterm welfare of the relationship, the intensity of saying no should be higher.2 10. Respect: If one usually does things for oneself and is careful to avoid acting helpless when this is not the case, the intensity of asking should be higher. If saying no will not result in bad feelings about oneself, and if wise mind says no, the intensity of saying no should be higher. C. Homework sheets can be used in deciding whether to ask for something or say no to a request. 1. On the left side, participants should count the number of \"Yes\" responses. If there are more \"Yes\" than \"No\" responses, then participants should make the request. The more \"Yes\" responses, the more intense the request should be. 2. On the right side, participants should count up the number of \"No\" responses. If there are more \"No\" than \"Yes\" responses, then participants should say no to a request made of them. The more \"No\" responses, the more intense saying no to the other person should be. IX. Prepare to present skills for interpersonal effectiveness. A. Note that skills will be learned for enhancing each type of effectiveness (objectives, relationship, self-respect). Note to Leaders: The skills are designed for effectiveness and do not necessarily follow rules clients may have learned in assertiveness classes. There are probably many other skills that would be just as effective. Clients should be encouraged to suggest other skills they have found effective. Note to Leaders: An essential component of interpersonal skills training is behavioral rehearsal, both Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 79 in sessions and between sessions as homework. With the exception of the first session, some time must be set aside each session for behavioral rehearsal. You must convey a sense of expectation and encouragement that everyone will participate in role playing. B. Stress necessity of behavioral rehearsal (roleplaying) in sessions to learn new skills. C. Stress necessity of homework practice In learning to use new skills where needed. Give out Interpersonal Effectiveness Handout 7: Suggestions for Interpersonal Effectiveness Practice. 1. Emphasize: \"If a situation arises between sessions where you can ask for something or say no, do it and try to use your skills:\\' 2. Explain: \"If nothing arises in daily life to give you the opportunity to practice, you need to dream up situations where you can practice. That is, do not just wait for a situation to arise where you can practice. Actively search out situations.\" 3. This list has lots of ideas for practice, or participants can make up their own situations. Discussion Point: Get feedback. Discuss objections to doing things on the list. Be flexible here. Borderline clients may be unable to do many of the things on the list. Remember your principles of shaping here. (See Chapter 10 of text.) x. Review Interpersonal Effectiveness Handout 8: Guidelines for Objectives Effectiveness: Getting What You Want. Note to Leaders: Homework practice sheet for these and following skills is Interpersonal Effectiveness Homework Sheet 3: Using Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills. A. Review definition of objective effectiveness. B. A way to remember the skills for objective effectiveness is to remember the term \"OEAR MAN\":3 ~escribe .xpress Assert Reinforce (stay) Mindfully Appear confident Negotiate 1. ~escribe the situation. Explain: \"When necessary, briefly describe the situation you are reacting to. Stick to the facts. No judgmental statements. Be objective.\" Give examples: \"I\\'ve been working here for 2 years and have not gotten a raise, even though my performance reviews have been very positive:\\' \"This is the third time you\\'ve asked this week for a ride home from work.\" 2. .xpress feelings or opinions about the situation clearly. Explain: \"Describe how you feel or what you believe about the situation. Don\\'t expect the other person to read your mind or know how you feel. For instance, give a brief rationale for a request or for saying no:\\' Give examples: \"I believe that I deserve a raise:\\' \"I\\'m getting home so late that it is really hard for me and my family. But I also really enjoy giving you rides home, and it is hard to say no:\\' Lecture Point: These two skills are not always necessary. For example, a person might simply ask a family member going to the grocery store to get some orange juice (without saying \"We\\'re out and I\\'d like some\"). In a hot, stuffy room, the person could ask someone else to open a window (without necessarily saying, \"the room is stuffy and I\\'m feeling hot\"). In saying no to a request, the person might simply say, \"No, I can\\'t do it:\\' Every participant, however, should learn and practice each of the skills. 3. ~ssert wishes. Explain: \\'\\'Ask for what you want. Say no clearly. Don\\'t expect people to know what you want them to do if you don\\'t tell them. Ask them for what you want. Don\\'t tell them what they should do. Don\\'t beat around the bush, never really asking or saying no:\\' Give examples: \"I would like a raise. Can you give it to me?\" \"But I have to say no tonight. I can\\'t give you a ride home so often.\" Lecture Point: These skills have to do mostly with being clear, concise, and assertive. The idea is to avoid beating around the bush or expecting others to be mind readers. The point to be conveyed is that a person just has to bite the bullet and ask or say no. 4. !einforce. Explain: \"Remember to reward people who respond positively to you when you ask for something, say no, or express an opinion. Sometimes it is effective to reinforce people before they respond to you positively by telling them the positive effects of getting what you want or need:\\' Give ex80 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER amples: \"I will ~e a lot happier and probabiy more productive if I get a salary that reflects my value to the company.\" \"Thanks for being so understanding, I really appreciate it:\\' Discussion Point: The basic idea here is that if other people do not gain from complying with a request, or taking no for an answer, at least some of the time they may stop responding in a positive way. The notion of behaviors being controlled by consequences instead of by concepts of \"good\" and \"bad\" or \"right\" and \"wrong\" can be particularly difficult for some clients to grasp. Discuss this idea with participants. Practice Exercise: Once a chunk of material is presented and discussed, move to rehearsal, where the material just learned can be practiced. Techniques are as follows: 1. Rapid rehearsal can be accomplished by going about the room and having each person briefly rehearse a particular skill immediately after it is presented or discussed. For example, participants can be asked to describe situations, express feelings or opinions about the situation, ask for something or refuse directly, or make a reinforcing comment. You can have everyone practice on the same situation (which either you or the participants can make up) or have each person use a situation from her own life. Practicing on the same situation is usually quicker if time is of the essence. Use this procedure at least once after presenting each individual skill. 2. Participants can role-play a situation, taking turns playing the person who is asking or saying no and the other person in the situation. Taking the part of the other person can be very important to give clients an idea of what it feels like when someone else uses behavioral skills on them. 3. One person can rehearse (role-play) a situation with you, the leader during the session. Usually, this is done when the participant is describing homework and it seems useful for her to try acting differently in the situation right away. It can also be used when a participant wants (or needs) help with particular types of situations. 4. If a client simply cannot role-play or refuses to do so, present the situation in story fashion: Ask, \"Then what would you say?\"; wait for a response; and then say, \"OK, then the other person says ... What would you say next?\" , 5. If the client refuses even this sort of dialogue, then ask her to role-play the situation in her head and imagine giving a skilled response. Do a fair amount of prompting to guide the client\\'s attention and focus. Note to Leaders: Role playing is often the most difficult procedure for therapists with little experience in behavior therapy; nonetheless, it is essential. (You might try the role-play procedures with a friend to get some practice.) Do not sacrifice rehearsal in order to present more material. Role playing can also be hard for clients at first, but with experience it gets easier. At the beginning, you sometimes have to pull or drag them through the practice. The most important thing with a reluctant role player is that you not fall out of role, even if she does. Just keep responding to her as if you are actually in the role-play situation. Usually, this will do the trick and the person will get back into the role play. s. (stay) Mindful. Explain: \"Keep your focus on your objectives in the situation. Maintain your position and don\\'t be distracted onto another topic. There are two useful techniques here.\" a. uBroken record:\\' Explain: \"Keep asking, saying no, or expressing your opinion over and over and over:\\' Lecture Point: This is perhaps one of the most important skills taught during this segment. It is also one of the skills clients can learn most readily, as it is easy to do and remember. The idea to get across is that a person doesn\\'t have to think up something different to say each time; she can keep saying exactly the same thing. The key here is to keep a \"mellow\" voice tone-\"kill them with sweetness;\\' so to speak. The strength is in the persistence of maintaining the position. Go around and practice this with each person. b. Ignore. Explain: \"If another person attacks, threatens, or tries to change the subject, ignore their threats, comments, or attempts to divert you. Just keep making your point.\" Discussion Point: The key idea to get across here is that if a person pays attention to attacks, responds to them in any way, or lets them divert her in the slightest, then she is giving the other person control of the interaction. Ifthe person wants to respond to the attacks, that is another issue and can be dealt with in another discussion, or after this one is finished. Once clients get the hang of this skill, it can be quite fun to use. Get feedback on this point from participants, paying special attention to their beliefs that they have to respond to every criticism or attack made by another. Note to Leaders: This skill, combined with the \"broken record;\\' makes for a very effective strategy in maintaining a refusal or putting pressure on someone to comply with a request. When the other person attacks, one should simply replay the \"broken record:\\' It is extremely difficult to keep attacking or criticizing a person who doesn\\'t respond or \"play the game:\\' But, it Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 81 is a lot harder than it looks. The only way for clients to get the hang of this skill is to practice. Be sure to practice both of these skills with all participants. Also, it can be a nice idea to have participants practice with each other, to see what having their own attacks and diversion strategies ignored or having another person keep repeating a request, opinion, or refusal feels like. The key to the \"broken record\" and ignoring attacks is to keep hostility out of one\\'s voice, but keep on track. 6. ~ppear confident. Explain: \"Use a confident voice tone and display a confident physical manner with appropriate eye contact. Such a manner conveys to both the other person and yourself that you are efficacious and deserve respect for what you want. No stammering, whispering, staring at the floor, retreating, saying you\\'re not sure, or the like:\\' Discussion Point: How confident to act in a given situation is a judgment call. A person needs to talk a fine line between appearing arrogant and appearing too apologetic. Elicit examples from participants. 7. Negotiate. Explain: \"Be willing to give to get. Offer and ask for alternative solutions to the problem. Reduce your request. Maintain your no, but offer to do something else or solve the problem another way. An alternative technique is to turn the tables.\" a. Turn the table. Explain: \"Turn the problem over to the other person. Ask for alternative solutions:\\' Give examples: \"What do you think we should do?\" \"I\\'m not able to say yes, and you really seem to want me to. What can we do here?\" \"How can we solve this problem?\" Discussion Point: Negotiating or turning the tables is useful when ordinary requesting or refusing is getting nowhere. There are many variations on the negotiating strategy. Get participants to discuss any time they have used it. e. Use objectives effectiveness in really difficult situations. 1. Explain: \"Sometimes other people have really good skills themselves, and keep refusing your legitimate requests or pestering you to do something you don\\'t want to do.\" 2. In such cases, the same \"DEAR MAN\" skills should be used, except that the focus should be changed to the current interaction with the person (the person\\'s behavior right now). In particular, the \"DEAR\" skills change as follows: a. Describe the current interaction. Explain: \"Ifthe \\'broken record\\' and ignoring don\\'t work, make a statement about what is happening between you and the person now, but without imputing motives:\\' Give examples: \"You keep asking me over and over, even though I have already said no;\\' not \"You just don\\'t want to hear what I am saying.\" b. Express feelings or opinions about the Interaction. Explain: \"For instance, in the middle of an interaction that is not going well, you can express your feelings of discomfort in the situation.\" Give examples: \"I\\'m not sure you understand what I am asking;\\' or \"I\\'m starting to feel angry about this.\" c. Assert wishes in the situation. Explain: \"For example, when a person is refusing a request, suggest that you put the conversation off until another time. Give the other person a chance to think about it. When another person is pestering you, ask him or her to stop ie\\' d. Reinforce. Explain: \"When saying no to someone who keeps asking, or when someone won\\'t take your opinion seriously, suggest ending the conversation since you aren\\'t going to change your mind anyway:\\' XI. Review Interpersonal Effectiveness Hand out 9: Guidelines for Relationship Effectiveness: Keeping the Relationship. A. Review definition of relationship effectiveness. B. A way to remember the skills for relationship effectiveness is to remember the word \"GIVE\" (DEAR MAN, GIVE): (be) ~entle (act) !nterested Validate (use an) !asy manner 1. (be) Gentle. Explain: \"Be courteous and temperate in your approach. People tend to respond to gentleness more than they do to harshness. In particular, avoid attacks, threats, and judgments.\" a. No attacks. Explain: \"This is really pretty clear. People won\\'t like you if you 82 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER threaten them, attack them, or express much anger directly:\\' b. No threats. Explain: \"Don\\'t make \\'manipulative\\' statements or hidden threats. Don\\'t say, \\'I\\'ll kill myself if you ... \\'Tolerate a no to requests. Stay in the discussion even if it gets painful. Exit gracefully.\" Note to Leaders: This point may be very sensitive with some dients. I usually present it as if it is not sensitive and ask whether anyone has a problem with making threats. The idea is to normalize the interpersonal behavior (making threats \"manipulating\") that they have been accused of by others. Acknowledge how hard it is to stop such behavior. Discussion Point: Usually the question will come up of how a person can communicate suicidal ideation in such a way that it is not a threat and that others do not take it as a threat. This is a good question. Generally, the best way is for the person to couple the communication with a statement that she wants to work on her urges to harm or kill herself. Explain: \"The idea is to make it sound as if you are taking responsibility for not harming or killing yourself rather than making it the other person\\'s responsibility. When others feel like that (even if you did not cause it), they usually say that you are threatening or manipulating them. In general, if you say that you feel like you are going to kill or harm yourself, but at the same time say that you want help or that you know you can control yourself, it is not a threat. Saying that you are going to commit suicide or harm yourself if someone else doesn\\'t come through for you, do what you want, cure you, or make things better -or even implying this-is a threat:\\' c. No judging. Explain: \"No name calling, \\'shoulds; or implied put downs in voice or manner. No guilt trips:\\' Discussion Point: This point is woven throughout all of the skills. But, it is so important that it is emphasized as a separate skill. Elicit from participants times when they have felt judged by others. Try a role-play to see what it feels like to be judged. 2. (act) !nterested. Explain: \"Be interested in the other person. Listen to the other person\\'s point of view, opinion, reasons for saying no, or reasons for making a request of you. Don\\'t interrupt, try to talk it over, or the like. Be sensitive to the other person\\'s desire to have the discussion at a later time, if that\\'s what the person wants. Be patient:\\' Lecture Point: Explain: \"People feel better about you if you are interested in them and if you give them time and space to respond to you.\" 3. Validate. Explain: \"Validate or acknowledge the other person\\'s feelings, wants, difficulties, and opinions about the situation. Be nonjudgmental out loud.\" Lecture Point: Explain: \"Validating often requires you to read the other person\\'s mind. Figure out what problems the person might be having with your request or your saying no. Then acknowledge those feelings or problems.\" Give examples: \"I know that you are very busy, but :\\' \"1 can see that this is really important to you, :\\' \"1 know this will take you out of your way a bit, :\\' Note to Leaders: Clients can practice validating others even if a conflict situation does not arise -that is, they don\\'t make a request or say no. Validating is simply a good, all-purpose skill. More than any other skill, this one has the potential to affect the quality of relationships. 4. (use an) Easy manner. Explain: \"Try to be lighthearted. Use a little humor. Smile. Ease the other person along. Wheedle. Soothe. This is the difference between the \\'soft sell\\' and the \\'hard sell: Be politicaL\" Lecture Point: People don\\'t like to be bullied, pushed, or made to feel guilty. Although people often say that borderline individuals are manipulators, a really good manipulator makes other people like giving in. The premise in DBT is that borderline individuals need to learn to be better at manipulating -inducing others to do what they want them to do. C. Use relationship effectiveness in important relationships. 1. Explain: \"Sometimes you have to sacrifice the short-term relationship for a few hours or days for the sake of the long-term relationship. You have to stand up for yourself and allow the other person to be angry, sad, or disappointed:\\' 2. In important relationships, the \"DEAR MAN\" skills are also relationship effectiveness skills. Explain: \"When you use \\'DEAR MAN\\' appropriately, you take the burden off the other person of always having to take care of you.\" XI. Review Interpersonal Effectiveness Handout 10: Guidelines for Self-Respect Effectiveness: Keeping Your Respect for Yourself. A. Review definition of self-respect effectiveness. B. A way to remember the skills for self-respect Interpersonal Effectiveness Skills 83 effectiveness is to remember the word \"FAST\" (DEAR MAN, GIVE FAST): (be) fair (no) ~pologies Stick to values (be) !i\"uthful 1. (be) fair: Explain: \"Be fair to yourself and the other person in your attempts to solve the problem.\" Lecture Point: Explain: \"It is hard to like yourself over the long haul if you consistently take advantage of other people. You may get what you want, but at the risk of your ability to respect yourself.\" 2. (no) ~pologies. Explain: \"When apologies are warranted, of course they are appropriate. But don\\'t engage in overapologetic behavior. No apologizing for being alive, for making a request at all. No apologies for having an opinion, for disagreeing. Apologies imply that you are wrongthat you are the one making a mistake. This can reduce your sense of self-efficacy over time.\" Lecture Point: Like telling a lie, making apologies can at times enhance relationship effectiveness. The need to enhance the relationship must be balanced with the need to enhance self-respect. Excessive apologies, however, often get on other people\\'s nerves and usually reduce both relationship and self-respect effectiveness. 3. ~tick to values. Explain: \"Don\\'t sell out your values or integrity just to get your objective or keep a person liking you. Be dear on what, in your opinion, is the moral or valued way of thinking and acting, and hold on to your position.\" Discussion Point: When a situation is dire, or lives are at stake, people might choose to give up their values. The problem is that borderline individuals often have black-and-white views on this issue: Either they are willing to sell out everything to get approval and liking (to give up their entire \"self;\\' it seems), or they interpret everything as an issue of values and view flexibility of any sort as giving up their integrity. Elicit examples. 4. (be) !ruthful. Explain: \"Don\\'t lie, act helpless when you are not, or exaggerate. A pattern of dishonesty over time erodes your self-respect. Even though one instance may not hurt, dishonesty as your usual mode of operating and getting what you want cannot fail to be harmful over the long run. Acting helpless is the opposite of building mastery:\\' Discussion Point: At times, being honest may actually reduce relationship effectiveness. The \"little white lie\" was invented for just this reason. Any attempt to convince dients that honesty is always the best policy will probably fail. Discuss this point with participants. The crucial idea is that if one is going to lie, it should be done mindfully rather than habitually. C. Self-res,peet effectiveness and objectives effectiveness. Lecture Point: Explain: \"It is important to remember that no one can take away your self-respect unless you give it up. Using \\'DEAR MAN\\' can improve selfrespect by increasing a sense of mastery. So it is good to practice these skills. But you can also enhance selfrespect by giving up things you want for the welfare of the other person. Using \\'DEAR MAN\\' effectively sometimes leads to a loss of self-respect for the other person. Balancing what you want and what the other person wants and needs might be the best path to self-respect.\" O. Self-respect effectiveness and relationship effectiveness. Lecture Point: Explain: \"Most people\\'s sense of self-respect is somewhat dependent on the quality of their relationships. Thus, using \\'GIVE\\' skills well will probably enhance your sense of self-respect. However, ifyou only use \\'GIVE\\' skills with a person who is abusive with you or doesn\\'t care about you -always validating the other person, being interested, using an easy manner, and never threatening no matter what the other person does-your self-respect is likely to erode over time. Using \\'GIVE\\' skills when they are needed, and putting them away when harshness and boldness are necessary, might be the best path to self-respect.\" XII. Summarize interpersonal goals; factors reducing effectiveness; cheerleading statements; and effectiveness skills for obtaining objectives, keeping relationships and keeping self-respect. Notes 1. The importance of the wants-to-shoulds ratio was first discussed by Marlatt and Gordon (1985). 2. The wording here, while a bit awkward, is so that a \"No\" response to a question will mean \"Say, no.\" 3. The idea for the four DEAR skills (describe, express, assert, reinforce) was taken from the \"DESC scripts\" (describe, express, specify, consequence) of Bower and Bower (1980). Their excellent self-help book is very compatible with DBT and can be used by both skills trainers and dients. 9 Emotion Regulation Skills Borderline and suicidal individuals are emotionally intense and labile-frequently angry, intensely frustrated, depressed, and anxious. From a DBT perspective, difficulties in regulating painful emotions are central to the behavioral difficulties of the borderline individual. From the individual\\'s perspective, painful feelings are most often the \"problem to be solved:\\' Suicidal behaviors and other dysfunctional behaviors, including substance abuse, are often behavioral solutions to intolerably painful emotions. Their emotional intensity and lability suggest that borderline clients might benefit from help in learning to regulate their emotions. In my experience, most borderline individuals try to regulate emotions by instructing themselves not to feel whatever it is that they feel. This oversimplistic style is a direct result of the emotionally invalidating environment, which mandates that people should smile when they are unhappy, be nice and not rock the boat when they are angry, and confess and feel forgiven when they are feeling guilty. Emotion regulation skills can be extremely difficult to teach, because a borderline individual has often been overdosed with remarks that if she would just \"change her attitude\" she could change her feelings. Many borderline individuals come from environments where everyone else exhibits almost perfect cognitive control of their emotions. Moreover, these very same others have exhibited both intolerance and strong disapproval of the individuals\\' inability to exhibit similar control. Often, borderline clients will resist any attempt to control their emotions, because such control would imply that other people are right and they are wrong for feeling the way they do. Thus, emotion regulation skills can be taught only in a context of emotional self-validation. 84 Like interpersonal effectiveness and distress tolerance, emotion regulation requires application of mindfulness skills-in this case, the nonjudgmental observation and description of one\\'s current emotional responses. The theoretical idea is that much of the borderline individual\\'s emotional distress is a result of secondary responses (e.g., intense shame, anxiety, or rage) to primary emotions. Often the primary emotions are adaptive and appropriate to the context. The reduction of this secondary distress requires exposure to the primary emotion in a nonjudgmental atmosphere. In this context, mindfulness to one\\'s own emotional responses can be thought of as an exposure technique. (See Chapter 11 of the text for a fuller description of exposurebased procedures.) There are a number of specific DBT emotion regulation skills. Specific Emotion Regulation Skills Identifying and Labeling Emotions The first step in regulating emotions is learning to identify and label current emotions. Emotions, however, are complex behavioral responses. Their identification often requires the ability not only to observe one\\'s own responses but also to describe accurately the context in which the emotion occurs. Thus, learning to identify an emotional response is aided enormously if one can observe and describe (1) the event prompting the emotion; (2) the interpretations of the event that prompt the emotion; (3) the phenomenological experience, including the physical sensation, of the emotion; (4) the behaviors expressing the emotion; and (5) the aftereffects of the emotion on other types of functioning. Emotion Regulation Skills 85 Identifying Obstacles to Changing Emotions Emotional behavior is functional to the individual. Changing emotional behaviors can be extremely difficult when they are followed by reinforcing consequences; thus, identifying the functions and reinforcers for particular emotional behaviors can be useful. Generally, emotions function to communicate to others and to motivate one\\'s own behavior. Emotional behaviors can also have two other important functions. The first, related to the communication function, is to influence and control other people\\'s behaviors; the second is to validate one\\'s own perceptions and interpretations of events. Although the latter function is not fully logical (e.g., if one person hates another, this does not necessarily mean that the other is worthy of being hated), it is nonetheless important for borderline individuals. Identifying these functions of emotions, especially negative emotions, is an important first step toward change. Reducing Vulnerability to \"Emotion Mind\" All people are more prone to emotional reactivity when they are under physical or environmental stress. Accordingly, the behaviors targeted here include balancing nutrition and eating, getting sufficient but not too much sleep (including treating insomnia if needed), getting adequate exercise, treating physical illness, staying off nonprescribed mood-altering drugs, and increasing mastery by engaging in activities that build a sense of self-efficacy and competence. The focus on mastery is very similar to activity scheduling in cognitive therapy for depression (Beck, Rush, Shaw, & Emery, 1979). Although these targets seem straightforward, making headway on them can be exhausting for both borderline clients and their therapists. With respect to insomnia, many of our borderline clients fight a never-ending battle in which pharmacotherapy often seems of little help. Poverty can interfere with both balanced nutrition and medical care. Work on any of these targets requires an active stance by the clients and persistence until positive effects begin to accumulate. The typical problem-solving passivity of many borderline individuals can create substantial interference here. Increasing Positive Emotional Events DBT assumes that most people, including borderline individuals, feel badly for good reasons. Although all people\\'s perceptions tend to become distorted when they are highly emotional, that does not mean that the emotions themselves are the results of distorted perceptions. Thus, an important way to control emotions is to control the events that set off emotions. Increasing the number of pleasurable events in one\\'s life is one approach to increasing positive emotions. In the short term, this involves increasing daily positive experiences. In the long term, it means making life changes so that pleasant events will occur more often. In addition to increasing positive events, it is also useful to work on being mindful of pleasurable experiences when they occur, as well as unmindful of worries that the positive experience will end. Increasing Mindfulness to Current Emotions Mindfulness to current emotions means experiencing emotions without judging them or trying to inhibit them, block them, or distract from them. The basic idea here is that exposure to painful or distressing emotions, without association to negative consequences, will extinguish their ability to stimulate secondary negative emotions. The natural consequences of a person\\'s judging negative emotions as \"bad\" are feelings of guilt, anger, and/or anxiety whenever she feels distress. The addition of these secondary feelings to an already negative situation simply makes the distress more intense and tolerance more difficult. Frequently, the person could tolerate a distressing situation or painful affect if only she could refrain from feeling guilty or anxious about feeling painful emotions in the first place. Taking Opposite Action Behavioral-expressive responses are important parts of all emotions. Thus, one strategy to change or regulate an emotion is to change its behavioral-expressive component by acting in a way that opposes or is inconsistent with the emotion. This should include both overt actions (e.g., doing something nice for a person one is angry at, approaching what one is afraid of) and postural and facial expressiveness. With respect to the latter, however, clients must learn that the idea is not to block expression of an emotion; rather, it is to express a different emotion. There is a very big difference between a constricted facial expression that blocks the expression of anger and a relaxed facial expression that expresses liking. Applying Distress Tolerance Techniques Tolerating negative emotions without impulsive actions that make matters worse is, of course, one way to modulate the intensity and duration of negative emotions. Any or all of the distress tolerance techniques covered in the next chapter may be helpful; therefore, I do not discuss them here. 86 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER The instructional content of this module is divided into the following segments. The first segment deals with understanding the nature of emotions; a model of emotions provided and discussed. The second segment has to do with learning how to identify and label emotions in everyday life. The third segment focuses on identifying the functions of emotions and their relationship to difficulties in changing emotions. The fourth segment has to do with reducing vulnerability to negative emotions (emotion mind). The fifth segment deals with how to increase positive emotional events, and the sixth and final segment has to do with how to decrease emotional suffering through mindfulness to the current emotion and taking opposite action. Content Outline I. Orient clients to the skills to be learned in this module and the rationale for their importance. Review Emotion Regulation Handout I: Goals of Emotion Regulation Training. A. Understanding one\\'s own emotions. 1. Learning to identify emotions as they are experienced: applying the mindfulness skills of observing and describing to emotions. 2. Learning to identify what gets in the way of reducing intense negative emotions by analyzing the functions of.emotions-the purposes they serve or needs they fulfill. B. Reducing emotional vulnerability. 1. Learning to decrease negative vulnerability-to prevent negative emotional states by reducing the of likelihood of being overly emotionally sensitive (emotion mind) and increasing emotional hardiness. 2. Learning to increase positive emotions and thus to reduce negative emotional sensitivity. C. Decreasing emotional suffering. 1. Letting go of painful emotions by being mindful to them, instead of fighting them or walling them off. 2. At times, modulating or changing a negative or painful emotion by acting in a manner opposite to it. II. Describe two kinds of emotional experiences. A. Some emotional experiences are primarily reactions to events in one\\'s environment (being angry at someone for criticizing, feeling happy that a loved one is coming to visit, being surprised that it is a nice day when rain was predicted, etc.). B. Other emotional experiences are primarily reactions to one\\'s own thoughts, actions, and feelings (guilt about feeling angry, anger at being unable to remember something, shame at not doing well on a task, pride at winning a race, etc.). C. This module will focus on both kinds of emotions. III. Describe the role of emotions in people\\'s lives. A. Emotions can be useful or destructive, or (more rarely) neutral. Discussion Point: Elicit from participants when emotions have been useful and when they have been destructive. Have participants discuss the emotions that give them the most trouble. Which ones would they most like to work on? Note to Leaders: It is very important to get across the idea that the goal of emotion regulation is not to get rid of emotions or make people into zombies. Borderline individuals will always be emotional. The idea is to reduce their suffering. Determine which clients are afraid of losing all their emotions and which are trying to get rid of all their emotions. B. Appraisals of emotions-that is, what people say to themselves about emotions-can influence our ease and comfort with them. Lecture Point: A central problem for borderline individuals is that they react to most negative emotions with secondary emotions of guilt, shame, or anger. These secondary emotions cause all sorts of problems. In particular, they confuse the picture and make identification and description of the primary emotions very difficult. The primary emotions, are overshadowed by the secondary emotions; thus, problem solving in regard to the primary emotions is difficult. This topic will come up again and again in this module. Discussion Point: Elicit examples from participants of occasions when they have a secondary emotional reaction to a primary emotion (e.g., getting depressed about being depressed, getting angry or feeling ashamed for getting angry). Ask which usually causes them more trouble and pain -the primary or the secondary emotion? IV. Review Emotion Regulation Handout 2: Myths about Emotions. Discussion Point: Use the devil\\'s advocate technique to discuss myths about emotions. The task of parEmotion Regulation Skills 87 ticipants is to develop challenges or counterarguments to the myths. These challenges can be used as cheerleading statements later to help the clients feel better. Have everyone write challenges down as participants think them up. Note to Leaders: See the discussion of Interpersonal Effectiveness Handout 4 in Chapter 8 of this manual (point VI in the content outline) for suggestions on using the devil\\'s advocate strategy to discuss myths. V. Present a theory of emotions. A. There are probably about eight or so primary or basic emotions (e.g., anger, sorrow, joy, surprise, fear, disgust, guilt/shame, interest). People are born with the potential, or biological readiness, for these. All others are learned, and are usually some combination of the basic emotions. B. Emotions are particular types of patterned reactions to events. They are complex and involve lots of components. C. Emotions come and go. They are like waves in the sea. Most emotions only last from seconds to minutes. D. Emotions are also self-perpetuating. Once an emotion starts, it keeps restarting itself. When an emotion seems to stay around, it is called a \"mood.\" E. Review Emotion Regulation Handout 3: Model for Describing Emotions. Note to Leaders: Homework practice sheet for these skills is Emotion Regulation Homework Sheet 1: Observing and Describing Emotions. (The section on function is described later in the module, but is included in this homework sheet to cut down on the number of sheets.) 1. Prompting event (inside or outside). The events that prompt emotions can be outside in the environment, or they can be inside. A person\\'s own thoughts, behaviors, and physical reactions can prompt emotions. One emotion can prompt another emotion. Some events can prompt emotions automatically; that is, a person can have an automatic reaction without any thoughts about the event. Fear when looking down from a high place is an example. Joy when looking at a beautiful sunset may be another example. Discussion Point: Elicit other examples. 2. Interpretation of event. Most events do not automatically prompt emotions. Instead, the emotion is prompted by a person\\'s interpretation of the event, or how the person appraises or thinks about the event. a. Example: Many fears are learned. People would not be afraid of guns if they did not believe that guns can kill. b. Example: Mary doesn\\'t like Susan or Jenny. Susan gets very angry at Mary for not liking her; Jenny gets very afraid. Why? Susan is thinking how much she has done for Mary; Mary should appreciate it and like her. Jenny thinks that if Mary doesn\\'t like her after all she has done for Mary, then maybe no one will like her. Practice Exercise: Have participants think up events and interpretations that set off different emotions. One way to do this is to get one person to give a situation or event, have another give an interpretation, and have a third give the emotion. Then, for the same event, have a fourth person give another interpretation and a fifth figure out the emotion that would go with that interpretation. This can be repeated many times with the same event. Go through a number of events. The important point to make is that often people are responding to their own interpretations of an event, not to the event itself. 3. Emotion: Emotions are very complex, but generally consist of several parts or different reactions happening at the same time. a. Emotions involve body changes, such as tensing or relaxing of muscles, changes in blood vessels, fluctuations in heart rate, skin temperature, etc. i. The most important changes are in facial muscles. Researchers now think that changes in the facial muscles playa very important role in actually causing emotions. 11. Most people learn to inhibit or hide their body changes, at least some of the time. But even though the changes are not be obvious, very sensitive instruments could probably pick them up. Discussion Point: Borderline individuals have learned better than most to hide their emotions by controlling the facial muscles that express emotions. This is a natural result of social learning in an emotionally invalidating environment. The hiding is usually automatic; that is, the individuals do not intend it or are not aware of it. This is a major reason why others often do 88 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER not know that these persons are as upset as they arethey don\\'t look it! Discuss how participants have learned to conceal their emotions in this way. Discussion Point: It is also possible that a borderline individual is born with an emotional system that is less obviously expressive than the systems of others. It may be that this initial tendency to underexpress emotions (e.g., through facial expressions) sets up a situation where others in the environment do not get the feedback they need to monitor their interactions with the borderline individual appropriately. Thus, the environment becomes less responsive to emotional responses of the individual, setting up an invalidating pattern. Offer this hypothesis very tentatively and see how participants react to it. b. Emotions involve brain changes. Neurochemical changes in the brain are important parts of emotions. Some parts of the brain (e.g., the limbic system) appear to be very important in regulating emotions. The brain changes can then have effects on the rest of the body. i. Some researchers believe that one reason borderline individuals have trouble regulating emotions is that they have a problem in their brain chemistry. ii. Psychoactive drugs work to control emotions by changing brain chemistry. The problem is, however, that once the brain knows the drugs are there, it often changes the chemistry again to compensate for this. c. Emotions involve sensing. When people have emotional feelings, they are actually sensing their body and brain changes. This is usually what is meant by an \"emotional experience:\\' Discussion Point: Explain: \"Thus, when people tell you to quit feeling something, this is kind of silly. It would be like telling you to quit feeling the rain come down on your head. The only way to \\'quit feeling\\' it is to divert your attention. Although that is sometimes easy to do, it is sometimes next to impossible. Telling a person with her foot in a burning fire to divert her attention would be kind of silly.\" Discuss this idea. Practice Exercise: Lead participants in a series of exercises where they try to quit feeling/sensing something (e.g., their arms on their chair arms), and then try diverting their attention. Explain: \"Sometimes the problem in emotions is that you cannot sense your body and body changes. To regulate emotions, you have to be pretty good at sensing your body. If you have been practicing shutting off all sensations for years, this can be difficult.\" Discussion Point: Get feedback on which clients have difficulty sensing their bodies and which have difficulty pin-pointing exactly what part of their bodies they are sensing. Discuss the notion that for some people, emotions are like a fog; they can\\'t see (sense) what exactly an emotion is. d. Emotions involve action urges. An important function of emotions is to prompt behavior (e.g., fight in anger, flight in fear). Although the action itself is usually not considered part of the emotion, the urge to act is. Discussion Point: Discuss action urges of several emotions. Elicit feedback from participants. e. In the case of very complex emotions, interpretations, beliefs, and assumptions may be part of the emotions. For example, despair is sadness combined with a belief that things are terrible and will not get better. 4. Expression. One of the most important functions of emotions is to communicate. If it is to do that, an emotion has to be expressed. a. The expression of primary or basic emotions is \"hard-wired\" into human beings. Research shows that in all cultures, the same facial expressions are linked to the same basic emotions. Many actions that express emotions are also hard-wired. b. People can learn to inhibit emotional expressions or to express them differently. For complex emotions that are learned, the expressions are learned. c. Different facial expressions and behaviors may express different emotions, depending on one\\'s overall culture, regional culture (e.g., the South vs. the Northwest in the United States), our family culture, school culture, and individual differences. Discussion Point: Discuss the fact that each family, town, state, etc., is a miniculture. Expressiveness that is OK in one miniculture, may not be OK in another. Get examples from participants\\' own experience. Discussion Point: Discuss the point that what an expression means can vary from time to time and person to person. Thus, reading emotions is easy in some senses but very difficult. People often misread one anEmotion Regulation Skills 89 other\\'s emotions. The same behavior can express many different emotions. The same emotion can be expressed by many different behaviors. Discuss when participants have been misread and have misread others. 5. Types of expression. a. Body language (e.g., postural and facial changes). b. Words (e.g., \"I love you:\\' \"I hate you:\\' \"I am sad:\\' \"I\\'m sorry\"). c. Actions (kissing, hitting, running toward someone, withdrawing passively, avoiding, doing cartwheels). 6. Emotion name. Every culture gives names to emotions. There is some evidence that people who can give an emotion a name are better able to control the emotion. How to name emotions is learned. Obviously, it is easier to name simple emotions than complex ones. VI. Present the concept of recognizing, describing, and naming emotions. A. Describing an emotion involves describing: 1. Prompting events and situation. 2. Interpretation of the event or situation (i.e., thoughts, assumptions, beliefs). 3. Body responses that are sensed (or can be sensed if one pays attention). 4. Body language, (i.e., face and posture). 5. Verbal communication of the emotion. 6. Action urges and actions taken. Lecture Point: By learning to observe your emotions, y~)U learn to be separate from (not identified as) your emotions and also at one with your emotions. In order to control, you must be separate from your emotions so that you can think and use coping strategies. But you also need to be one with your emotions, in the sense that you identify them as part of yourself and not something outside you. Give the example of a horse and rider: To the extent that the rider is \"one\" with her horse she can control the horse. If she is separate, fighting the horse, the horse will fight back and she cannot control it smoothly. On the other hand, if the rider is mindless, so to speak, and has no identity separate from the horse, she will just cling to the horse for dear life and the horse will assume all direction. B. Emotions also have aftereffects. Lecture Point: Intense emotions have powerful aftereffects on memory, thoughts, and even the ability to think, physical function and behavior. In a sense, we can say \"emotions love themselves:\\' They organize the person in such a way as to continue (or keep refiring) the very same emotion. B. Review Emotion Regulation Handout 4: Ways to Describe Emotions. Lecture Point: Explain: \"These are typical emotion words and typical features or characteristics of emotions. Much of the handout was made up by ordinary people in response to questions about their emotional experiences.\" Note to Leaders: The primary intent of this handout is to give clients ideas when they have trouble describing characteristics of their own emotions. It does not have to be gone over in detail. You might just flip through it, explaining what it is, and have clients read it between sessions. Some will find this very helpful, others not so helpful. It is essential not to convey that the features listed on the handout are necessary to each emotion. These are typical features, but because of culture and individual learning, features may differ from person to person. Discussion Point: Have participants give their own ideas about characteristics of emotions. Practice Exercise: Have clients engage in roleplay practice. 1. Have each person think of an emotional situation to role-play. 2. Give instructions in how to do role-play. Have two clients role-play the situation, or you can role-play it with one client. Have everyone observe the situation, and describe nonverbal expressive behavior of the roleplay participants. Guide clients to pay special attention to faces. 3. Have the role players describe how they felt and what they were expressing. Note to Leaders: See Chapter 8 of this manual (point X in the content outline) for further suggestions regarding the conduct of role-playing practice. VII. Describe factors that interfere with observing and describing emotions. A. Secondary emotions (emotional reactions to emotions). As noted earlier, when a secondary emotion comes on the scene, it can cover up or confuse the primary emotional reaction. B. Ambivalence (more than one emotional reaction to the same event). Note to Leaders: These points are usually best made during homework sharing. Participants should fill out as many homework sheets (Emotion Regulation Homework Sheet 1) as there are prompting events. Thus, if a person has a secondary emotional reaction prompt90 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER ed by the original emotion or set of emotions, she should fill out a second homework sheet. You need to be particularly vigilant about this during homework sharing; it can be very difficult to sort out. VIII. Review Emotion Regulation Handout 5: What Good Are Emotions? Note to Leaders: Homework practice sheet for these skills is Emotion Regulation Homework Sheet 2: Emotion Diary. A. Why do people have emotions? Many animals have emotional behaviors. Emotional behavior is very immediate and efficient. In fact, it is probably necessary for survival. B. If there were no function or need for emotions, they would be easy to change. But because they have a purpose (serve a need, etc.), they can be very hard to change. C. Emotions communicate to (and influence) others. 1. Facial expressions are a hard-wired part of emotions. In primitive societies and among animals, facial expressions communicate like words. Even in modern societies, facial expressions communicate faster than words. a. Having both verbal and nonverbal forms of emotional expression means having two ways of communication for important situations. b. Some emotional expressions have an automatic effect on others. That is, the effect is not learned. 1. For example, an infant reacts spontaneously to an adult\\'s smile or look of fright. This automatic reaction serves infants well until they learn to use words. Even after they can use words, facial expressions are still very helpful. 11. When body expressions of emotion (facial, posture, voice tone) and what a person says don\\'t go together, other people almost always will trust the nonverbal expressions over the verbal ones. Discussion Point: This is a very important point. A major premise of DBT is that one of the problems of borderline individuals is that their nonverbal emotional expressions are often not accurate indicators of what the individual is experiencing, and thus they are often misread. Get examples from participants of being misread or of misreading others because of mismatched nonverbal communication. 2. When it is important to communicate to others, or send them a message, it can be very hard to change emotions. a. Example: IfJane wants Kathy to know that Kathy is in the wrong, then Jane may want to remain angry until Kathy gets the message. IfJane stops being angry, Kathy may not take her seriously or may not realize that she is indeed in the wrong. b. Example: If Julie wants Emily to realize how dangerous the situation they are in is, Julie may not want to stop being afraid. Otherwise, Emily may think the situation is safe. c. If Maria wants Terry to know what she likes, she may want to stay joyful. 3. The communication of emotions influences others, whether a person intends it or not. a. Examples: Warmth and friendliness of an acquaintance may result in a later favor; disappointment expressed by a supervisor may result in improved work by an employee; anger may result in one person\\'s giving another her rightful due instead of withholding it. b. Example: Feeling worthless, hopeless, and agonizingly sad may influence a therapist or another person to take away the pain. (So the hope goes.) c. Example: Expressed anger may stop others\\' behavior. Discussion Point: Get participants to give examples of their emotions\\' influencing others and of their being influenced by others\\' emotions, and discuss. Also, elicit examples of times when this strategy boomeranged -that is, when participants\\' expression of emotion got them something they didn\\'t want. Discussion Point: Elicit communication value of guilt/shame, surprise, love, and sadness, as well as of the emotions mentioned in examples above. D. Emotions organize and prepare for action. 1. Emotions prepare for and motivate behavior. The action urge connected to specific emotions is hard-wired. 2. This saves time in getting people to act in Emotion Regulation Skills 91 important situations. They don\\'t have to think everything through. a. Example: In communities where there is no sadness at losing people, why would anyone ever go out and look for lost people or try to save people who are dying? Communities would die off if there were no sadness. b. Example: Students often do not want to reduce test anxiety because they are afraid that if they do, so they will quit working so hard and then fail their tests. c. Example: People are afraid to reduce guilt because they are afraid that without guilt they will start doing harmful things. Discussion Point: Elicit and discuss other examples, especially examples having to do with anger. E. For humans, emotions also function to communicate to ourselves. Emotions can be \"self-validating:\\' 1. People often use their emotional reactions to other people and to events as information about the situation. Emotions can be signals or alarms that something is going on. a. This is what is meant by the saying \"Pay attention to (or listen to) your gut.\" b. Likewise, when we say a person has a \"good feel for a situation;\\' we are referring to emotions as signals. c. Sometimes signals picked up from the situation at a nonconscious (or automatic) level are processed. This processing sets off an emotional reaction, but the person cannot identify what about the situation set off the emotion. Through trial and error-that is, experience-people learn when to trust these emotional responses as information about the situation, and when to believe that they are providing information about the persons responding rather than about the situation. Discussion Point: Get examples from participants of when their \"feel\" for a situation proved to be correct. Discuss how people often ignore their own \"sense\" or \"feel\" for a situation simply because they can\\'t put into words good reasons for that \"sense;\\' or because other people disagree. Note to Leaders: Note that using one\\'s emotions this way is the same as using the countertransference to give you a clue about your clients. That is, therapists are often trained to use emotions in this way. 2. When this use of emotions is carried to an extreme, emotions are treated as facts: \"If I feel incompetent, I am:\\' \"If I get depressed when left alone, I shouldn\\'t be left alone.\" \"If I feel right about something, it is right.\" People use their emotions to tell themselves that what they believe is correct. Note to Leaders: This issue is both crucial and very sensitive for borderline individuals. A primary function of negative emotions for them is self-validation. This is understandable once you remember the invalidating environments most have experienced. The way it works is as follows: When a person\\'s feelings are minimized or invalidated, then it is difficult for her to get her concerns and needs taken seriously. Also, too much may be asked or expected of her. One way to counteract this is for her to increase the intensity of her emotions. Sooner or later, she will probably be attended to. If then at a later point the person does not get very emotional under the same circumstances, then it proves other people right: Her emotions weren\\'t valid in the first place. After enough of these instances, the person\\'s integrity is on the line with her emotions. If the situation is not as bad as she says it is, then she is shameful for having caused so much trouble to others. Ergo, the function of negative emotions gradually evolves to that of self-validation. Getting these points across to borderline individuals is fraught with difficulty because the very idea is invalidating. Care, patience, and skill are needed here. Discussion Point: Get participants to give examples and discuss. Draw from them instances where emotions are self-validating and where changing negative emotions is invalidating. Give personal examples if you can think of any. IX. Prepare to present methods for reducing emotional vulnerability A useful way to remember these skills is the phrase \"PLEASE MASTER:\\' Treat !hysica! illness Balance ~ating Avoid Mood-Altering drugs Balance !Ieep Get ~xercise Build MASTERy X. Review Emotion Regulation Handout 6: Reducing Vulnerability to Negative Emotions: How to Stay out of Emotion Mind. 92 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER Note to Leaders: Homework practice sheet for these skills is Emotion Regulation Homework Sheet 3: Steps for Reducing Painful Emotions. Some skills are also included on the back of the DBT diary card. A. Treat ~hysica! illness. Explain: \"Being sick lowers your resistance to negative emotions.\" Discussion Point: Discuss any illnesses participants have had. What interferes with treating illness? Embarrassment about the problem (as in the case of sexually transmitted diseases), lack of assertion skills, and lack of money are common obstacles. B. Balance !ating. Explain: \"Try to eat the amounts and kinds of foods that help you feel good -not too much or too little:\\' Discussion Point: Discuss the research on restrained eaters that shows the negative effects of eating too little. The idea is also for people to stay away from foods that make them feel bad. Stress avoiding these. Ask participants for foods that make them feel good (e.g., chocolate), calm (e.g., milk), or energized (e.g., sugar, meat); stress the role of such foods, in moderation. C. Avoid mood-Altering drugs. Explain: \\'~lcohol and drugs, like certain foods, can lower resistance to negative emotions:\\' Discussion Point: Use this as an opportunity to discuss alcohol and drug problems participants may be having. Discuss effects of drugs on emotions, as well as difficulties in staying off mood-altering drugs. D. Balance ~Ieep: Explain: \"Try to get the amount of sleep that helps you feel goodnot too much or too little:\\' Discussion Point: Elicit participants\\' troubles with sleep. This is usually an important problem for borderline individuals. Too little sleep, especially, can make them particularly vulnerable to negative emotions; it may be part of a depression syndrome. What has helped? What has made things worse? E. Get !xercise. Explain: \\'~erobic exercise, done consistently, is an antidepressant. In addition, a regular exercise schedule can build mastery.\" Discussion Point: Ask what forms of exercise participants are engaging in. An important problem here is that consistent exercise requires self-management skills, and most borderline individuals have few such skills. This discussion is an opportunity to discuss principles of self-management, especially reinforcement principles. F. Build MASTERy. Explain: \"Do things that make you feel competent, self-confident, in control, and capable of mastering things.\" Lecture Point: Doing things to build mastery is an important component of cognitive therapy for depression, which is a very effective therapy. The idea is to build a sense of confidence and competence. Doing so makes a person more resistant to depression and other negative emotions. Building mastery usually requires doing something that is at least a little bit hard or challenging. Discussion Point: Elicit activities that give participants a sense of mastery. These will probably differ for each person. XI. Review Emotion Regulation Handout 7: Steps for Increasing Positive Emotions. A. Building positive experiences. Explain: \"Increase the number of events that prompt positive emotions, such as love, joy, pride, selfconfidence, and calm:\\' Note to Leaders: As noted earlier, a basic point in DBT is that most people, including borderline individuals, who feel painful emotions do so for good reasons. The assumption here is that it is usually (but not always) the events in life that cause unhappiness, not faulty appraisals of events. This is pretty much the opposite of what is assumed by many therapists. A reconciliation between the two points of view is possible, however. Once a person gets emotional, she distorts; thus, vigilance for distorting is useful, and reappraisal can be helpful. However, focusing on cognitive distortions as the source of difficulty simply further invalidates the behavior, emotions, and thinking processes of the borderline individual. Instead, the goal is to validate the individual\\'s responses. 1. Short term. Explain: \"Do pleasant things that are possible now. Increase daily positive experiences:\\' Note to Leaders: Give out Emotion Regulation Handout 8: Adult Pleasant Events Schedule. Encourage clients to do as many as possible of those things on the schedule that make them feel happy or joyful. Discussion Point: Elicit little things that participants find pleasant. Be creative. Get some ideas from the \"Crisis Survival Strategies\" handout (Distress Tolerance Handout 1; see Chapter 10 of this manual). Emotion Regulation Skills 93 2. Long term. Explain: \"Make changes in your life so that positive events will occur more often:\\' a. Explain: \"Make a list of positive events you want in your life. These are your goals. Work toward these goals:\\' Lecture Point: No one is very happy if she doesn\\'t have many positive events in her lives. This is a basic point ofDBT. It is hard to be happy without a life worth living. Building a life worth living-one that is satisfying and one that brings happiness-is like saving pennies in a piggy bank. A person has to accumulate positives. b. Explain: \"Attend to relationships. Repair old relationships. Make new relationships.\" Lecture Point: Most people need good relationships to be happy. Many people are not very happy unless they are in one or more close relationships. Explain: \"The secret here is not to put all your eggs in one basket. Don\\'t let your entire happiness depend on one person or one group (for example, a romantic relationship, your family).\" c. Explain: \"Avoid avoiding. Avoid giving up:\\' Lecture Point: No one can build up a positive life if she avoids problem solving or doing things that are necessary. B. Mindfulness of positive experience. Explain: \"Be mindful of positive events that occur. Do the following: 1. Focus your attention on positive events that happen. 2. Refocus on positive parts of events when your mind wanders to the negative.\" C. Unmindfulness of worries. Explain: \"Do not destroy positive experiences. Be unmindful of the following: 1. Thinking about when it will end. 2. Thinking about whether you deserve it. 3. Thinking about how much is expected of you now:\\' Lecture Point: These are extremely important skills. Many borderline individuals can experience positive emotions, but these evaporate in a second; they do not last. Thus, clients have to work really hard at learning how to get positive emotions to linger. Often they are afraid that if they feel good, bad things will happen-that is, they have a phobia of positive emotions. Or a negative thought intrudes quickly. These points should be stressed. XII. Review Emotion Regulation Handout 9: Letting Go of Emotional Suffering: Mindfulness of Your Current Emotion. A. Mindfulness of emotions means observing and describing them just as they are. 1. Explain: \"This strategy is useful because it allows you to get distance from your emotions. Distance is crucial for figuring things out and for problem solving in regard to emotions:\\' 2. Observing emotions is a form of exposure. It works on the same principle that exposure does in treating fear and panic. Explain: \"By exposing yourself to emotions, but not necessarily acting on them, you will find that they are not so catastrophic. You will stop being so afraid of them. Once you are less afraid, all the fear, panic, anger, and so forth that result from your emotions\\' being as they are will dissipate:\\' B. The best way to get rid of negative and painful emotions is to let them go. But learning to let go is extremely difficult. C. Letting go of emotions is not the same as pushing them away. Fighting pain usually makes it worse. Lecture Point: Painful emotions are part of the human condition. Once again, DBT assumes that there are valid reasons for negative emotions. Short of making tremendous life changes, people probably cannot get rid of a lot of them; even then, negative emotions will always be a part of life. Ergo, the trick is to find a new way of relating to negative emotions so that they do not induce so much suffering. The way is through acceptance. Accepting painful emotions eliminates the suffering, leaving only the pain. At times, acceptance even reduces the pain. Fighting emotions insures that they stay. This is simply a restatement of the principles of mindfulness (see Chapter 7 of this manual) and of distress tolerance (see Chapter 10), but these points are extremely important to get across. Discussion Point: Discuss the role of acceptance and emotional suffering. Usually, you can expect borderline individuals to get this point. Get feedback. D. Explain: \"The basic steps in letting go are as follows: 1. Observe your emotion. Acknowledge its presence. Step back. Get unstuck from the emotion. 2. Try to experience your emotion as a wave, 94 SKilLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER coming and going. (It can be very useful here to concentrate on just physical parts of the emotion, or just quality of experience, or the like.) Try not to block or suppress the emotion. Open yourself to the flow of the emotion. Do not try to get rid of the emotion. Don\\'t push it away. Don\\'t judge or reject it. Do not try to keep the emotion around. Don\\'t cling to it. Don\\'t rehearse it. Don\\'t hold on to it. Don\\'t amplify it. 3. Note that you are not your emotion. Do not necessarily act on the emotion. 4. Trying to build a wall to keep emotions out always has the effect of keeping emotions in. Instead, practice loving your your emotions. Be willing to have them.\" Lecture Point: This last point is of course a difficult one. \"Loving\" in this context means \"acceptance.\" Fighting emotions does not make them go away. Accepting emotions allows a person to do something about them. Refer to the example of the horse and rider (see item VI, above). The idea of loving and accepting emotions also does not mean increasing or augmenting them. Story Point: The following story is adapted from one I was told by a Zen teacher, who read it in a book by another spiritual teacher, Anthony de Mello, S.J., (1983). The story is a very helpful one in teaching the concept of loving one\\'s emotions. A man bought a new house and decided that he was going to have a very beautiful lawn. He worked on it every week, doing everything the gardening books told him to do. His biggest problem was that the lawn always seemed to have dandelions growing where he didn\\'t want them. The first time he found dandelions, he pulled them out. But, alas, they grew back. He went to his local gardening store and bought weed killer. This worked for some time, but after summer rains, alas, he found dandelions again. He worked and pulled and killed dandelions all summer. The next summer he thought he would have no dandelions at all, since none grew over the winter. But, then, all of a sudden, he had dandelions all over again. This time he decided the problem was with the type of grass. So he spent a fortune and had all new sod put down. This worked for some time and he was very happy. Just as he started to relax, a dandelion came up. A friend told him it was due to the dandelions in the lawns of his neighbors. So he went on a campaign to get all his neighbors to kill all their dandelions. By the third year, he was exasperated. He still had dandelions. So, after consulting every local expert and garden book, he decided to write the U.S. Department of Agriculture for advice. Surely the government could help. After waiting several months, he finally got a letter back. He was so excited. Help at last! He tore open the letter and read the following: \"Dear Sir: We have considered your problem and have consulted all of our experts. After careful consideration, we think we can give you very good advice. Sir, our advice is that you learn to love those dandelions.\" This story can be told as often as necessary. The idea is to get to the point where clients say to you, \"I know, this is a dandelion.\" Discussion Point: Have participants share times when radical acceptance of emotions has reduced suffering. Share your own experiences. Discuss the idea of \"loving\" one\\'s emotions. Practice Exercise: Have participants fill out Homework Sheet 1 or 2 (\"Observing and Describing Emotions\" or \"Emotion Diary\"). Discuss the emotion they have selected and what events set it off. E. Explain: \"Respect your emotion. Don\\'t assume that it is irrational or based on faulty perceptions or distortions.\" XIII. Review Emotion Regulation Handout 9: Changing Emotions by .Acting Opposite to the Current Emotion. Lecture Point: Some psychotherapy researchers believe that when treatments for emotional disorders work, they do so because they reverse the expressive and action components of emotional responses. For example, a number of researchers have observed that effective therapies for depression all share a common thread: They activate behavior. Similarly, effective therapies for anxiety disorders all share a common thread of nonreinforced exposure to feared situations. Effective treatments for anger tend to stress learning to identify the cues to frustration and/or anger and leaving the situation. It is essential to get across to clients the rationale for this technique and to elicit their cooperation. See the section on exposure-based procedures in Chapter 11 of the text for a more extensive discussion. A. Fear. Explain: \"When you are afraid, approach what you are afraid of rather than avoid it. Do what you are afraid to do rather than avoid it.\" B. Guilt or shame. Explain: \"When you are guilty or ashamed, keep doing what you feel guilty or ashamed of (assuming that the guilt is unjustified). Again, approach, don\\'t avoid. When you are guilty or ashamed and the emoEmotion Regulation Skills 95 tion is justified by your behavior, repair the situation, apologize, and then go on.\" C. Sadness or depression. Explain: \"When you are depressed, get active. Do things that make you feel competent and self-confident rather than acting passive. Again, approach, don\\'t avoid.\" D. Anger. Explain: \"When you are angry, gently avoid the person you are angry with rather than attacking. (This means also avoiding thinking about him or her rather than ruminating.) Distract yourself: Do something nice rather than mean. Try to be sympathetic rather than blaming.\" Lecture Point: It is very important to note that the idea here is to act contrary to an emotion, not to mask or hide emotions. Explain: \"You have to throw your entire self into acting opposite to the emotion. But you do not have to suppress your feelings. Your behavior or actions communicate to your brain, and the effect is a slow but steady change in your emotions. This procedure works when your emotions are not realistic for the situation. Thus, if the problem is fear, you should only enter fearful situations if there is no serious danger. If the problem is guilt or shame, don\\'t repeat actions that in your wise mind you believe are immoral:\\' Practice Exercise: Have participants pay attention to sensations in their faces. Guide them in noting any areas of tension. Now instruct each person to imagine a situation during the past week when she felt angry or sad or worried. While she is thinking about it, she should again notice sensations in the face. Instruct participants to raise a hand slightly to signal to you when they have the situation in mind. Now, as they continue to imagine, instruct them to try to mask the feelings so that no one else in the room (if anyone was looking) would know the feeling or even realize that feelings exist. Have them notice the sensations in the face; have them notice what happens to the emotions. Next, instruct each person to relax her facial muscles, smoothing them out as much as she can. Have participants notice how emotions change (or don\\'t change); have them notice how different the face feels. It is common for clients to report that when they relax their faces, they feel much more vulnerable. Explain: \"This means you are allowing feelings to come and go. You are not holding them in or pushing them out.\" Practice Exercise: The very best practice exercises are those in which you can get participants to act differently from how they feel right in the group. Over and over during modules, look for opportunities to instruct members to do their best to not act in accord with their emotions of the moment. For example, when clients want to leave out of anger, anxiety, hurt feelings, or panic, instruct them to stay, orienting them to how staying is practicing acting opposite to their emotions. Periodically, as, \"What do you do when you are afraid?\" Coach them until they can always chime out, \"Do what you are afraid of!\" \"What do you do when you\\'re depressed?\" \"Get active!\" \"What do you do when you feel guilty?\" \"Figure out if it is justified and either repair it or do it over and over and over (if not)!\" And so on. Drill members until they have this cold. XIV. Summarize emotion regulation goals, emotion myths, observing and describing emotions, function or purpose of emotions, reducing vulnerability to negative emotions, increasing vulnerability to positive emotions, mindfulness to the current emotion, and acting opposite to the current emotion. 10 Distress Tolerance Skills Goals of the Module Most approaches to mental health treatment focus on changing distressing events and circumstances. They have paid little attention to accepting, finding meaning for, and tolerating distress. Although the distinction is not as clear-cut as I am making it seem, this task has generally been tackled by religious and spiritual communities and leaders. DBT emphasizes learning to bear pain skillfully. The ability to tolerate and accept distress is an essential mental health goal for at least two reasons. First, pain and distress are part of life; they cannot be entirely avoided or removed. The inability to accept this immutable fact itself leads to increased pain and suffering. Second, distress tolerance, at least over the short run, is part and parcel of any attempt to change oneself; otherwise, impulsive actions will interfere with efforts to establish desired changes. Distress tolerance skills constitute a natural progression from mindfulness skills. They have to do with the ability to accept, in a nonevaluative and nonjudgmental fashion, both oneself and the current situation. Essentially, distress tolerance is the ability to perceive one\\'s environment without putting demands on it to be different, to experience your current emotional state without attempting to change it, and to observe your own thoughts and action patterns without attempting to stop or control them. Although the stance advocated here is a nonjudgmental one, this should not be understood to mean that it is one of approval. It is especially important that this distinction be made clear to clients: Acceptance of reality is not equivalent to approval of reality. The distress tolerance behaviors targeted in DBT skills training are concerned with tolerating and surviving crises and with accepting life as it is in the moment. Four sets of crisis survival strategies are taught: distract96 ing, self-soothing, improving the moment, and thinking of pros and cons. Acceptance skills include radical acceptance (i.e., complete acceptance from deep within), turning the mind toward acceptance (i.e., choosing to accept reality as it is), and willingness versus willfulness. Gerald May (1982) describes willingness as follows: Willingness implies a surrendering of one\\'s selfseparateness, an entering into, an immersion in the deepest processes of life itself. It is a realization that one already is a part of some ultimate cosmic process and it is a commitment to participation in that process. In contrast, willfulness is the setting of oneself apart from the fundamental essence of life in an attempt to master, direct, control, or otherwise manipulate existence. More simply, willingness is saying yes to the mystery of being alive in each moment. Willfulness is saying no, or perhaps more commonly, \"yes, but ... \" (p. 6) Although borderline clients and their therapists alike readily accept crisis survival skills as important, the DBT focus on acceptance and willingness is often viewed as inherently flawed. This viewpoint is based on the notion that acceptance and willingness imply approvaL This is not what May means; indeed, he points out that willingness demands opposition to destructive forces, but goes on to note that it seems almost inevitable that this opposition often turns into willfulness: But willingness and willfulness do not apply to specific things or situations. They reflect instead the underlying attitude one has toward the wonder of life itself. Willingness notices this wonder and bows in some kind of reverence to it. Willfulness forgets it, ignores it, or at its worst, actively tries to destroy it. Thus willingness can sometimes seem very active and assertive, even aggressive. And willfulness can appear in the guise of passivity. Political revolution is a good example. (p. 6) Distress Tolerance Skills 97 Content Outline I. Orient clients to skills to be learned in this module and the rationale for their importance. A. Skills for tolerating and surviving crises. B. Skills for accepting life as it is in the moment. Lecture Point: The skills in the module are ones that help people get through life when they can\\'t make changes for the better in their situation and when, for any number of reasons, they can\\'t sort out their feelings well enough to make changes in how they feeL Basically, the skills are ways of surviving and doing well in terrible situations without resorting to behaviors that will make the situations worse. Discussion Point: Everyone has to tolerate some amount of pain and distress in life. Life simply is not pain-free. Always trying to avoid pain leads to more problems than it solves. Get examples from participants of this point. Lecture Point: Present the research literature on avoidance. Posttraumatic stress disorder is primarily a result of trying to avoid all contact with cues that cause discomfort. Pathological grieving-that is, grieving that never ends-is a result of the same avoidance. Avoiding all cues that are associated with pain insures that the pain will continue. The more people attempt to avoid and shut emotional (as well as physical) pain off, the more it comes back to haunt them. Trying to suppress emotional pain or avoid contact with pain-related cues leads to ruminating about the painful events; paradoxically, trying to get rid of painful thoughts creates painful thoughts. For example, one of the most successful and effective programs for helping people with chronic physical pain is based almost entirely on the practice of mindfulness and is described in the book Full Catastrophe Living by Jon Kabat-Zinn (1990). (See also the section on exposure-based treatments in Chapter 11 of the text.) Experiencing, tolerating, and accepting emotional pain are the ways to reducing pain. Lecture Point: But there are times for people to distract themselves from pain also. Painful situations cannot always be immediately processed. It is often not an appropriate time for working on painful emotions or situations. At work, at school, or at meetings, people may feel emotional pain, be upset, or feel alienated. However, they may simply have to tolerate the feelings. This module is not about working things out or changing things; it is about accepting and tolerating things. Discussion Point: Elicit examples of times when pain is intense but it is not an appropriate time to work on changing the source of the pain or figuring out and changing the painful emotions. Discuss the relationship of this module to the fact that not much time in skills training is spent processing feelings. II. Review Distress Tolerance Handout I: Crisis Survival Strategies. Note to Leaders: Homework practice sheet for these skills is Distress Tolerance Homework Sheet 1: Crisis Survival Strategies. A. Give overview of skills. 1. The skills to be learned here are concrete skills in how to tolerate and survive a crisis situation when the crisis cannot be changed right away. 2. The basic idea is to learn how to get through bad situations without making them worse. Discussion Point: Elicit from participants crisis situations they need to tolerate. Discussion Point: Surviving crisis situations is part and parcel of being effective, \"doing what works\" (a core mindfulness skill). However, at times people are more interested in proving to others how bad a situation is than in surviving the situation. The problem with proving how bad things are is that it hardly ever works. That is, although it may result in short-term gains (e.g., being put in the hospital or getting a lover to return), it usually fails in the long tun. Elicit situations where this has been the case with clients. Leaders: Ifyou can give personal examples here, so much the better. 3. There are four categories of crisis survival strategies: distracting, self-soothing, improving the moment, and focusing on pros and cons. Each is a series of methods for shortcircuiting or coping with overwhelming negative emotions and intolerable situations. 4. These strategies are intended for getting through crisis situations and overwhelming emotions. They are not presented as a cure all for one\\'s problems or life. Beneficial effects may only be temporary (but achieving them is not a small feat, nonetheless). Remind participants that these are not presented as emotion regulation strategies (i.e., ways to reduce or end painful emotions), although they may help to regulate emotions. They are, instead, ways to survive painful emotions. 98 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER Discussion Point: Get participants to discuss where and why such strategies might be a good idea. That is, why is surviving a crisis a good idea? Pull for insight that temporary solutions are at times OK. B. Review specific skills. 1. Distracting methods have to do with reducing contact with emotional stimuli (events that set off emotions). Or, in some cases, they work to change parts of an emotional response. There are seven distracting skills. A useful way to remember these skills is the phrase \"Wise Mind ACCEPTS\": Activities Contributing ~omparisons Emotions Pushing away Thoughts !ensations a. Activities can work to modulate negative emotions in a number of ways. They distract attention and fill short-term memory with thoughts, images, and sensations counteractive to the thoughts, images,,,and sensations that activate and reactiv4te the negative emotion. They affect physiological responses and emotional expressive behavior directly. b. Contributing refocuses attention from oneself to what one can do for others. For some, contributing also increases a sense of meaning in life, thereby improving the moment (see below). For others, it also enhances self-respect. c. Making Comparisons also refocuses attention from oneself to others, but in a different way. In this case, the situations of others-those coping in the same way or less well, or the less fortunate in general-are used to recast one\\'s own situation in a more positive light. d. Generating opposite !motions replaces the current negative emotion with other, less negative emotions. This strategy interferes with the current mood state. This technique requires the person to first figure out the current emotion so that activities to generate an opposite one can be sought. e. !ushlng away from a situation can be done by leaving it physically or by blocking it in one\\'s mind. Leaving the situation decreases contact with the emotional cues associated with the situation. Blocking is a somewhat conscious effort to inhibit internal stimuli associated with negative emotions. Blocking is a bit like riding a bicycle; one only understands it when one does it. (Most borderline clients seem able to do this and will usually know what you mean as soon as you mention the technique.) It is perhaps related to the ability to dissociate or depersonalize. It should not be the first technique tried, but can be useful in an emergency. The secret is not to overuse it. f. Distracting with other Thoughts fills short-term memory withother thoughts so that thoughts activated by the negative emotion do not continue to reactivate the emotion. g. Intense other Sensations can interfere with the phySiological component of the current negative emotion. Also, the sensations may work to focus attention on something other than the stimuli arousing the emotion. Holding ice cubes,2 in particular, can be very helpful. In a skills group of a colleague of mine, a client brought everyone small refreezable ice packs. Several clients would then take them (frozen) to therapy sessions to hold onto when discussing very painful topics (e.g., sexual abuse that one client had not previously been able to discuss at all). This latter technique, while at times useful, would also need to be closely monitored so that it does not interfere with exposure to important and relevant cues. Discussion Point: Elicit any objections participants have to using distraction, and discuss. Cheerleading may be needed. 2. Self-soothing has to do with comforting, nurturing, and being gentle and kind to oneself. A way to remember these skills is to think of soothing each of the Five senses: Vision Hearing Smell Taste Touch Note to Leaders: The meaning and intent of these Distress Tolerance Skills 99 are reasonably self-evident, so you need to review only a few in session. You should devote more time to the following discussion point. Discussion Point: Borderline individuals often have difficulties with self-soothing. Some believe that they do not deserve soothing, kindness, and gentleness; they may feel guilty or ashamed when they self-soothe. Others believe that they should get soothing from others; they don\\'t self-soothe as a matter of principle, or feel angry at others when they attempt to self-soothe. Elicit examples from each participant. Note to Leaders: It is important that each participant learn to self-soothe. Even if at first it elicits anger or guilt, self-soothing should be repeatedly attempted. In time, it will become easier. Some clients may be quite resistant to practicing self-soothing. Keep a watchful eye on homework practice to be sure that each participant is at least trying these skills. Assess and problem-solve difficulties. 3. Improving the moment is replacing immediate negative events with more positive ones. Some strategies for improving the moment are cognitive techniques having to do with changing appraisals of oneself (encouragement) or the situation (positive thinking, meaning, imagining). Some involve changing body responses to events (relaxing). Prayer and focusing on one thing in the moment have to do with acceptance and letting go. A way to remember these skills is the word \"IMPROVE:\" !magery ~eaning ~rayer ~elaxation One thing in the moment Vacation !ncouragement a. imagery can be used to distract, soothe, bolster courage and confidence, and make future rewards more salient. Explain: \"Using imagery, you can create a situation different from the actualone; in this sense, it is like leaving the situation. With imagery, however, you can be sure that the place you go to is a safe and secure one. Going to an imaginary safe place or room within can be very helpful during flashbacks. For it to be useful, however, you have to practice it when you are not in a crisis enough times to get it firmly down as a skill.\" Imagery can also be used to cope more effectively with crises. Practicing effective coping in imagination can actually increase one\\'s chances of coping with it effectively in real life. b. Finding or creating Meaning helps many people in crises. Victor Frankl (1984) wrote an important book about surviving Nazi concentration camps, Man\\'s Search for Meaning, based on the premise that people need to find or create meaning in their lives to survive terrible suffering. Finding or creating meaning is similar to the dialectical strategy of making lemonade out of lemons. (See Chapter 7 of the text.) Discussion Point: It is important to note that life is at times unfair for reasons that no one can understand. People do not have to assume that there is a purpose to their suffering, although those who are religious or spiritual may see it this way. Those who do not believe in a higher purpose can still create meaning or purpose, however. Get feedback about participants\\' views on the meaning or purpose of suffering. c. The essence of ~rayer is the complete opening of oneself to the moment. This practice is very similar to the notion of radical acceptance, discussed later in this module. Note that the suggested prayer is not one of begging to have the suffering or crisis taken away. Nor is it a \"Why me?\" prayer. Practice Exercise: During the skills training session, have all participants dose their eyes, imagine or \"get in touch with\" a current pain or suffering, and then silently try each type of prayer (an acceptance prayer, a \"Deliver me\" prayer, a \"Why me?\" prayer). Have participants refocus on current suffering (for only a moment) before each attempt at prayer. Discuss afterwards. Or suggest that people who are comfortable with praying try each type of prayer during the next crisis and keep track of which type actually helps. d. !elaxing is changing how the body responds to stress and crises. Often people tense their bodies as if by keeping them tense, they can actually make the situation change. They try to control the situation by controlling their bodies. The goal here is to accept reality with the body. The idea is that the body communicates with the mind, accepting with the body can help in accepting with the mind. 100 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER Note to Leaders: Most clients who have been on an inpatient psychiatric unit will have gotten muscle relaxation training. Check on how they liked it and whether it was useful. You may also want to do some structured relaxation training here; any of the numerous audio-tapes available for this can be used. It is important to point out that relaxing is a skill that takes lots of practice. The breath and half-smiling exercises described below are relaxation exercises that promote acceptance and tolerance. They are specific and concrete, and both can be done in crisis situations. Practiced on a daily basis, they can prepare clients for crises. e. One thing in the moment is the second mindfulness \"how\" skill discussed in Chapter 7 of this manual. Although it can be very difficult to do, focusing on one thing in the moment can be very helpful in the middle of a crisis; it can provide time to settle down. The secret of this skill is to remember that the only pain one has to survive is \"just this moment.\" We all often suffer much more than is required by calling to mind past suffering and ruminating about future suffering we may have to endure. But, in reality, there is only \"just this moment.\" Because of the importance of this skill in reality acceptance, a number of specific exercises for improving focus and increasing awareness are taught in the next section of this module. Practice Exercise: During the session, have all participants close their eyes and imagine or \"get in touch with\" some current discomfort, irritation, or anxiety right now, this moment in the session. Instruct participants to raise a hand slightly when they have the focus. Instruct them to notice their level of current discomfort. Now instruct them to start ruminating about all the past times they have had to endure such feelings in sessions. Have them also bring to mind and ruminate about how much more of these feelings have to be endured in this skills training session and all future sessions. Instruct them to notice now their level of discomfort. Then have them refocus the mind on \"just this moment:\\' Explain: \"Say in your mind \\'just this moment.\\' Let go of thoughts of the future and the past:\\' Have them notice now their level of discomfort. Discuss the exercise. f. Taking a \"Vacation from adulthood\" is ceasing to cope actively and either retreating into oneself or allowing oneself to be taken care of for the moment. Explain: \"Everyone needs a vacation from adulthood once in a while. The trick is to take it in a way that does not harm you, and also to make sure the vacation is brief. It should only last from a few moments to no longer than a day. When you have responsibilities, taking a vacation depends on getting someone else to take over your duties for a while.\" The idea here is similar to Alan Marlatt\\'s (Marlatt & Gordon, 1985) use of planned relapses in the treatment of addictions. The focus is on the planned nature of the relapse (or, here, the planned vacation). It is similar to the notion of taking a timeout to regroup. Discussion Point: Borderline individuals are usually experts at taking vacations. The problem is that they are not in control of their vacations; that is, they take them at inappropriate times and stay on them too long. Making vacation taking a skill to be practiced, gives them the potential for getting in control. Elicit from participants times they have taken vacations in an out-ofcontrol fashion. Discuss ways to get in control of vacations and use them effectively. g. Encouragement is cheerleading oneself. Explain: \"The idea is to talk to yourself as you would talk to someone you care about who is in a crisis. Or talk to yourself as you would like someone else to talk to you.\" Leaders: You may at first need to do quite a bit of modeling here, as well as cheerleading. 4. Thinking of pros and cons consists of thinking about the positive and negative aspects of tolerating distress and the positive and negative aspects of not tolerating it. The eventual goal here is for the person to face the fact that accepting reality and tolerating distress lead to better outcomes than do rejecting reality and refusing to tolerate distress. Practice Exercise: Many borderline individuals react to crises and stress by harming themselves (parasuicidal behavior, substance abuse, \"throwing tantrums;\\' etc.). Make a \"pros\" column and a \"cons\" column on the blackboard. Get participants to generate pros and cons of tolerating a crisis without doing something harmful and/or impulsive. Then generate a list of pros and cons for not tolerating the crisis (for self-harm, substance abuse, or one or more other nontolerating responses the participants want to analyze). Be sure to focus on both short-term and long-term pros and cons. Compare the two sets of lists. Distress Tolerance Skills 101 S. Notes/Other Ideas is a space at the end of Handout 1 to write down ideas that participants generate for tolerating distress. Almost always, clients will have a number of creative strategies not on the list. Write these ideas down and ask other participants to do so. Discussion Point: Discuss with participants how these strategies can be overused in invalidating environments. Point out that the fact that they can be overused does not mean they have no value at all. Elicit and problem-solve \"resistance\" to using these skills. III. Go over breath, half-smiling, and awareness exercises. Note to Leaders: Ifyou are running short of time, give the general idea of each of these exercises, but let participants read and practice each specific one on their own. For those who find these exercises helpful, suggest that they read the book The Miracle of Mindfulness by Thich Nhat Hanh (1976). These exercises are drawn from that book.3 It is very important that leaders also practice these skills. A. Review Distress Tolerance Handout 2: Guidelines for Accepting Reality: Observing.:y\\'our-Breath Exercises. Lecture Point: All major religions and spiritual disciplines have as an important part of their contemplative and/or meditative practice a focus on breathing. The focus is intended to help the individuals accept and tolerate themselves, the world, and reality as it is. A focus on breathing is also an important part of relaxation training and the treatment of panic attacks. 1. Go over one or several breath exercises (using guidelines): a. Deep breathing. b. Measuring your breath by your footsteps. c. Counting your breath. d. Following your breath while listening to music. e. Following your breath while carrying on a conversation. f. Following the breath. g. Breathing to quiet the mind and body. 2. Have each participant select one breath exercise she would like to try during the coming week. B. Review Distress Tolerance Handout 3: Guidelines for Accepting Reality: Half-Smiling Exercises. 1. Explain: \"Half smiling is accepting and tolerating with your body. To do it, you relax your face, neck, and shoulder muscles, and then half-smile with your lips. Try to adopt a serene facial expression. Remember to relax the facial muscles.\" (See Chapter 11 of text and Chapter 9, this manual, for further discussion.) Lecture Point: Emotions are partially controlled by facial expressions. By adopting a half-smile-a serene, accepting face-people can control their emotions some what. They can feel more accepting if their faces express acceptance. 2. Go over one or more half-smiling exercises (using guidelines): a. Half-smile when you first awake in the mornmg. b. Half-smile during your free moments. c. Half-smile while listening to music. d. Half-smile when irritated. e. Half-smile in a lying down position. f. Half-smile in a sitting position. g. Half-smile while contemplating the person you hate or despise the most. Practice Exercise: Have participants sit very still. First, have them try to make a very impassive face-one with no expression-and experience how that feels. Then have them try actually relaxing the muscles of the face -from the forehead, to the eyes, to the cheeks, and to the mouth and jaw-and experience how that feels. Finally, have them half-smile and experience how that feels. Discuss the differences. 3. Have each participant select one half smiling exercise she would like to try during the coming week. C. Review Distress Tolerance Handout 4: Guidelines for Accepting Reality: Awareness Exercises. Lecture Point: These exercises can be very helpful in the middle of a crisis. When practiced every day, they can help develop a more accepting state of mind. 1. Go over one of several awareness exercises (using guidelines): a. Awareness of the positions of the body. b. Awareness of connection to the universe. c. Awareness while making tea or coffee. d. Awareness while washing the dishes. e. Awareness while hand-washing clothes. f. Awareness while cleaning house. 102 SKILLS TRAINING MANUAL FOR TREATING BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER g. Awareness while taking a slow-motion bath. h. Practicing awareness with meditation. 2. Have each participant select an awareness exercise she would like to try during the coming week. Note to Leaders: Do not underestimate the value of these awareness exercises for getting through very difficult times. In truly desperate times, these can be exceptionally valuable. In my experience, almost all borderline individuals like and use these -at least if you first push them to give them a try. Notice that one could make up any number of variations. IV. Review Distress Tolerance Handout 5: Basic Principles of Accepting Reality. Note to Leaders: Homework practice sheet for these skills and the remaining skills in this module is Distress Tolerance Homework Sheet 2: Acceptance and Willingness. A. Radical acceptance is letting go of fighting reality. The term \"radical\" means to imply that the acceptance has to come from deep within and has to be complete. Acceptance is the only way out of hell. It is the way to tum suffering that cannot be tolerated into pain that can be tolerated. Pain is part of living; it can be emotional and it can be physical. Pain is nature\\'s way of signaling that something is wrong, or that something needs to be done. 1. The pain of a hand on a hot stove causes a person to move her hand quickly. People without the sensation of pain are in deep trouble. 2. The pain of grief causes people to reach out for others who are lost. Without it there would probably be no societies or cultures. No one would look after those who are sick, would search for loved ones who are lost, or would stay with people who are difficult at times. 3. Pain of fear makes people avoid what is dangerous. 4. Pain of anger makes people overcome obstacles. Discussion Point: What are the pros and cons of never having painful emotions? Would participants like people who never have painful emotions? Lecture Point: Suffering is pain plus nonacceptance of the pain. Suffering comes when people are unable or refuse to accept pain. Suffering comes when people cling to getting what they want, refusing to accept what they have. Suffering comes when people resist reality as it is at the moment. Pain can be difficult or almost impossible to bear, but suffering is even more difficult. Refusal to accept reality and the suffering that goes along with it can interfere with reducing pain. It is like a cloud that surrounds pain, interfering with the ability to see it dearly. Radical acceptance transforms suffering to pain. Discussion Point: When acceptance is used as a technique to create change -as a sort of \"bargain with God\" (\"I\\'ll accept it, and in return you promise to make it better\") -is not really acceptance. Elicit examples of bargaining from participants. Note to Leaders: The point of radical acceptance is extremely difficult for borderline individuals (and some leaders) to see. They have great difficulty seeing that they can accept something without approving of it. They believe that if they accept what is, they cannot change it. Trying to get them to accept the notion of acceptance, can become a power struggle. As a shaping strategy, you might suggest the terms \"acknowledge;\\' \"recognize;\\' or \"endure;\\' Discuss these points. You will probably have to discuss them over and over again. Great patience is needed, but don\\'t give up on radical acceptance. Discussion Point: A great myth is that if people don\\'t accept something, if they simply refuse to put up with it, it will magically change. It is as if resistance andlor willpower alone, will change it. Get examples of this. Discuss why participants might believe this. Elicit examples of when tantrums and verbal refusals to accept things have been reinforced. Discussion Point: Some people are afraid that if they ever actually accept their painful situation or emotions, they will become passive and just give up (or give in). Elicit and discuss fears of participants. Explain: \"Imagine that you hate the color purple. Then imagine that your room is painted purple. If you refuse to accept that the room is purple, you will never paint it a color you want.\" Elicit examples of when accepting things as they are has helped to reduce suffering and resulted in a greater ability to reduce the source of pain. (This point is taken up again below under willingness versus willfulness.) Discussion Point: The notion of acceptance is central to every major religion, East and West. Elicit participants\\' reactions to this and any experiences they have. The idea is also similar to the Alcoholics Anonymous notion of surrendering to a higher power and accepting things one cannot change. Distress Tolerance Skills 10] B. Turning the mind is choosing to accept. Acceptance seems to require some sort of choice. People have to turn their minds in that direction, so to speak. Acceptance sometimes only lasts a moment or two, so people have to keep turning the mind over and over and over. The choice has to be made every day-sometimes many, many times a day, or even an hour or a minute. Discussion Point: Discuss all the reasons why not to accept, to turn the mind. Elicit reasons from participants. What makes it so difficult to take that first step? C. The notion of willingness versus willfulness is taken from Gerald May\\'s (1982) book on the topic. 1. Willingness is accepting what is, together with responding to what is, in an effective or appropriate way. It is doing what works. It is doing just what is needed in the current situation or moment. 2. Willfulness is imposing one\\'s will on reality-trying to fix everything, or refusing to do what is needed. It is the opposite of doing what works. Lecture Point: Use metaphors to explain willingness versus willfulness. One is that life is like hitting baseballs from a pitching machine. A person\\'s job is just to do her best to hit each ball as it comes. Refusing to accept that a ball is coming does not make it stop coming. Willpower, defiance, crying, or whimpering does not make the machine stop pitching the balls; they keep coming over and over and over. A person can stand in the way of a ball and get hit, stand there doing nothing and let the ball go by as a strike, or swing at the ball. Another metaphor is that life is like a game of cards. It makes no difference to a good card player what cards she gets. The object is to play whatever hand she gets as well as possible. As soon as one hand is played, another hand is dealt. The last game is over and the current game is on. The idea is to be mindful of the current hand, play it as skillfully as possible, and then let go and focus on the next hand of cards. Many other metaphors (e.g., life as a computer game) can be used also. Discussion Point: Elicit examples of willingness and willfulness. Leaders: If you can point to recent examples of yourselves\\' and/or panicipants\\' being willful or willing, so much the better. A light touch is needed. Discuss May\\'s definitions. Elicit agreements and disagreements. Practice Exercise: The best way to get the ideas of willingness and willfulness off the written page and into active use is to stan highlighting during skills training sessions when you (the leaders) and/or the clients are behaving willfully and when willingly. Phrase it as a question: \"Do you all think I am being willful here? Hmmm, let\\'s examine this;\\' or \"You\\'re not by chance being willful about this, are you?\" (Clients will usually rather enjoy catching the leaders in willfulness.) Or when a difficult situation or conflict emerges in a session, you can say, \"OK. Let\\'s all try to be completely willing for the next 5 minutes.\" V. Summarize rationale for distress tolerance, crisis survival strategies, radical acceptance, willingness and willfulness. Notes 1. R. Matthew Kamins, Cornell Medical Center/New York Hospital at White Plains, made very helpful comments about how to reorganize these skills. 2. Steve Hollon of Vanderbilt University gave me this idea. 3.

Have a \"TEFLON MIND,\" letting experiences, feelings, and thoughts come into your mind and slip right out. CONTROL your attention, but not what you see. Push away nothing. Cling to nothing. Be like a guard at the palace gate, ALERT to every thought, feeling, and action that comes through the gate of your mind. Step inside yourself and observe. WATCH your thoughts coming and going, like clouds in the sky. Notice each feeling, rising and falling, like waves in the ocean. Notice exactly what you are doing. Notice what comes through your SENSES-your eyes, ears, nose, skin, tongue. See others\\' actions and expressions. \"Smell the roses.\" DESCRIBE ., PUT WORDS ON THE EXPERIENCE. When a feeling or thought arises, or you do something, acknowledge it. For example, say in your mind, \"Sadness has just enveloped me.\" ... or ... \"Stomach muscles tightnening\" ... or \"A thought \\'I can\\'t do this\\' has come into my mind.\" ... or ... \"walking, step. step. step \" PUT EXPERIENCES INTO WORDS. Describe to yourself what is happening. Put a name on your feelings. Call a thought just a thought. a feeling just a feeling. Don\\'t get caught in content. PARTICIPATE Enter into your experiences. Let yourself get involved in the moment, letting go of ruminating. BECOME ONE WITH YOUR EXPERIENCE, COMPLETELY FORGETTING YOURSELF. ACT INTUITIVELY from wise mind. Do just what is needed in each situation-a skillful dancer on the dance floor. one with the music and your partner, neither willful nor sitting on your hands. Actively PRACTICE your skills as you learn them until they become part of you, where you use them without self-consciousness. PRACTICE: I. Changing harmful situations. 2. Changing your harmful reactions to situations. 3. Accepting yourself and the situation as they are.

III MINDFULNESS HANDOUT 3 Taking Hold of Your Mind: \"How\" Skills NON-JUDGMENTALLY See but DON\\'T EVALUATE. Take a nonjudgmental stance. just the facts. Focus on the \"what,\" not the \"good\" or \"bad,\" the \"terrible\" or \"wonderful,\" the \"should\" or \"should not.\" UNGLUE YOUR OPINIONS from the facts, from the \"who, what, when, and where.\" ACCEPT each moment, each event as a blanket spread out on the lawn accepts both the rain and the sun, each leaf that falls upon it. ACKNOWLEDGE the helpful. the wholesome, but don\\'t judge it. Acknowledge the harmful, the unwholesome, but don\\'t judge it. When you find yourself judging, DON\\'T JUDGE YOUR JUDGING. ONE-MINDFULLY DO ONE THING AT A TIME. When you are eating, eat. When you are walking, walk. When you are bathing, bathe. When you are working, work. When you are in a group, or a conversation, focus your attention on the very moment you are in with the other person. When you are thinking, think. When you are worrying, worry. When you are planning, plan. When you are remembering, remember. Do each thing with all of your attention. If other actions, or other thoughts, or strong feelings distract you, LET GO OF DISTRACTIONS and go back to what you are doing-again, and again, and again. CONCENTRATE YOUR MIND. If you find you are doing two things at once, stop and go back to one thing at a time. EFFECTIVELY FOCUS ON WHAT WORKS. Do what needs to be done in each situation. Stay away from \"fair\" and \"unfair,\" \"right\" and \"wrong,\" \"should\" and \"should not.\" PLAY BY THE RULES. Don\\'t \"cut off your nose to spite your face.\" Act as SKILLFULLY as you can, meeting the needs of the situation you are in. Not the situation you wish you were in; not the one that is just; not the one that is more comfortable; not the one that.... Keep an eye on YOUR OBJECTIVES in the situation and do what is necessary to achieve them. LET GO of vengeance, useless anger, and righteousness that hurts you and doesn\\'t work. From Skills Training Manual for Treating Borderline Disorder Personality by Marsha Linehan. 1993 The Guilford Press. 113 INTERPERSONAL EFFECTIVENESS HANDOUT I Situations for Interpersonal Effectiveness ATTENDING TO RELATIONSHIPS Don\\'t let hurts and problems build up. Use relationship skills to head off problems. End hopless relationships. Resolve conflicts before they get overwhelming. BALANCING PRIORITIES V5. DEMANDS If overwhelmed, reduce or put off low-priority demands. Ask others for help; say no when necessary. If not enough to do. try to create some structure and responsibilities; offer to do things. BALANCING THE WANTS~OSHOULDS Look at what you do because you enjoy doing it and \"want\" to do it; and how much you do because it has to be done and you \"should\" do it. Try to keep the number of each in balance, even if you have to: Get your opinions taken seriously. Get others to do things. Say no to unwanted requests. BUILDING MASTERY AND SELF-RESPECT Interact in a way that makes you feel competent and effective, not helpless and overly dependent. Stand up for yourself, your beliefs and opinions; follow you own wise mind. From Skills Training Manual for Treating 6arder/ine Disorder Personality by Marsha Linehan. 1993 The Guilford Press. 115 INTERPERSONAL EFFECTIVENESS HANDOUT 2 Goals of Interpersonal Effectiveness OBJECTIVES EFFECTIVENESS: Getting Your Objectives or Goals in a Situation Obtaining your legitimate rights Getting another to do something Refusing an unwanted or unreasonable request Resolving an interpersonal conflict Getting your opinion or point of view taken seriously QUESTIONS I. What specific results or changes do I want from this interaction? 2. What do I have todo to get the results? What will work? RELATIONSHIP EFFECTIVENESS: Getting or Keeping a Good Relationship Acting in such a way that the other person keeps liking and respecting you Balancing immediate goals with the good of the long-term relationship QUESTIONS I. How do I want the other person to feel about me after the interaction is over? 2. What do I have todo to get (or keep) this relationship? SELF-RESPECT EFFECTIVENESS: Keeping or Improving Self-Respect and Liking for Yourself Respecting your own values and beliefs; acting in a way that makes you feel moral Acting in a way that makes you feel capable and effective QUESTIONS I. How do I want to feel about myself after the interaction is over? 2. What do I have todo to feel that way about myse/r What will work? From Skills Training Manual for Treating Borderline Personality Disorder by Marsha Linehan. 1993 The Guilford Press. 116 INTERPERSONAL EFFECTIVENESS HANDOUT 3 Factors Reducing Interpersonal Effectiveness LACK OF SKILL You actually DON\\'T KNOW what to say or how to act. You don\\'t know how you should behave to achieve your objectives. You don\\'t know what will work. WORRY THOUGHTS Worry thoughts get in the way of your ability to act effectively. You have the ability, but your worry thoughts interfere with doing or saying what you want. WORRIES ABOUT BAD CONSEQUENCES. \"They won\\'t like me,\" \"She will think I am stupid.\" WORRIES ABOUT WHETHER YOU DESERVE TO GET WHAT YOU WANT. \"I am such a bod person I don\\'t deserve this.\" WORRIES ABOUT NOT BEING EFFECTIVE AND CALLING YOURSELF NAMES. \"I won\\'t do it right,\" \"I\\'ll probably fall apart,\" \"I\\'m so stupid.\" EMOTIONS Your emotions (ANGER, FRUSTRArlON, FEAR, GUILT) get in the way of your ability to act effectively. You have the ability, but your emotions make you unable to do or say what you want. Emotions, instead of skill, control what you say and do. INDECISION You CAN\\'T DECIDE what to do or what you really want. You have the ability, but your indecision gets in the way of doing or saying what you want. You are ambivalent about your priorities. You can\\'t figure out how to balance: Asking for too much versus not asking for anything. Saying no to everything versus giving in to everything. ENVIRONMENT Characteristics of the environment make it impossible for even a very skilled person to be effective. SKILLFUL BEHAVIOR DOESN\\'T WORK. Other people are too powerful. Other people will be threatened or have some other reason for not liking you if you get what you want. Other people won\\'t give you what you need or let you say no without punishing you unless you sacrifice your self-respect, at least a little.

I can understand and validate another person, and still ask for what I want. II. There is no law that says other people\\'s opinions are more valid than mine. 12. I may want to please people I care about, but I don\\'t have to please them all the time. 13. Giving, giving. giving is not the be-all of life. I am an important person in this world, too. 14.

I am under no obligation to say yes to people simply because they ask a favor of me. 16. The fact that I say no to someone does not make me a selfish person. 17.

From Skills Training Manual for Treating Borderline Personality Disorder by Marsha Linehan.  1993 The Guilford Press. 152 EMOTION REGULATION HANDOUT 5 What Good Are Emotions? EMOTIONS COMMUNICATE TO (AND INFLUENCE) OTHERS. Facial expressions are a hard-wired part of emotions. In primitive societies and among animals, facial expressions communicate like words. Even in modern societies, facial expressions communicate faster than words. When it is important to us to communicate to others, or send them a message, it can be very hard for us to change our emotions. Whether we intend it or not, the communication of emotions influences others. EMOTIONS ORGANIZE AND MOTIVATE ACTION. Emotions motivate our behavior. The action urge connected to specific emotions is often \"hard-wired.\" Emotions prepare us for action. Emotions save time in getting us to act in important situations. We don\\'t have to think everything through. Strong emotions help us overcome obstacles-in our mind and in the environment. EMOTIONS CAN BE SELF-VALIDATING. Our emotional reactions to other people and to events can give us information about the situation. Emotions can be signals or alarms that something is happening. When this is carried to an extreme, emotions are treated as facts: \"If I feel incompetent, I am.\" \"If I get depressed when left alone, I shouldn\\'t be left alone.\" \"If I feel right about something, it is right.\" \"If I\\'m afraid, it is threatening.\" \"I love him, so he must be OK:\\' From Skills Training Manual for Tteating Borderline Personolity Disorder by Marsha Linehan. 1993 The Guilford Press. 153 - - EMOTION REGULATION HANDOUT 6 Reducing Vulnerability to Negative Emotions: How to Stay Out of Emotion Mind A way to remember these skills is to remember the term \"PLEASE MASTER:\\' Treat Physical illnessBalance ~ating Avoid mood-Altering drugs Balance Sleep Get Exercise Build MASTERy I.

From Skills Training Manual for Treating Borderline Personality Disorder by Marsha Linehan. 1993 The Guilford Press. 167 DISTRESS TOLERANCE HANDOUT I: Crisis Survival Strategies (cont.) IMPROVE THE MOMENT A way to remember these skills is the word IMPROVE. With !magery: Imagine very relaxing scenes. Imagine a secret room within yourself, seeing how it is decorated. Go into the room whenever you feel very threatened. Close the door on anything that can hurt you. Imagine everything going well. Imagine coping well. Make up a fantasy world that is calming and beautiful and let your mind go with it. Imagine hurtful emotions draining out of you like water out of a pipe. With Meaning: Find or create some purpose, meaning, or value in the pain. Remember, listen to, or read about spiritual values. Focus on whatever positive aspects of a painful situation you can find. Repeat them over and over in your mind. Make lemonade out of lemons. With ~rayer: Open your heart to a supreme being, greater wisdom, God, your own wise mind. Ask for strength to bear the pain in this moment. Turn things over to God or a higher being. With Relaxation: Try muscle relaxing by tensing and relaxing each large muscle group, starting with your hands and arms, going to the top of your head, and then working down; listen to a relaxation tape; exercise hard; take a hot bath or sit in a hot tub; drink hot milk; massage your neck and scalp, your calves and feet. Get in a tub filled with very cold or hot water and stay in it until the water is tepid. Breathe deeply; half-smile; change facial expression. With One thing in the moment: Focus your entire attention on just what you are doing right now. Keep yourself in the very moment you are in; put your mind in the present. Focus your entire attention on physical sensations that accompany nonmental tasks (e.g. walking, washing, doing dishes, cleaning, fixing). Be aware of how your body moves during each task. Do awareness exercises. From Skills Training Manual for TteOting 80rderline Personality Disorder by Marsha Linehan. 1993 The Guilford Press. 168 DISTRESS TOLERANCE HANDOUT I: Crisis Survival Strategies (cont.) With a brief Vacation: Give yourself a brief vacation. Get in bed and pull the covers up over your head for 20 minutes. Rent a motel room at the beach or in the woods for a day or two; drop your towels on the floor after you use them. Ask your roommate to bring you coffee in bed or make you dinner (offer to reciprocate). Get a schlocky magazine or newspaper at the grocery store, get in bed with chocolates, and read it. Make yourself milk toast, bundle up in a chair, and eat it slowly. Take a blanket to the park and sit on it for a whole afternoon. Unplug your phone for a day, or let your answering machine screen your calls. Take a I-hour breather from hard work that must be done. With ~ncouragement: Cheerlead yourself. Repeat over and over: \"I can stand it;\\' \"It won\\'t last forever;\\' \"I will make it out of this;\\' I\\'m doing the best I can do.\" Thinking of PROS AND CONS Make a list of the pros and cons of tolerating the distress. Make another list of the pros and cons of not tolerating the distress -that is, of coping by hurting yourself, abusing alcohol or drugs, or doing something else impulsive. Focus on long-term goals, the light at the end of the tunnel. Remember times when pain has ended. Think of the positive consequences of tolerating the distress. Imagine in your mind how good you will feel if you achieve your goals, if you don\\'t act impulsively. Think of all of the negative consequences of not tolerating your current distress. Remember what has happened in the past when you have acted impulsively to escape the moment. From Skills Training Manual far Treating Borderline Personality Disorder by Marsha Linehan. 1993 The Guilford Press. 169 DISTRESS TOLERANCE HANDOUT 2 Guidelines for Accepting Reality: Observing-Your-Breath Exercises OBSERVING YOUR BREATH: Focus your attention on your breath, coming in and out. Observe your breathing as a way to center yourself in your wise mind. Observe your breathing as a way to take hold of your mind, dropping off nonacceptance and fighting reality. I. DEEP BREATHING Lie on your back. Breathe evenly and gently, focusing your attention on the movement of your stomach. As you begin to breathe in, allow your stomach to rise in order to bring air into the lower half of your lungs. As the upper halves of your lungs begin to fill with air, your chest begins to rise and your stomach begins to lower. Don\\'t tire yourself. Continue for 10 breaths. The exhalation will be longer that the inhalation. 2. MEASURING YOUR BREATH BY YOUR FOOTSTEPS Walk slowly in a yard, along a sidewalk, or on a path. Breathe normally. Determine the length of your breath, the exhalation and the inhalation, by the number of your footsteps. Continue for a few minutes. Begin to lengthen your exhalation by one step. Do not force a longer inhalation. Let it be natural. Watch your inhalation carefully to see whether there is a desire to lengthen it. Continue for 10 breaths. Now lengthen the exhalation by one more footstep. Watch to see whether the inhalation also lengthens by one step or not. Only lengthen the inhalation when you feel that it will give delight. After 20 breaths, return your breath to normal. About 5 minutes later, you can begin the practice of lengthened breaths again. When you feel the least bit tired, return to normal. After several sessions of the practice of lengthened breath, your exhalation and inhalation will grow equal in length. Do not practice long, equal breaths for more than 10 to 20 breaths before returning to normal. 3. COUNTING YOUR BREATH Sit cross-legged on the floor (sit in the half or full lotus position if you know how); or sit in a chair with your feet on the floor; or kneel; or lie flat on the floor; or take a walk. As you inhale, be aware that \"I am inhaling, 1:\\' When you exhale, be aware that \"I am exhaling, 1:\\' Remember to breathe from the stomach. When beginning the second inhalation, be aware that \"I am inhaling, 2:\\' And slowly exhaling, be aware that \"I am exhaling, 2.\" Continue on up through 10. After you have reached 10, return to 1. Whenever you lose count, return to 1. (cant.) From Skills Training Manual for Treating Borderline Disorder by Marsha Linehan.  1993 The Guilford Press. 170 DISTRESS TOLERANCE HANDOUT 2 (cont.) 4. FOLLOWING YOUR BREATH WHILE LISTENING TO MUSIC Listen to a piece of music. Breathe long, light, and even breaths. Follow your breath; be master of it while remaining aware of the movement and sentiments of the music. Do not get lost in the music, but continue to be master of your breath and yourself. 5. FOLLOWING YOUR BREATH WHILE CARRYING ON A CONVERSATION Breathe long, light, and even breaths. Follow your breath while listening to a friend\\'s words and to your own replies. Continue as with the music. 6. FOLLOWING THE BREATH Sit cross-legged on the floor (sit in the half or full lotus position if you know how); or sit in a chair with your feet on the floor; or kneel; or lie flat on the floor; or take a walk. Begin to inhale gently and normally (from the stomach), aware that \"I am inhaling normally.\" Exhale in awareness, \"I am exhaling normally.\" Continue for three breaths. On the fourth breath, extend the inhalation, aware that \"I am breathing in a long inhalation.\" Exhale in awareness, \"I am breathing out a long exhalation.\" Continue for three breaths. Now follow your breath carefully, aware of every movement of your stomach and lungs. Follow the entrance and exit of air. Be aware that \"I am inhaling and following the inhalation from its beginning to its end. I am exhaling and following the exhalation from its beginning to its end.\" Continue for 20 breaths. Return to normal. After 5 minutes, repeat the exercise. Maintain a half-smile while breathing. Once you have mastered this exercise, move on to the next. 7. BREATHING TO QUIET THE MIND AND BODY Sit cross-legged on the floor (sit in half or fulllotlls position if you know how); or sit in a chair with your feet on the floor; or kneel; or lie flat on the floor. Half-smile. Follow your breath. When your mind and body are quiet, continue to inhale and exhale very lightly; be aware that \"I am breathing in and making the breath and body light and peaceful. 1 am exhaling and making the breath and body light and peaceful:\\' Continue for three breaths, giving rise to the thought, \"I am breathing in while my body and mind are at peace. I am breathing out while my body and mind are at peace.\" Maintain this thought in awareness from 5 to 30 minutes, according to your ability and to the time available to you. The beginning and end of the practice should be relaxed and gentle. When you want to stop, gently massage the muscles in your legs before returning to a normal sitting position. Wait a moment before standing up. Note. Adapted from The Miracle of Mindfulness: A Manual of Meditation (pp. 81-84) by Thich Nhat Hanh, 1976, Boston: Beacon Press. Copyright 1987 by Mobi Ho.

From Skills Training Manual for Treating Borderline Personality Disorder by Marsha Linehan. 1993 The Guilford Press. 171 DISTRESS TOLERANCE HANDOUT 3 Guidelines for Accepting Reality: Half-Smiling Exercises HALF-SMILE Accept reality with your body. Relax (by letting go or by just tensing and then letting go) your face, neck, and shoulder muscles and half-smile with your lips. A tense smile is a grin (and might tell the brain you are hiding or masking). A half-smile is slightly up-turned lips with a relaxed face. Try to adopt a serene facial expression. Remember, your body communicates to your mind. I. HALFwSMILE WHEN YOU FIRST AWAKE IN THE MORNING Hang a branch, any other sign, or even the word \"smile\" on the ceiling or wall so that you see it right away when you open your eyes. This sign will serve as your reminder. Use these seconds before you get out of bed to take hold of your breath. Inhale and exhale three breaths gently while maintaining a half-smile. Follow your breaths. 2. HALFwSMILE DURING YOUR FREE MOMENTS Anywhere you find yourself sitting or standing, half-smile. Look at a child, a leaf, a painting on a wall, or anything that is relatively still, and smile. Inhale and exhale quietly three times. 3. HALFwSMILE WHILE LISTENING TO MUSIC Listen to a piece of music for 2 or 3 minutes. Pay attention to the words, music, rhythm, and sentiments of the music you are listening to (not your daydreams of other times). Half-smile while watching your inhalations and exhalations. 4. HALFwSMILE WHEN IRRITATED When you realize \"I\\'m irritated;\\' half-smile at once. Inhale and exhale quietly, maintaining a half-smile for three breaths. . 5. HALFwSMILE IN A LYINGwDOWN POSITION Lie on your back on a flat surface without the support of mattress or pillow. Keep your two arms loosely by your sides and keep your two legs slightly apart, stretched out before you. Maintain a half-smile. Breathe in and out gently, keeping your attention focused on your breath. Let go of every muscle in your body. Relax each muscle as though it were sinking down through the floor, or as though it were as soft and yielding as a piece of silk hanging in the breeze to dry. Let go entirely, keeping your attention only on your breath and half-smile. Think of yourself as a cat, completely relaxed before a warm fire, whose muscles yield without resistance to anyone\\'s touch. Continue for 15 breaths. From Skills Training Manual for Treating Borderline Personality Disorder by Marsha Linehan. 1993 The Guilford Press.( cont.) 172 DISTRESS TOLERANCE HANDOUT 3 (cont.) 6. HALF-SMILE IN A SITTING POSITION Sit on the floor with your back straight, or on a chair with your two feet touching the floor. Half-smile. Inhale and exhale while maintaining the half-smile. Let go. 7. HALF-SMILE WHILE CONTEMPLATING THE PERSON YOU HATE OR DESPISE THE MOST Sit quietly. Breathe and smile a half-smile. Imagine the image of the person who has caused you the most suffering. Regard the features you hate or despise the most or find the most repulsive. Try to examine what makes this person happy and what causes suffering in his or her daily life. Imagine the person\\'s perceptions; try to see what patterns of thought and reason this person follows. Examine what motivates this person\\'s hopes and actions. Finally, consider the person\\'s consciousness. See whether the person\\'s views and insights are open and free or not, and whether or not the person has been influenced by any prejudices, narrow-mindedness, hatred, or anger. See whether or not the person is master of himself or herself. Continue until you feel compassion rise in your heart like a well filling with fresh water, and your anger and resentment disappear. Practice this exercise many times on the same person. Notes/Other times to half-smile: Note.

From Skills Training Manual for Treating Borderline #\\'emmality Disorder by Marsha Linehan. 1993 The Guilford Press. 173 DISTRESS TOLERANCE HANDOUT 4 Guidelines for Accepting Reality: Awareness Exercises I. AWARENESS OF THE POSITIONS OF THE BODY This can be practiced in any time and place. Begin to focus your attention on your breath. Breathe quietly and more deeply than usual. Be mindful of the position of your body, whether you are walking, standing, lying, or sitting down. Know where you walk, stand, lie, or sit. Be aware of the purpose of your position. For example, you might be conscious that you are standing on a green hillside in order to refresh yourself, to practice breathing, or just to stand. If there is no purpose, be aware that there is no purpose. 2. AWARENESS OF CONNECTION TO THE UNIVERSE This can be practiced any time, any place. Focus your attention on where your body touches an object (floor or ground, air molecules, a chair or arm rest, your bed sheets and covers, your clothes, etc.). Try to see all the ways you are connected to and accepted by that object. Consider the function of that object with relation to you. That is, consider what the object does for you. Consider its kindness in doing that. Experience the sensation of touching the object and focus your entire attention on that kindness until a sense of being connected or loved or cared for arises in your heart. Examples: Focus your attention on your feet touching the ground. Consider the kindness of the ground holding you up, providing a path for you to get to other things, not letting you fall away from everything else. Focus your attention on your body touching the chair you sit in. Consider how the chair accepts you totally, holds you up, supports your back, keeps you from falling down on the floor. Focus your attention on the sheets and covers on your bed. Consider the touch of the sheets and covers holding you, surrounding and keeping you warm and comfortable. Consider the walls in the room. They keep out the wind and the cold and the rain. Think of how the walls are connected to you via the floor and the air in the room. Experience your connection to the walls that provide you with a secure place to do things. Go hug a tree. Think of how you and the tree are connected. Life is in you and in the tree and both of you are warmed by the sun, held by the air and supported by the earth. Try and experience the tree loving you by providing something to lean on, or by shading you. 3. AWARENESS WHILE MAKING TEA OR COFFEE Prepare a pot of tea or coffee to serve a guest or to drink by yourself. Do each movement slowly, in awareness. Do not let one detail of your movements go by without being aware of it. Know that your hand lifts the pot by its handle. Know that you are pouring the fragrant, warm tea or coffee into the cup. Follow each step in awareness. Breathe gently and more deeply than usual. Take hold of your breath if your mind strays. From Skills Training Manual (or Treating Borderline Personality Disorder by Marsha linehan. 1993 The Guilford Press. 174 DISTRESS TOLERANCE HANDOUT 4 (cant.) 4. AWARENESS WHILE WASHING THE DISHES Wash the dishes consciously, as though each bowl is an object of contemplation. Consider each bowl as sacred. Follow your breath to prevent your mind from straying. Do not try to hurry to get the job over with. Consider washing the dishes the most important thing in life. 5. AWARENESS WHILE HANDWASHING CLOTHES Do not wash too many clothes at one time. Select only three or four articles of clothing. Find the most comfortable position to sit or stand so as to prevent a backache. Scrub the clothes consciously. Hold your attention on every movement of your hands and arms. Pay attention to the soap and water. When you have finished scrubbing and rinsing, your mind and body will feel as clean and fresh as your clothes. Remember to maintain a half-smile and take hold of your breath whenever your mind wanders. 6. AWARENESS WHILE CLEANING HOUSE Divide your work into stages: straightening things and putting away books, scrubbing the toilet, scrubbing the bathroom, sweeping the floors, and dusting. Allow a good length of time for each task. Move slowly, three times more slowly than usual. Focus your attention fully on each task. For example, while placing a book on the shelf, look at the book, be aware of what book it is, know that you are in the process of placing it on the shelf, and know that you intend to put it in that specific place. Know that your hand reaches for the book, and picks it up. Avoid any abrupt or harsh movement. Maintain awareness of the breath, especially when your thoughts wander. 7. AWARENESS WHILE TAKING A SLOW-MOTION BATH Allow yourself 30 to 45 minutes to take a bath. Don\\'t hurry for even a second. From the moment you prepare the bath water to the moment you put on clean clothes, let every motion be light and slow. Be attentive of every movement. Place your attention to every part of your body, without discrimination or fear. Be aware of each stream of water on your body. By the time you\\'ve finished, your mind will feel as peaceful and light as your body. Follow your breath. Think of yourself as being in a clean and fragrant lotus pond in the summer. 8. PRACTICING AWARENESS WITH MEDITATION Sit comfortably on the floor with your back straight, on the floor or in a chair with both feet touching the floor. Close your eyes all the way, or open them slightly and gaze at something near. With each breath, say to yourself, quietly and gently, the word \"One:\\' As you inhale, say the word \"One.\" As you exhale, say the word \"One;\\' calmly and slowly. Try to collect your whole mind and put it into this one word. When your mind strays, return gently to saying \"One.\" If you start wanting to move, try not to move. Just gently observe wanting to move. Continue practicing a little past wanting to stop. Just gently observe wanting to stop. Note.

From Skills Training Manual for Treating Borderline Personality Disorder by Marsha Linehan. 1993 The Guilford Press. 175 DISTRESS TOLERANCE HANDOUT 5 Basic Principles of Accepting Reality RADICAL ACCEPTANCE Freedom from suffering requires ACCEPTANCE from deep within of what is. Let yourself go completely with what is. Let go of fighting reality. ACCEPTANCE is the only way out of hell. Pain creates suffering only when you refuse to ACCEPT the pain. Deciding to tolerate the moment is ACCEPTANCE. ACCEPTANCE is acknowledging what is. To ACCEPT something is not the same as judging it good. TURNING THE MIND Acceptance of reality as it is requires an act of CHOICE. It is like coming to a fork in the road. You have to turn your mind towards the acceptance road and away from the \"rejecting reality\" road. You have to make an inner COMMITMENT to accept. The COMMITMENT to accept does not itself equal acceptance. It just turns you toward the path. But it is the first step. You have to turn your mind and commit to acceptance OVER AND OVER AND OVER again. Sometimes. you have to make the commitment many times in the space of a few minutes. From Skills Training Manual far Treating Borderline Personality Disorder by Marsha Linehan. 1993 The Guilford Press, 176 DISTRESS TOLERANCE HANDOUT 5 (cont.) WILLINGNESS Cultivate a WILLING response to each situation. Willingness is DOING JUST WHAT IS NEEDED in each situation, in an unpretentious way. It is focusing on effectiveness. Willingness is listening very carefully to your WISE MIND, acting from your inner self. Willingness is ALLOWING into awareness your connection to the universeto the earth, to the floor you are standing on, to the chair you are sitting on, to the person you are talking to. (over) WILLFULNESS Replace WILLFULNESS with WILLINGNESS. Willfulness is SITTING ON YOUR HANDS when action is needed, refusing to make changes that are needed. Willfulness is GIVING UP. Willfulness is the OPPOSITE OF \"DOING WHAT WORKS,\" being effective. Willfulness is trying to FIX every situation. Willfulness is REFUSING TO TOLERATE the moment.    Introduction: How This Program Can Change Your Life j f you feel pain much of the time or if you have repeated episodes of severe pain, you JL are aware of how it affects the quality of your entire life. Perhaps only you know the favorite activities you have given up, the outings you\\'ve declined, even the friends you have lost because of your pain-induced limitations. Perhaps you have tried medical treatments such as prescription drugs, physical therapy, or even surgery. When these have led to limited success, your health care providers may have told you, \"\\'We\\'ve done all we can, you will just have to learn to live with it.\" This dismissive comment is very disheartening because you do not want to live with your pain. You had been living with your pain for too long even before you sought treatment. Rather, you want to live without it! If these practitioners had told you how you can live with pain in a way that allows you to reclaim your life, that might have been a different story. If they had told you how you could bring quality and happiness back into your life by taking simple steps consistently, you might have had realistic hope again. That is where this program beginswith the restoration of hope. By following a program that is deceptively simple, free, and clinically proven, you will, day by day and week by week, reclaim your life. Each of the self-management lessons in this book is backed by research and has been clinically proven to help people with chronic health conditions, especially chronic pain, to reduce their symptoms and restore the quality of their lives. THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE In this book, we will help you change your feelings of hopelessness and helplessness into realistic hope and empowerment. If your doctors have thrown up their hands and said that your case is \"hopeless\" or \"treatment resistant,\" we hope to help you prove them wrong. Most important, we will help you begin to really live again! Why Not Seek More Medical Treatment Now? When you stand in line at supermarkets and see the headlines of tabloid papers announcing new cures for arthritis, cancer, and other pain-inducing diseases, it is hard to turn away. But when you then consider these claims in the context of the tabloid also announcing new sightings of Elvis, alien abductions, and ways to lose 25 pounds in 5 days (with no effort, of course), you may reconsider. However, when you see mainstream newspapers describing transplants of all kinds of complex organs and new heart disease surgeries, you may more reasonably think, \"Surely there must be a new treatment for my pain. Perhaps I should see the doctor again.\" This is understandable. We all want to believe that when we have a problem in our lives, there is someone out there who can fix it. No one suggests that there is no hope for your car when, after you have taken it in to the mechanic, it has problems again. People tell you to take the car back to the mechanic or get a new mechanic. They never suggest that the problem is \"all in your head\" or is somehow your fault, as some people do when they hear you suffer from chronic pain. So why shouldn\\'t you look to a different doctor, or perhaps undertake a different surgery, or try a new drug? It is always good to get a second opinion when you have chronic pain. However, if you have seen more than two doctors who are up-to-date on recent medical advances in pain, going to a third or fourth doctor is likely to cause more frustration and feelings of hopelessness. We are not suggesting that there may never be a way to reduce your pain by newly discovered drugs or surgical treatment. Over the last decade, there have been many advances in medicine for some pain conditions. However, despite these developments, there is currently no treatment that can eliminate all pain for all people all of the time. Even the most powerful treatments (namely, opioid drugs, anticonvulsant and antidepressant medications, and surgery) typically reduce pain by no more than 40%. Only rarely is pain eliminated by currently available treatments. There may be breakthroughs tomorrow, but right now it makes more sense to become your own pain expert and begin to manage your pain and your life. When Friends and Family Don\\'t Help When you have chronic pain, you may get the feeling that not only your doctor but even your closest family and friends do not realize what it feels like to have chronic pain 24 hours Introduction a day, 365 days a year or to experience frequent devastating acute pain at unpredictable times. Unlike when you have the flu and people can see your symptoms, pain is maddeningly invisible to anyone else but the sufferer. There is simply no pain thermometer that you can show to someone to prove that you are ill. Some family members or friends may subtly (or not so subtly) insinuate that you are exaggerating the extent and depth of your pain or your pain-induced limitations. The truly uninformed may suspect that you just want to gain attention, elicit sympathy, avoid responsibilities, or receive disability payments. Such responses can elicit feelings of undeserved shame. And, they definitely add to feelings of frustration, anger, and depression. It is helpful to know that everyone feels bad when his or her concerns are not taken seriously. So What Should You Do Now? Do you remember the Peanuts cartoon strip in which Charlie Brown is standing on the baseball mound talking to Lucy? He wonders if he should play baseball that day as his arm hurts, his stomach hurts, and his back hurts. Lucy advises, \"Play anyway! Don\\'t let your body push you around!\" As you will see later in this book, it is not always wise to \"play anyway\" (although it is always wise to play!). But Lucy\\'s other point is totally in line with our thinking. We will not provide a miracle \"cure,\" but we will help you learn how \"not to let your body push you around.\" We will be your coaches, and we will help you enlist people in your life to be on your team. This will ensure that you, not your pain, are in charge of your life. Perhaps even those people whose remarks elicited feelings of shame or anger in the past will be on your team once they see that you take your pain seriously enough to make managing it your first priority. Perhaps when they see the efforts you are making, they will finally realize that your pain is real, after all. And, even if they don\\'t, you will feel better. You will take up some of your favorite activities again. And you will feel realistic hope, perhaps for the first time in years. Are we exaggerating? You will be the ultimate judge of that. But we promise that we are offering you a clinically proven program that has been used successfully with thousands of people just like you. A great deal of research evidence exists to support our confidence in our approach to a wide variety of pain problemsback pain, fibromyalgia, chronic headache, arthritis, and many more. (At the end of the book we have included a representative list of published studies on which we based our program, should you be interested in the scientific findings behind each of our lessons.) There are two things we must tell you, however. First, our program comes with a warning label. As with instructions on labels of antibiotic drugs, you must \"take all the treatment in the book (bottle)\" to reap the full benefits. THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Second, this program is relatively simple. But, simple does not necessarily mean easy. We know of no \"easy\" way to manage chronic pain. It just does not exist. You will need to make pain management an important priority in your life. Worked consistently, these lessons can help you thrive. An Overview of Our Program This program consists of ten related lessons. Each has a specific focus, but all are designed to help you gain control of your pain and your life. In fact, if these lessons are put into practice consistently, they can help you thrive! In lesson 1, you will learn about pain in general, about the enormous number of people who suffer from pain, and about the incapacitating effects of chronic pain. You will learn that you are not alone. For example, surveys have shown that up to one third of the population of the United States has some form of chronic or recurring pain problem. Most important, you will also learn some of the erroneous and harmful myths about pain. Believing these myths as if they were facts will interfere with your ability to gain control over your pain. Knowledge is the true beginning of power. In lesson 2, you will learn to recognize the first important pain reducer: optimal activity, rest, and pacing. Rather than remaining immobile or pushing yourself too hard, you will learn how to find a proper balance between exertion and rest. You will learn the importance of pacing your activities to prevent increased pain while still being able to enjoy being active. Practicing will enable you to gradually increase your energy, activities, and conditioning without harming yourself or making your pain worse. In lesson 3, you will learn to recognize the value of the second key pain reducer relaxation. This relaxation is not the kind in which you put your feet up and watch television in a haze. You\\'re probably bored with that by now anyway, even if you may want to deny this at times. Instead, you will learn how you can create deep relaxation, beneficial rest, and hence enjoy many activities that you may not have considered before. In lesson 4, we discuss the problems of chronic tiredness and disturbed sleep that many of our patients experience. We share with you our best knowledge of how to defeat chronic fatigue and achieve a good night\\'s rest. As you consistently practice lessons 2, 3, and 4, you will notice a reduction in your experience of pain, and passively watching television will be even more boring! Up to this point, you\\'ve been working alone with us, your coaches. In lesson 5, you will learn how you can include other people in your life as teammates. We teach you to communicate with others in your life in such a way that they will support and encourage you. If they are stubborn, we help you to find new people who can provide understanding and support and help you make the most of this program. You may not need a whole baseball team, but Introduction you do need at least one or two people to cheer you on. Even if you consider yourself a loner, you should know that understanding, acceptance, and support are proved pain reducers. In lesson 6, we focus on changing behavior (your own especially) by learning about the laws of learning. We will teach you a number of principles with which you can influence your own behavior and (sometimes) that of others (and vice versa). You will learn how the behaviors and responses of others affect you, even without your being aware of this. You will also learn how to change certain aspects of your lifestyle that contribute to (note that we do not say cause) or worsen your pain. In lesson 7, we focus on how you think and feel when you experience pain. We know you are not creating your pain by your thoughts and emotional reactions. But you can help control your pain by changing how you think about and react to it. You will learn how you can influence and control your mental and emotional responses to the very real pain you are experiencing. You will be able to direct your thoughts and feelings so that they contribute to your sense of control rather than to feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. In lesson 8, you will learn to regain self-confidence and to trust yourself again. With regard to trust, this may seem odd. We usually think of trust as having to do with other people. However, people with chronic pain often lose trust in their bodies and hence themselves. If others are not supportive (and we include some health care practitioners here), you may lose trust in others as well. Trust, especially in yourself, and self-confidence are potent factors in managing pain. You will learn coping skills and problem-solving strategies to regain self-trust and self-confidence. These will allow you to further control your pain. In lesson 9, you will learn more about the relation between your pain and how your daily habits may be influence your perception of pain. You will also learn how your past experiences affect your relationship with pain now. You will learn to identify and change more things in your life that are contributing to the negative effects of your pain. If you have reached lesson 10 and worked each lesson diligently, you will be much happier and will have taken on many activities you never thought you would do again. However, it is just as important to learn to maintain these gains. In lesson 10, we help you continue your self-management program, manage setbacks and relapses, and maintain the benefits you have achieved. As you learn that you can bounce back, you will be even more likely to confront and seek out new challenges. You will learn how to stay motivated for life! We strongly encourage you to keep some kind of diary or journal as you work through the lessons in this program. At the end of each lesson, we have included a set of questions for you to consider or exercises for you to complete. We have designed each \"homework assignment\" exercise to help you learn specific skills and ways to control your pain. You don\\'t have to do all of them. We will indicate which questions and activities are critical by putting them in boldface type. However, we encourage you to at least try one or two others as well. Perhaps you can pick the one that appeals most to you. Some of our patients, however, have gained the most from choosing the one question or exercise that they least THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE wanted to answer or do. Participating in this way will help you relate the information in the lesson to your own unique circumstances. Most important are our suggestions for keeping track of your progress. The charts we introduce in lessons 2 and 3 should be photocopied and kept in your journal or in a notebook on an ongoing basis. These records are critical because improvements can be so gradual that you may not know you are improving unless you have a record to look back on. Also, you may have heard that keeping a food diary has been shown to be a if not the critical component in most weight-reduction programs. The same is true for reducing pain; keeping track of your efforts can help you get on track and stay on track over the long haul. At the end of the book we also include a list of suggested additional reading, organized by lesson. These readings are optional, but they may help you when your motivation is lagging. Most of the books listed can be obtained from libraries or bookstores in your community or through the Internet. A Note of Encouragement Before Beginning One of the many people who has consistently followed our program was asked what her biggest achievement was. She said, Before the program, I got up with the thought, \"Heavens, another long, painful day. I wish it were evening again.\" In the evening in bed I thought, \"Heavens, another long, painful night, I wish it were morning again. In my darkest hours I even thought that perhaps it would be better if I did not see the morning again.\" I knew that this was not living. I didn\\'t want to grow old like this. After consistently following this program, I now sleep reasonably well, enjoy friends, family, and activities, and when I wake up, I look forward to the new day. Another of our patients said, The desire to continue living and being able to feel a considerable degree of control over pain is the greatest achievement of my life, outside of raising my children. Men, who often say similar things in fewer words, also have encouragement to share. As one patient said, I\\'m a new man now; I\\'ve regained my life. If you are ready to live again, let\\'s get started. L E S S O N 1 Becoming Your Own Pain Management Expert \"Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to know the difference.\" Serenity Prayer, Rheinhold Neibuhr reryone has pain at times. The reassuring thing about most pain is that it will usually jo away with time. A sports injury and its resulting pain, such as an elbow injured during a casual game of tennis, will eventually heal with resting that part of the arm. Once the pain has ceased for the weekend tennis player, the suffering is soon forgotten. For most people, it is unthinkable that pain will never go away. That is part of why they don\\'t understand the plight of those who experience chronic pain. Even those with chronic pain don\\'t like to think of it as such. If we admit to having chronic pain, it means admitting it will last a long time or perhaps will never go away at all. It\\'s scary to think that way, and such thinking can also make the pain seem even worse. If doctors have been stymied and called your pain \"treatment-resistant\" or \"chronic,\" you may have asked yourself, \"Have the doctors been defeated by my pain? \"Have they given up on me?\" Am I condemned to a life of inactivity, anger, helplessness, suffering, and despair?\" These are normal but very depressing thoughts! The good news is that many thousands of people have proved that despite the presence of pain, they do not have to give in and give up control of their lives. They have found a middle ground. They are not denying that their pain is chronic, but they are also stepping up to the plate and confronting their pain. They have found a balance between acceptance and change. The Serenity Prayer with which we began this lesson seems particularly applicable, especially the words serenity, courage, and most important, wisdom. Our patients begin to no longer think of themselves as patients but rather as pain selfmanagers. They have gradually learned what they are capable of doing, and they have done that and gained even more capability. Although once pain held them completely in its grip, 10 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE they have found ways to overcome its debilitating effects. They have become smarter, more clever, and wiser. They have gained control over their pain and their lives. As you work through this book, it will become clear to you that while others can support you, you must become your own expert on your pain and your own pain manager. In the coming lessons, we will coach you to become that expert. You already know more than you think. Nobody knows your pain as well as you do, not even the finest doctors in the world. Nor does your neighbor with a similar ailment know your pain as well as you know it, because pain is an incredibly personal experience. It is your personal expertise in pain that will be our basis in coaching you. It will help us to help you design a plan to manage your pain, which is as unique as you are. In this lesson, you will learn more about pain so that you can better understand your own. Knowledge is power! The Nature of Chronic Pain We have used the phrase chronic pain several times already in this book, but what exactly defines pain as chronic? Usually, pain following overuse or injury is considered to be chronic when it continues to interfere with living or does not become much less intense after the expected period of healing (i.e., medical estimates as to how long it takes for tissue damage to heal following an injury or overuse). Pain is also considered chronic when it is related to a progressive disease (such as arthritis or cancer). For most acute injuries, such as as a sprained ankle, the expected period of healing is from several weeks to several months. For back injuries, the pain may last longer, but with proper care should remit over a period of time. For pain following minor surgery, the expected period of healing might only be a few days. Thus, there is no exact time at which pain ceases to be acute and becomes chronic. But most of us know when we have a chronic disease such as arthritis. We also tend to know when pain from an injury has persisted well beyond the expected course. And, we can all agree that pain has become chronic when it alters our lifestyle and serves no useful purpose (more about the purpose of pain later in this lesson). Chronic Pain Is Very CommonAll Too Common! When we have chronic pain, it is easy to feel as if we are alone. The reality is, however, that chronic pain is unfortunately very common. Recent surveys provide some rather surprising, and to many distressing, information (see Exhibit 1.1). Becoming Your Own Expert 11 Exhibit 1.1. The Magnitude of the Problem In the United States alone, + over 11 million people experience migraine headaches; ^ 23 million people report the presence of chronic back pain; + 37 million people indicate they have pain associated with arthritis; + 3 to 6 million people are diagnosed with fibromyalgia; + 3.5 million people experience pain associated with cancer and its treatment; + annual costs (health care, disability, lost productivity) of chronic pain may exceed $125 billion this year. Although pain is a personal experience, you have a lot of company when it comes to experiencing chronic pain. Of course, knowing that such large numbers of others experience chronic pain does not diminish your suffering. But at least there is some solace in knowing that you are not alone. And there is even more solace in knowing that many of these people have learned to live fulfilling lives despite their pain. You can too! The Usefulness of Pain Acute pain can be useful as a warning that you have gone beyond your body\\'s limitations, but the pain signaling system is unreliable at times. Often, harm is occurring within the body and no pain is experienced. Even more often, harm cannot be detected with classic medical tests, but pain is clearly present. Harm, but No Pain Often, people with cancer feel quite healthy until their disease progresses into a very serious condition. A lump that is not noticeable to anyone but a well-trained physician can be discovered during a routine medical check up and turn out to be malignant. The patient in question may feel no pain at all, and yet something life-threatening is occurring in his or her body. Following successful surgery or chemotherapy, he or she may still experience pain or other kinds of discomfort, but the pain is not caused by the tumor but by the treatment itself. Likewise, there are a substantial number of people who do not report pain, but when diagnostic tests like x-rays are performed, significant pathology is present. In fact, studies 12 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE have shown that when sophisticated diagnostic procedures (such as magnetic resonance images [MRIs], and computed axial tomography [CAT scans]), are performed, as many as 35% of people who have no reported symptoms and no pain at all, show significant physical pathology. This is pathology that we might reasonably expect to cause pain! Contrary to what we might believe, there is not a close relationship between the amount of pain we feel and the amount of harm occurring in our bodies. That\\'s why it is important to have routine medical check ups! Pain, but No Objective Evidence There are many common chronic pain conditions such as back pain, whiplash (resulting from neck injuries frequently following motor vehicle accidents), fibromyalgia (a painful musculoskeletal condition characterized by widespread and persistent pain and fatigue), and migraine and tension headaches in which little evidence of physical pathology can be detected. For example, in up to 85% of people with back pain, doctors are unable to determine a physical cause. Yet, such pain may be severe, causing significant distress and disability. In the case of chronic headaches, there is rarely any identifiable tissue damage that can explain the experience of pain, yet these people suffer enormously. In whiplash injuries and fibromyalgia, no physical cause can be identified in a substantial majority of the people who report that their pain is severe and greatly diminishes the quality of their lives. Some people for whom medical tests do not show a cause for their pain may be told outright that their pain is not real. Or, more often, they receive subtle signals from doctors, family members, or insurance claims managers that they are exaggerating normal aches and pains. You may have experienced such skepticism yourself. We do not agree with such messages. All pain is real to the person who experiences it! Same Injury, Same Treatment, Different Results Another puzzling aspect of pain is the fact that people with the same medical diagnosis (either injury or disease) often respond quite differently to identical treatments. For example, three people may have surgery for a problem that is apparently caused by a dysfunction of a spinal disc (such discs function as \"shock absorbers\" in the body). Following surgery, one patient is very happy because the pain is gone. Another is disappointed and surprised to find the pain feels the same. A third person is very distressed because the pain feels even worse than before the surgery. These are common experiences for people who have undergone disc surgery. The results suggest that factors other than damage to the disc, bones, nerves, and muscles associated with the spine must be contributing to the pain experienced after surgery. Becoming Your Own Expert 13 Misleading Pain There are also a number of pain disorders in which the pain system gives a misleading signal. You feel pain in one place, but the damage is someplace else. Doctors call this \"referred\" pain. The pain at one place in the body refers to damage somewhere else in the body. For example, pain on the side of the biceps in the arm may indicate a frozen shoulder syndrome. Back pain may be caused by problems in the stomach or pelvis. Finally, there are \"strange\" pain experiences that occur following amputation or after damage to the spinal cord. Quite commonly, pain is felt as ifit were in the amputated limb a limb that is no longer attached to a body! This is referred to as phantom-limb pain. However, whereas the limb may be phantom, the pain certainly is not! Pain is also frequently felt in the lower limbs of people who have had a spinal cord injury and are paralyzed. Some of these individuals experience real pain in their legs although they cannot move them. This pain is counterintuitive, because through damage to the spinal cord, the nerve pathways linking the spinal cord to the brain are completely severed. Theoretically, no messages signaling injury can travel along the nerves to ever reach the brain. Thus, there should be no pain signals registering in the brain and therefore, there should be no pain. Yet, a significant proportion of people with spinal cord injuries do, in fact, feel severe pain. How can this be? It is as if the plug has been pulled from the radio but the music is still playing. Pain is indeed one of the most mysterious of physical maladies. Take Your Pain Seriously Extreme pain is real, even if there is no \"objective\" (i.e., observable) cause for it as defined by current medical diagnostic techniques. The same is true for depression, for example. A person can be depressed or suicidal when his or her whole life is going well, and nothing will show up on any medical test. And this has been true for decades. The Russian author Tolstoy once wrote, \"I am very rich and famous; millions of Russians read my books. I possess a big farm, a wife and five children and the only thought that haunts me is: shall I use a rope or a gun to end it all?\" Many people with chronic pain become depressed. They have to take that seriously as well as their pain and consult a mental health professional when these feelings interfere with their quality of life. The same is true with anxiety. A person in no objective danger can break out in a sweat and feel as if he or she is going to die. That is why it is good to once again repeat that feelings of fear, sadness, and pain can be extremely intense, even if they seem out of proportion to the so-called objective facts. When chastising themselves for having pain and thinking of themselves as weak, individuals with anxiety or depression often think they are \"going crazy.\" 14 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Neither the pain sufferer nor the person suffering from anxiety or depression is weak or crazy. What they have in common is that they must search for a solution rather than focusing on what may or may not be the cause. Seek the Solution, Not the Cause In cases of chronic pain, both the sufferer and the doctor initially seek to find the cause of the pain. By this, doctors usually mean the physical cause. Long after a second opinion has been sought and the doctor has \"given up,\" the patient may continue to try to find the cause of the pain. However, the main question is not, How or why did I get the pain? The critical question is, What can I do to manage my pain so that I can get on with my life? We will discuss the role of factors other than physical damage in pain later in this book. Here, we discuss some of them briefly in the context of Gate Control Theory. The Gate Control Theory Imagine a door or gate in your spinal cord. Before your pain became chronic or before you had a progressive disease such as arthritis, usually this gate was closed and you did not feel pain. If you had an injury or some other type of obvious physical damage occurred, signals were sent along your nerves (the wiring of our bodies) to the spinal cord. These signals opened the gate and allowed information about the injury or damage to your body to reach the brain. This is where these signals are interpreted, with the result being the feeling of pain. In these cases, as you healed sometimes the pain was better and sometimes it was worse. It depended on how far open or closed the gate was. In Exhibit 1.2 we have included a summary of the different factors that are known to open and close the pain gate. The idea of a pain gate that can be opened and closed will help you understand that pain, especially chronic pain, cannot simply be eliminated by cutting out a painful body part or cutting nerves. In the past, nerves were cut in the hope of blocking pain. Unfortunately, all too often the surgical procedures created more problems than they solved. The nervous system does not operate like a simple cable system that can just be clipped and repaired. It is a living system that is continually changing and adapting to new circumstances and new information. In addition to this information, it\\'s helpful to know about common folklore about pain that can actually decrease your chances of living a zestful life. A couple of these ideas we Becoming Your Own Expert 15 Exhibit 1.2. Summary of the Factors That Can Open and Close the Pain Gate Factors that can open the pain gate O Physical factors ft Extent of injury ft Inappropriate activity level O Emotional stress ft Depression ft Worry/fear ft Tension ft Anger O Thoughts fl Focusing on the pain ft Boredom due to minimal involvement in life activities ft Nonadaptive attitudes and expectations (\"It will never end!\" \"I\\'m helpless and hopeless!\") Factors that can close the pain gate O Physical factors II Medication II Counterstimulation (heat, rubbing) II Appropriate activity level II Rest O Relative emotional stability II Relaxation II Positive emotions (happiness, optimism) O Thoughts II Life involvement, increased interest in life activities II Concentration/distractionII Adaptive attitudes/positive thoughts and feelings (\"I can control my feelings.\" \"I can reduce my level of muscle tension.\" \"I am capable of doing many things despite my pain.\") 16 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE have already briefly discussed, but the information is so important to your recovery that it bears repeating. Common Myths About Pain Myth 1: Pain is ALWAYS a reliable signal of physical damage and injury. Pain may be a clear and reliable signal of damage to the body. When this occurs, pain is useful; it has a purpose, namely, protection. Pain makes it clear to you when the water in a bath is too hot; this information can prevent you from burning yourself. Such pain makes you feel uncomfortable when you are trying on shoes and they are too tight. The pain tells you not to buy them! However, as discussed earlier, pain is not always a reliable indicator of where and to what extent harm is occurring in the body. Most important, pain, in the form of discomfort on exertion, is not necessarily an indicator for action or inaction when it comes to chronic pain. We will talk more about this important topic in the next lesson. Myth 2: When no clear physical damage is found by diagnostic procedures, pain must be imaginary. If this were true, millions of people with back pain, headache, phantom-limb pain, and pain following spinal cord injuries would all be suffering from imaginary pain! An epidemic of imaginary pain is not very likely. For too long, only when a direct relationship could be found between pain and visible damage was pain taken seriously. The absence of identifiable physical pathology does not negate pain and suffering, nor does it guarantee that no physical factors may be contributing to the pain. As noted earlier, all pain is real, regardless of what anyone else has told you. Myth 3: Chronic pain that does not respond to standard treatment should not be taken seriously. Lack of knowledge and ignorance about chronic pain have caused great physical and emotional distress (anxiety, depression, frustration, anger) for many people. Too many individuals still believe that \"You can only have pain and feel pain when your pain has been legitimized by a physician.\" This implies that only a doctor can determine whether you have a right to your feelings of pain. No one has a right to tell you what you are feeling, no matter how many academic degrees he or she may have. Unfortunately, pain is not directly observable. It is an intensely personal experience. There is, as yet, no pain thermometer that measures the internal experience of pain. Only you know how much pain you feel and how often you feel it. Myth 4: There is a pill for every ill. When in doubt, cut it out. People, particularly those in the United States, have been flooded with advertisements suggesting that there should be a \"pill\" for every problem. The print and television media reinforce this: Can\\'t sleep at night? Take a pill. Don\\'t have enough energy? Take a pill. Feel upset? Take a pill. Prevent indigestion before eating a spicy meal. Take a pill. Becoming Your Own Expert 17 Now, surgery too is being recommended like never before. If you don\\'t like the way your face or body looks, have surgery. Think you look too fat? Have liposuction. Don\\'t like your lips? Have collagen injections. Breasts too small or too large? Implants and breast reduction surgery to the rescue! Even people with well-earned wrinkles are advised to have Botox treatments. Depending on pills and surgery sounds so much better than learning what it takes to change your behavior or your mindset. We are not saying that medication and surgery are never appropriate. There is a time and place for medication and surgery. But the mass media are not qualified to make these decisions. Don\\'t be brainwashed by their messages. When it comes to pain, be informed. For example, every month there seems to be a new arthritis pill advertised on television. Some of these are just a variation on a medication for which the patent has just expired. What these advertisements don\\'t tell you is that even the most potent pain medications produce only about a 35% reduction of pain and in only about one-half of the people who take them! And taking medication definitely does not ensure long-term improvements in quality of life. Myth 5: Pain is a signal to stop moving. In instances of pain following an acute injury or trauma (e.g., a broken leg as a result of a fall from a ladder), it may be appropriate to desist from activities that increase pain. In these cases, the pain is serving as a reliable warning signal. Remember the joke about the man who goes to a doctor and says, \"Doc, it hurts when I do this.\" The doctor replies \"Don\\'t do that!\" However, for people with chronic pain, feeling pain or discomfort with exertion is not a reliable signal to cease activity. In fact, some forms of inactivity increase pain in chronic pain patients (more about this later). Consider that even following heart surgery, doctors recommend certain activities because being active tends to speed recoveryalthough it hurts at first! For those with chronic pain, discomfort following reasonable activities may have little to do with the original cause of the pain and more to do with reduction in strength, endurance, and flexibility of muscles due to lack of use. In the next lesson, we will describe guidelines for how to increase activity to eventually decrease pain. But for now keep in mind that not moving may be increasing your pain and disability over time. Myth 6: If you have had pain for a long time and doctors have told you that they have \"done all they can,\" your situation is hopeless. This is perhaps the most dangerous myth we have described. It undermines your efforts to gain control over your pain and your life. As this book will show, everyone can make changes that lead to pain reduction and improved quality of life. Treatments for Pain Many of you know the most common medical treatments for pain. However, you may benefit from reading this section, as you may be unaware of some of the new developments, such 18 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE as the use of antidepressants for pain. During the period since this book was published, new drugs, surgical procedures, and complimentary modalities and techniques may have become available that can be added to this list and others that can be removed. Perhaps the most common treatment for pain has been and continues to be medication. The issue with prescription and over-the-counter medications for many people is that, like any drug, they can cause side effects that are unpleasant. These include dizziness, constipation, and problems with concentration. Some side effects can even be dangerous. Many times, side effects are experienced soon after you begin taking medication. Your physician should monitor side effects carefully, and you should let him or her know about any adverse reactions that you experience. Long-term use of any medication can cause side effects later in the course of treatment. If you have been taking prescribed medication for a while and begin to experience new symptoms, discuss these with your physician. If you are considering stopping medication at any point, be sure to discuss this with your physician as well. With long-term use of medication, your body may become physically dependent on the drug. Your physician will know how to increase, taper, or stop the medication, and can tell you what you may initially experience as your body adjusts to the change. Changing medication should be always be done under the supervision of a physician. Analgesic Medication There are two primary classes of \"pain killing\" medications (analgesics): ^ Nonnarcotic/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories: Many pain-alleviating treatments in this class can be purchased without a prescription (e.g., aspirin, Advil, Aleve, Bufferin, Motrin, Tylenol). Others require a prescription (e.g., Celebrex). These drugs tend to target the peripheral nervous system. + Narcotic (opioids). These potent short-acting (e.g., codeine, Dilaudid, Vicodin, Lortab, Percodan, Percocet) and long-acting (e.g., methadone, Oxycontin, Duragesic) drugs require prescription by a physician. These drugs target the central nervous system (i.e., brain and spinal cord). Antidepressants Antidepressants are sometimes effective in relieving pain directly, perhaps due to their effects on serotonin and norepinephrine (neurotransmitters). Antidepressants may also help improve sleep. Therefore, they may be used for pain relief even in the absence of depression. Sometimes Becoming Your Own Expert 19 antidepressants are prescribed if the emotions accompanying pain interfere with the ability to function and the quality of one\\'s own life. Some antidepressants help with anxiety and are less likely than anti-anxiety medications to cause physical dependency when used over an extended period of time. Whether to reduce pain directly or to help cope with the effects of having a chronic illness, your physician may have prescribed any of the class of drugs labeled antidepressants (e.g., amitriptyline-Elavil, doxepin-Sinequan; imipramine-Tofranil; trazodone- Desyrel; Prozac, Zoloft). The long-term effects of some of the newest antidepressants are unknown (usually these are the newest selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors [SSNRJ] such as venlafaxine-Effexor and duloxetine-Cymbalta), because they have not been on the market long enough for long-term effects to be studied. Antidepressant medications usually cause few problems, although they too can cause side effects for some people. If you experience side effects that don\\'t remit after a period of a month or so, or if your side effects are serious (e.g., more than dry mouth or drowsiness, or other minor side effects your doctor should tell you about), let him or her know immediately. In taking these medications, be aware that they usually take from 2 to 4 weeks before they have an effect. As with any drug, there can also be serious side effects. If you are prescribed an antidepressant and have found it not to be helpful over several months, you should discuss this with your physician and possibly discontinue or change the medication under his or her supervision. Mixed Agent Drugs There is one medication that does not exactly fit in any of the other categories that is frequently prescribed for paintramadol (Ultram). At high doses, tramadol has some of the properties of opioids. If you are taking this prescribed medication for your pain and have any problems, you should discuss this with your physician. Sedatives, Tranquilizers, and Muscle Relaxants Sedatives and minor tranquilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines)such as diazepam (Valium), lorazepam (Ativan), and clonazepam (Klonopin)and muscle relaxants (e.g., cyclobenzaprine-Flexeril, methocarbamol-Robaxin), may be prescribed to help people cope with anxiety and also to improve their sleep. These may be used in combination with analgesics. Sedatives and tranquilizers may help relieve short-term anxiety about pain. They also have more immediate effects than antidepressants. However, they are not appropriate for long-term use for people with chronic pain because of their definite potential for addiction 20 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE when used on a long-term basis (i.e., more than a few months). Again, if you are prescribed any of these medications and have found them not to be helpful after several weeks, you should discuss this with your physician and possibly discontinue or change the medication under his or her supervision. Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsant drugs formerly were used only when people had seizures. Now, some anticonvulsants such as gabapentrin (Neurontin) or topimax (Trileptal) have been shown to have a beneficial effect on pain associated with nerve injuries for some people (e.g., those with diabetic neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, postherpetic neuralgia). The long-term effects of these new anticonvulsants are unknown, because they have not been on the market long enough for such effects to be studied. If you are prescribed any of these medications and have found them not to be helpful in a month or so, you should discuss this with your physician and possibly discontinue or change the medication under supervision. Topical Agents Several topical agents, such as (Zostrix) and 5% lidocaine patch (Lidoderm) have been shown to reduce the severity of pain in some conditions related to nerve damage. If you are prescribed any of these medications and have found them not to be helpful after several weeks, you should discuss this with your physician and possibly discontinue or change the medication under supervision. Surgery Surgery is appropriate with certain kinds of pathology causing acute pain. There are a large variety of surgical approaches that can help, depending on the pathology that is believed to be the \"pain generator.\" However, when pain persists over long periods of time, surgery is less likely to be effective. Also, if you have already had one operation, it is unlikely that more surgery will eliminate the pain. A second operation may, however, be justified if the initial cause of your pain has progressed as part of a degenerative disease, or your physical condition has deteriorated. When surgery is being considered, you should discuss this with your primary physician and a qualified surgeon. Obtaining a second surgical opinion is recommended, because Becoming Your Own Expert 21 surgeons differ in their approach to surgery as well. A second opinion also has the benefit of helping you to judge which surgeon is more qualified to conduct the surgery. Because surgery has the potential for ill as well as good, do your homework and be well informed before you elect surgery or choose a surgeon. Nerve Blocks Local anesthetic agents (e.g., lidocaine) that are similar to Novocain may be injected into peripheral nerve fibers when the physician believes the pain is being generated, transferred, or referred. The most common form of this procedure is called an epidural block. Here, local anesthetic is injected between the vertebrae into spinal nerves. Many other nerves can also be \"blocked\" by injecting the anesthetic into them. Injection of steroids into the epidural space surrounding the spinal cord and nerves may be helpful in sciatica (leg pain secondary to disc disease). These injections will cause the nerve fibers to become numb (anesthetized). Specially trained physicians, usually anesthesiologists, are qualified to perform nerve blocks. Some people feel immediate reductions of pain following these injections. Others do not feel any relief. The duration of relief, when obtained, varies unpredictably from hours to days to weeks. However, the effects do not last indefinitely for anyone. Trigger Point Injections Trigger points are hypersensitive areas of muscles, ligaments, or tendons. They are known to lie above or near the point in the muscles where the motor nerves are located. Excessive activity in motor nerves can produce pain either at the site or at some other site (i.e., referred pain). There are standard patterns of referred pain associated with specific injuries. When these trigger points are pressed, this can cause a great deal of pain. Direct stress to the muscle, such as trauma (e.g., a muscle tear during a motor vehicle accident, a tendon inflamed during repetitive activity), chronic tension, abnormal posture, or prolonged muscle fatigue may result in pain in these trigger point areas. This is relevant to chronic pain, because some who experience chronic pain tend to tense their muscles in an attempt to brace (i.e., protect) them from pain. This, in turn, can lead to the pain-muscle spasm-pain circle. When in spasm, muscles tend to remain in a tense or contracted state, blood flow is decreased to the muscle, and posture can become abnormal. This may serve to maintain the pain or make it worse. Also, some trigger points may become inactive from sedentary living, which is unfortunately common in many chronic pain sufferers. Trigger-point pain can then be reactivated by minor stress from daily living, anxiety, overstretching, or sudden use, overuse, and fatigue of previously underworked muscles. 22 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Thermal Therapies Both heat and cold therapy can reduce muscle tension or spasm. Heat can reduce muscle contraction (spasm) caused by overfatigue of muscles. Applying heat to sore, fatigued muscles tends to open (i.e., dilate) blood vessels and thus increase oxygen flow and eliminate chemical irritants. Cold can also reduce muscle spasm and swelling from an injury or inflammation. (Note that many have found that frozen peas in a bag wrapped in a towel are more useful and convenient than ice packs. They can be \"molded\" around a painful body part such as the forearm. They can be refrozen and used over and over again [be sure not to eat them, afterwards, however]). Heat and cold have been found to be about equally effective and may be used separately or together (i.e., one following the other). They are useful home remedies that are also used during and after physical therapy sessions. Electrical and Ultrasound Stimulation Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is designed to stimulate nerves to counterstimulate pain signals (transcutaneous means \"through the skin\"). TENS transmits electrical impulses through wires to surface electrodes taped to the skin surrounding a painful area. The person who is using TENS will feel a tingling sensation that may mask pain signals. TENS may also stimulate the body\\'s own natural pain-reducing chemicals (endorphins Latin for \"internal opioids\"). Spinal cord stimulators may be surgically implanted with an external power source. This can be activated to provide an electrical current to nerves along the spinal cord. The electrical current blocks the transmission of signals along the spinal cord so that they do not reach the brain areas that make one aware of pain. Ultrasound, either with heat (in fatty areas) or without heat (in bony areas) has also been found to be useful, particularly in cases of acute injury leading to chronic pain. Chiropractic Manipulations In chiropractic theory, muscle and joint pain result from faulty relationships among bones and faulty alignment of the spine. So, chiropractors perform manipulationsoften quite strenuouslyto return the bones or spinal cord to \"proper\" alignment. Sometimes these are quite helpful, particularly in the early stages of an injury, such as whiplash. However, over a long period of time they may become less effective. Becoming Your Own Expert 23 Acupuncture Acupuncture is a method of pain and disease control discovered in China almost 5,000 years ago. In acupuncture theory, imaginary lines on the body (called \"medians\") represent internal organs and other parts of the body. Points on these lines are thought to connect different parts of the body. One or more of these points are stimulated by insertion of an acupuncture needle. When the needles are placed in the skin, the practitioner may gently twirl the needle by hand or by electrical current attached to the needles. Some needles are stimulated for brief periods of 10 to 20 minutes and then removed; others are left in for longer periods of time. The needles used are very thin and solid, and virtually no pain is felt when administered by a qualified practitioner. Currently, the U.S. National Institutes of Health are studying the effectiveness of this treatment for various conditions. As with any treatment, if you decide to have acupuncture, be sure to seek a qualified practitioner. Biofeedback Biofeedback is a means of bodily self-monitoring and can be used to help people learn to control certain physiological processes, such as heart rate and muscle tension. For example, under stress, skeletal muscles may contract, causing muscle tension. Biofeedback uses electrical sensors on skin over muscles to detect this rising tension. The electrical sensors are linked to the biofeedback machine, which provides audible or visual signals to the patient. These signals enable people to understand their physiological activities and to control them consciously and, over time, more automatically. With experience, people can determine what mental or physical adjustments produce the greatest reduction in tension. They may then use these exercises without the need of the biofeedback machine. Biofeedback has been used to treat headaches, facial pain (e.g., temporomandibular joint pain), back pain, and fibromyalgia, among other conditions. Pain Clinics and Rehabilitation Programs Specialized pain clinics and rehabilitation programs have been developed over the past 30 years to treat people with chronic pain. These programs usually use many of the techniques described above, most often in combination. In addition to including physicians on their staff, the best programs have psychologists specializing in pain reduction who can teach stress management and coping skills. They can also help people improve their communication with family members and health care professionals. The better clinics have physical and occupational 24 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE therapists on staff to help people learn new ways to improve their strength, endurance, and functioning while they perform household and on-the-job tasks. Comprehensive programs have been shown to be very effective for helping people with severe, long-standing pain problems. You should discuss the appropriateness of referral to a pain clinic with your primary care doctor. If your doctor is unfamiliar with such clinics, seek out a doctor who is familiar with them (but is not on their staff) and ask whether he or she thinks it is worth your while to try such a program. Regardless of whether you are taking medication, decide to have surgery, or use any other treatments, be aware that any treatment may reduce but rarely completely eliminates pain for those who experience chronic pain. Thus, the techniques and methods described in this book can be critical in combination with other pain treatments in improving the quality of your life and decreasing pain severity. Also, as mentioned before, some of the treatments just discussed that are useful for some can be completely ineffective for others. If this is your case, then following the lessons in this program is even more crucial. Anyone with chronic pain, regardless of the treatment being received, can be helped by following this program. The Purpose of This Program When you have chronic pain, life seems to have lost its purpose. Being advised that \"you must learn to live with your pain\" feels like a betrayal. It is only when you can give purpose and quality to your life that there is a chance you can not only live with the pain, but actually thrive, despite the pain. With this lesson, you have begun the journey toward a new life by becoming better informed about pain. With knowledge and, most important, application of this knowledge, you will find ways to manage your pain and enjoy your life again. In the next lesson, the application of knowledge begins. You will learn how to use one of the most important tools in managing your painpacing. This next lesson is so vitally important that without it, the remainder of the lessons will likely bring limited relief. But before ending this lesson, let\\'s recap the high points: ^ Contrary to what most people think, pain is not always a reliable signal. + You have a right to feel what you feel about your pain. Fear, sadness, frustration, and anger are common responses to feeling helpless about your pain. + The Gate Control Model of pain helps explain some of what is puzzling about pain. There is a pain gate that determines in part whether signals communicating pain reach the brain. Thoughts, feelings, and other factors can open or close the pain gate. In this book you will learn ways to help close the gate. Becoming Your Own Expert 25 ^ There are a number of other myths about chronic pain that can be harmful. If you have believed these myths in the past, try to let go of them. ^ Pain always has something meaningful to say, and for this reason, it should always be taken seriously. + Feelings such as fear, sadness, and anger that often accompany chronic pain can get out of control. Ignoring or denying that you experience these emotions do not help. Finally, we stress that it\\'s more important to look for the solution than the cause of your pain: + The question is not \"how did I get the pain?\" ^ The question is \"how do I manage the pain?\" ^ The question is not \"what is the cause of the pain?\" ^ The question is \"what factors influence the pain?\" ^ The question is not \"what can the medical profession do?\" ^ The question is \"what can I do?\" In answer to this last question, we have suggested that you learn to become your own pain management expert. You know your pain best, and you will be able to design the best pain management program for yourself. We will help you do that in the nine lessons that follow. The Importance of Action Remember, knowledge is power. That is why, in part, you are reading this book. But reading is not enough. You must put into action what you learn in each lesson. At the end of this lesson and in all of the following lessons, we raise important questions for you to consider and suggest activities that are critical for pain management. These critical \"homework assignments\" (i.e., suggested activities) are indicated in boldface type. We have at times suggested additional ones, and doing these can hasten your adjustment. At a minimum, do the critical activities. If you can, do at least one more activity, either the one that appeals to you most or the one that appeals to you least. If you are in a good mood, we suggest that you do the one that appeals to you least. For some reason, these avoided activities can sometimes help the most. Because most people have negative associations to the word \"homework,\" we will call them activities that can help. 26 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Activities That Can Help To begin, we suggest four activities. Two of these are most important: They involve documenting and rating your recent pain. These are critical because they begin to put on paper a beginning knowledge of your pain that you can build on as you work through this book. Later, as you work through the book, answering these questions can help in reviewing your progress. The other two activities are optional but will definitely help you to become your own pain expert! Critical Activities 1. Rating your recent pain level. We suggest that you photocopy the Pain Rating System for use now, in the middle of the program, and at the end of the program. You may want to make extra copies for the maintenance phase as well. If you don\\'t have access to a copy machine, use the instructions in parentheses to mark your answers in your notebook or journal. In considering the ratings, think of each on a continuum. For example, with regard to rating pain, (0) means that you do not feel even a hint of discomfort. Very intense pain (6) means that you can barely move without feeling you may pass out from the pain. In the middle (25), you are aware of varying degrees of pain. As another example, if you were rating \"days,\" when you are experiencing a (1) level, you are having a really \"good\" day. When you are experiencing a (6) level, you are likely having a really \"bad\" day. In the middle (2-5), you are having a kind of \"middle good\" or \"middle bad\" day. Becoming Your Own Expert 27 PAIN RATING SYSTEM 1. Rate the level of your pain at the PRESENT MOMENT: (Date and record your answer in your journal [i.e., date, intensity].) 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 No pain Very intense pain 2.

Toward the middle and at the end of the program, you will be able to see how much progress you have made. So, please do your best to respond to each question. However, we ask that you not look back at these ratings until we ask you to do so. 2. Functional pain history A. Below is a list of activities.

Recent pain memories. In your journal or notebook, answer all of the following questions: A. Can you remember any day or time when your pain was most intense? In general, what times of day do you feel your pain most? B. Were there any activities that tended to increase your pain? What were they? C. Were there any stressors that tended to go along with increased pain? What were they? D. How did you feel emotionally? E. What were you were thinking at the time? F. What kinds of behaviors or interactions with others followed the \"increased\" or intense pain episodes? 4. Describe your pain history as if you were talking to a trusted friend (write this out in your notebook or journal). How long have you had the pain? Where is it located? How has it changed over time? How has the pain affected your work, play, and enjoyment of life? How has the pain affected your relationships with family and friends? L E S S O N 2 Activity, Rest, and Pacing Remind me each day That the race is not always to the swift; That there is more to life than increasing its speed. Let me look upward into the towering oak And know that it grew great and strong Because it grew slowly and well. Orin L. Grain One of the most frustrating things about pain is that it interferes with your ability to do the things that you want to do. All of the roles you playparent, partner, breadwinner, friend, neighbor, employee, artist, crafter, gardener, or volunteermay have been affected. You may feel that you are on the sidelines of life or that life is passing you by. You may also feel that you are a burden on others when you can\\'t do what you used to do or have to ask for help. You always wanted a meaningful and purposeful life. Now, in your darkest moments, you may wonder if you want a life at all. On better days, you ask yourself \"How can I get rid of the pain so that I can get on with my life?\" But you feel stuck. You may believe that you have tried everything. You may have actually tried everything doctors have suggested. So, you think to yourself, \"I have done what the doctors and other specialists have told me. Why am I still in such pain?\" Or, you may have gotten contradictory advice and don\\'t know which advice to heed. One health care professional may have suggested, \"You should take things more easily, you are doing too much.\" Another, however, suggests, \"You should keep moving, you aren\\'t doing enough.\" And then there are well-meaning friends and family. You spouse may have told you, \"You should persevere, you shouldn\\'t allow yourself to be controlled by the pain.\" Then, a friend tells you, \"You should listen to your body.\" Not much later, your son calls long distance and tells you, \"Don\\'t go by how you feel, push through it.\" Whose advice are you supposed to follow? If the advice of others has stymied you, you are not alone. What you really need to do is experiment with your body and become your own expert on what and how much activity 32 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE really helps. In this lesson, we will help you learn to do that. You will learn to differentiate between the sense and nonsense that others may have suggested. Knowing what to do about chronic pain is difficult because of its confusing nature. If you have gone to a yoga class or stretching class for \"normal\" people, the teacher may wisely tell the class, \"if you feel pain when you do any of the poses, stop.\" However, with chronic pain, pain cannot be your only guide with regard to most activities. Chronic pain may always be present, as you know, but you may have also noticed that it varies in intensity or comes and goes in an unpredictable manner. We will help you learn to deal with this variability and find out what level and type of activity will be most successful for you. You will also learn about the importance of pacing, and that despite some temporary discomfort, you can become active in ways that increase your energy and improve your conditioning. As you go along, it will become clearer to you how you can regain a level of daily functioning you thought you\\'d never reach. You may even become more able to do some things than you ever were. You will learn not only what you can do but also how you can do it better, longer, more efficiently, and without harming yourself or increasing your pain. Yes, we are talking in part about exercise, but don\\'t skip to the next lesson or close the book. If the word \"exercise\" has always turned you off, think of it as movement. As the saying goes . . . Move It or Lose It! How long have you experienced pain? Months, years, decades? Have you tried to prevent pain or at least decrease it by doing less? If so, you may have temporarily reduced your pain, but you may not know the cost of this short-term remedy. By moving less, you have reduced strength in your muscles. This is because lack of movement immobilizes your muscles, weakens them, and over time increases disability. Over a few months of decreased movement, more activities will become difficult and will begin to cause pain. This additional pain is likely not related to the original cause of pain but to weakened muscles (see Figure 2.1). This may not make sense to you now. You have learned through experience that certain movements will increase your pain. So, you stop doing them. This appears to be a rational strategy. You know that rest is a necessary condition for healing and recovery. So, you rest. Again, this appears to be a rational strategy. Well, in one sense it is. In cases of acute pain following an obvious injury, a brief period of rest (several days at most) in the form of inactivity may be useful. But even in these cases, inactivity for more than a week will lead to weakened muscles and increased disability. Activity, Rest, and Pacing 33 Pain Reduction of fitness Reduced mobility Figure 2.1. Pain leads to reduced mobility, which leads to reduced fitness. For example, have you ever had a broken arm or leg, or do you know someone who has? Well, if you have, you know that after resetting the bone, a cast is usually placed on the limb to keep it from moving in ways that will increase the injury. This lets the broken bone heal. However, this necessary remedy not only keeps the bone from moving. It also keeps related muscles immobile. When the cast is removed, usually in about 6 weeks, the limb has changed. Comparing that arm or leg with the other that was not injured is clear proof that inactivity causes muscle loss and muscle loss can increase pain. Studies have shown that we lose 20% of muscle mass, and hence strength, each week that we fail to make use of our muscles! And, if you do not use your muscles there will be a reduction not only in muscle strength but also in flexibility and endurance. You may be leery of where we seem to be headed. Instead of resting, you may have done the opposite at timespushed yourself hard, following the Nike command to \"Just do it!\" But then you have felt much worse for days after. Try to suspend judgment for a time, however, when it comes to this lesson. Try to trust that we\\'re not headed in that direction at all. Now, being open-minded, you are considering that maybe rest is not always best for healing, and at times it can make things even worse. Perhaps then you will also consider that nongraded activity (i.e., activity that does not build up gradually over time) can cause increased disability. So, what are you to do? The answer is \"balance\"that golden middle that most of us swing through when we go from one extreme to another. When the balance between what you can do and what you actually do is disturbed too often, your body protests, rightfully. The more this signal is ignored the more urgent and louder the protest becomes. Balance is very personal. What is balance for one person is overwork or underwork for another. So, we need to help you find your personal balancethe amount of movement that does not cause increased chronic pain or increased disability. 34 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE We are not saying that this movement won\\'t cause discomfort, especially at first. But discomfort is different from pain. When you suffer chronic pain, it may be difficult to differentiate discomfort from pain, but gradually you will learn how. The action part of this lesson really begins by asking you to change the way you approach your pain. Are you willing to change your relationship with your body from that of enemies to that of allies? To achieve this, you may have to change from \"always doing it yourself to asking others to help. You may have to change your style from rigid to flexible. You may have to change the way you solve problems. Or, you may have to do things yourself that you have been asking others to do for you. You will have to put your health and well-being above other priorities. But we promise that the results will be worth it. Note that we are not saying that it will always be easy. However, admitting something is difficult when it is in fact difficult can actually be helpful. Telling yourself \"this should be easy\" when it is hard can make things seem even more difficult. If doing what we advise is hard, let yourself know that it is hard, but persevere. All real change is difficult, especially change that requires persistence over time. Many people can lose weight, for example. The difficulty comes in maintaining that loss. The same is true with changes in activity levels. The first week you increase your level of activity may seem \"not so bad.\" But, after the novelty wears off, the difficulty may be felt acutely. It\\'s okay to admit this. The key is to persevere despite discomfort. What about the week you have a fight with your spouse or the day your car doesn\\'t start? Change is hard enough when things are going well, but it becomes even more difficult when things go wrong. Perhaps in these situations you give yourself some slack for a day or so, but no more than that. Again, the key is to persevere. Move Smarter, Not Harder One thing has likely become clear to you over timeif you had been able to get better by doing your best, you would have been better a long time ago. This is true even when you have persisted, because when something does not work, the natural tendency is give up or TRY HARDER. In this lesson, we ask you to list the movement-oriented activities that you have done and ask yourself, \"Why didn\\'t it work?\" For example, \"Could I have tried too hard? Could I have not tried hard enough? Did I not understand or have all the information I needed to do what I had to do (even simple movements or exercises require a learning curve)? Did a life event or stressor interfere with my plan?\" This self-knowledge is important, as it will help you to work with us in altering your plan or approach. Activity, Rest, and Pacing 35 In this lesson, we will follow Terry, one of our patients, who suffered from chronic bursitis in her hips (along with other joint problems). Before Terry worked with us, she felt discouraged. All the remedies suggested by her family doctor failed to bring much relief. She went to a physical therapist for a few sessions, but the exercises she suggested felt boring, and Terry failed to do them regularly. The therapist finally advised that Terry get involved in water exercise or walking, suggesting a few books that Terry patiently wrote down but had no intention of reading. After that session, Terry stopped seeing the physical therapist. But she did decide to try her last suggestion. Water sounded more interesting than walking, but Terry didn\\'t want to have to get up and get dressed, go to the nearest indoor pool, get wet, and then leave in the cold. A walk sounded really boring. After all, what could walking really do? Over the December holidays, her 80-year-old father-in-law, Bud, visited their home. Terry and her husband had given him the trip as a holiday present as Bud had never visited their new home. Although 20 years older than Terry, Bud walked 2 miles in 30 minutes every single day. He was not a braggart, and before his visit Terry never knew that .he had a walking regimen. While visiting their home, he took his daily walks. He explained to Terry that he always walked two miles a day and paced himself to be finished in 30 minutes. In the winter and in the heat of the summer, he mall-walked, but in good weather he preferred being outdoors. In Terry\\'s area, they were having a mild winter, so Bud walked outside during his visit. Terry was impressed. If he could do it, she thought, being so much older than she, she could do it too. After Bud left, she bought a good pair of running shoes (running shoes are suggested for walkers because of the cushioning they provide). Then she marked out a 2-mile path around their neighborhood. She set her goal (Bud\\'s regimen), looked at her watch, and walked the 2 miles in just over 35 minutes. She felt great. The next morning, however, she woke up with tremendous pain in her hips, and stayed in bed for 3 days afterwards. She felt completely hopeless. (To be continued.) Terry took only age into account. Because the physical therapist, whom she no longer saw, had once suggested walking, she didn\\'t think it could do any harm. Much later, after consulting us, she realized that she had tried to do too much too soon. But Terry\\'s journey didn\\'t stop before she saw us. She kept the water workout in the back of her mind. The Negative Effects of Others\\' Responses Perhaps people close to you (e.g., family, friends) were concerned or less than supportive when they did not see the improvements that they expected when you previously tried to 36 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE increase your activity level. Perhaps they began to exert pressure on you, which is not very helpful. They may be well meaning, but they are typically not people who suffer from chronic pain themselves. They don\\'t know that you typically put yourself under enough pressure as it is. For the time being, it is best to start your new level of activity in a quiet way. Don\\'t tell anyone who is apt to have too-high expectations that you are beginning a new program. It is more important in the beginning that you learn to enjoy movement once again than for you to chance a nonsupportive \"support network.\" Of course, once you start \"exercising\" to any extent, you will want to discuss details of your exercise program with your physician or physical therapist. As mentioned in the beginning of this book, our advice is not a substitute for the advice of your physician. First Steps to Enjoying Activity The first step in making activity or movement enjoyable is a mental step. You will need to work on changing the way you conceive of activity by thinking of it as a \"want\" or \"choice\" rather than a \"must\" or \"should.\" You may not think that such wording makes a difference. But listen to how it feels when you say to yourself \"I get to do this\" rather than \"I must do this.\" Try talking to yourself this way for a month and see what a difference it makes in your attitude, not just about activity, but about life in general. Choosing to do something rather than pressuring yourself to do it will reduce stress. Because stress increases one\\'s awareness of pain, decreased stress will in turn decrease your awareness of pain. Second, you\\'ll benefit by changing the way you view \"good days\" and \"bad days,\" which people with chronic pain frequently have. Why do we suggest this? If you have had good days and bad days, you may have found that on the good days you try to catch up on what you feel you have neglected on the bad days. So, you push yourself on the good days only to find that you are exhausted and unable to do much of anything on the next day. Over time, this pattern of pushing yourself on good days and then being too exhausted to do much of anything on the following days will make your pain worse. You will also find that you have fewer good days and more bad ones if you continue in this way. Instead of viewing days as good or bad, think of them as \"easy\" or \"challenging.\" On both kinds of days, try to keep to a regular schedule of activity. We\\'ll have more to say about this later in this lesson. But for now let us reassure you: We know that you can\\'t do the same thing on easy days as on challenging days. Later, we will describe how on challenging days you will still stay active, but you might have shorter periods of exertion followed by longer periods of rest and recuperation. The challenge here is to pace yourself, maintaining a reasonable, consistent schedule of activity. Sure, you may do somewhat less on the good days and the bad days at first, but by Activity, Rest, and Pacing 37 pacing yourself you will be able to accomplish more than you did when you pushed yourself too hard on one day and then were laid up afterwards. More important, by not overexerting yourself on the good days, you will be able to have a greater number of days when you feel better (note that we did not say totally pain free). The third step is to think of movement as something you will increase gradually. You want to move from Pattern A to Pattern B and finally to Pattern C, as shown here. Here you can see the gradual change in the activity-rest cycle. In Pattern A, a little activity is followed by a long period of rest. How to achieve this change is what this lesson is all about. Pattern A Activity Rest Activity Rest Activity Rest After a few weeks of pacing, you will be in somewhat better shape. Then, your pattern may be like Pattern B, when the periods of rest and activity are more in balance. Pattern B Activity Rest Activity Rest Activity Rest After continued pacing and gradually increasing, your activity level you will achieve a more optimal balance of activity and rest, as shown in Pattern C. Pattern C Activity Rest Activity Rest Activity Rest Many people set a kitchen timer or pay attention to their watch on their good days, so that they won\\'t unintentionally overdo. People who work at computers all day have used the same trick to remind them to stretch or walk around every 20 minutes or so. Working 38 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE at a computer without frequent stretching can lead to chronic pain problems (e.g., in the shoulders and back). Like yo-yo dieting, which has been shown to be harmful, yo-yo active-passive days are bad for your health as well. The important thing is to find the right balance between doing too little and too much. Before we tackle the most important tool in achieving balance-pacing, let\\'s return to Terry to see what not to do in achieving balance. Terry needed more physical therapy after she overdid it walking. The therapist again suggested gentle water walking. So, Terry decided to look into water exercise courses available in her community. She finally found a drop-in class geared for seniors (i.e., those over 55), so she thought this would work. Without checking with her doctor or physical therapist, she bought a cheap pair of water walking shoes and signed up for the class. The first class she attended on Monday was great. The teacher had arranged for the water to be warm, and Terry found that getting dressed and going out actually didn\\'t feel so bad. That night, she slept soundly for the first time in months. Part of the fatigue was due to learning the new movements in class, but part of it was getting out and moving again. The second class was on Wednesday. This time, Terry was familiar with the moves, so she could focus more on working hard like the others in the class. She couldn\\'t keep pace with them yet, but she tried to do her best. She assumed she would be at their level soon. Terry rested until the next class on Monday. This time, she was determined to keep up with the class. After all, water would cushion her joints (or so a magazine article said), and she reminded herself that there were people much older than she in the class. The following day she felt as bad physically as she had felt after her first 3 5-minute walk. Emotionally, she felt even worse. Terry felt she had \"failed\" again. (To be continued.) Terry forgot that, as with the walking, age is not the only factor to take into account when signing up for a class. Is the class geared to beginners? That is an important consideration. Is the teacher credentialed? Has he or she worked with individuals with injuries or chronic pain? Terry\\'s class had students of all levels. Terry\\'s teacher had worked with seniors, and had excellent water aerobic training, but she was new and had no experience with rehabilitative water work. Terry was also unaware that as we grow older, particularly when we have chronic pain or injuries, the time between strenous classes may need to be differently scheduled. Monday and Thursday, rather than Monday and Wednesday, would have been better for Terry. Finally, Terry didn\\'t realize that a class can, even if one is not competitive, bring out the need to keep pace with others. So, let\\'s carefully examine now what Terry would later learn the steps involved in pacing. Activity, Rest, and Pacing 39 How to Pace Yourself Pacing involves several steps that we will describe in detail later in this section. First, though, an overview. The initial step in pacing is to select an activity that you would like to do or would like to do more of. The second is to develop a baseline (i.e., where you are now with regard to that activity). The third is to set short-term goals and assess progress. And the fourth is to set longer term goals and continue the assessment process. Selecting Your First Activity Begin with just one activity (later you can add more). This can be a chore, or it can be a hobby or a form of exercise. Perhaps you would like to do more housework than you are currently doing. For some people, an orderly house is a real stress-reducer. Perhaps you would like to play golf longer or walk more during your game (i.e., ride around in the golf cart less). Perhaps you would like to do volunteer work in a community agency. If you have children at home, perhaps you would like to be more involved in their activities. Selecting the right first activity is important. You want it to be something that is realistic to do and motivating as well. If you choose something too hard, you will feel discouraged. If you choose something distasteful (e.g., doing more cooking when you didn\\'t like to cook even when you were well), you will not have an experience that you will look forward to. Later on, you can take on tasks that don\\'t appeal to you but need doing nonetheless. But first, choose something realistic and motivating. It doesn\\'t have to be big or dramatic. Perhaps you have been bed-bound. An increase in activity may simply be getting up and walking around the bed one time. Perhaps you only move from one chair to the sofa to a table and to bed. An increase in activity would be walking around the room several times. Someone with serious back problems should not carry large weights, but making the bed may be an achievable goal. Someone with shoulder tendon problems should not lift large numbers of plates at a time, but unloading the dishes one by one from the dishwasher for 5 or 10 minutes can help. This is nothing, you may think. How am I ever going to accomplish anything at this pace? Please don\\'t think that these small activities will not eventually lead to something more exciting. Trust us, they will. What you are doing in the beginning is getting a taste for success and gradually building stamina. If you are more mobile currently, you may want to consider exercising. If you have not exercised for a long time, it is likely that few forms of exercise will be appealing. Our advice here is to choose the one that is simplest and that you dislike least. 40 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Here are a few forms of exercise that our patients have found least objectionable when they first started exercising: walking on a treadmill or other flat surface while listening to music, swimming at a very leisurely pace, doing gentle stretching exercises, working with small hand-held weights (e.g., 1-2 pounds). For our patients with joint or back pain, simply walking in water at an indoor pool (at a depth that is about the same height as your chest) has been particularly helpful. Some of our patients have found gentle yoga or one-on-one pilates (the latter of which was originally developed for rehabilitation) to be useful. However, be sure that you know the qualifications of the instructor, as yoga and pilates can cause serious injury if not done properly and under adequate supervision. Also, we recommend that you don\\'t take these classes at a regular fitness center or club, because those kinds of places tend to group people together at differing ability levels. Beginners almost always overexert themselves without meaning to. A specialized yoga or pilates studio is best. However, if you tend to be competitive, it is best to stay away from any type of group activities for a while (e.g., a water aerobics class). Once you know your baseline (i.e., the next step you will learn) in a particular area, you can begin to compete (slowly!) with yourself. Chances are greater that you will not overextend yourself when you have set reasonable goals for yourself than if you try to keep up or compete (even unknowingly) with others. On the other hand, if you have an activity buddy with the same level of endurance and speed, then this can make some activities (such as water walking) more pleasurable. You can also encourage each other on days when you don\\'t feel like moving. But if someone else\\'s endurance or speed is above your level, you can fall into the same trap of trying to keep up with a friend that you would in a group activity. Think about the exercises we have discussed, and others that you may think of. Keep in mind that almost any form of movement that is not contraindicated by your physician will be helpful if you do it gradually. However, whereas exercise is one of the best ways to build stamina, it is not necessary to choose exercise in the beginning. It is most important to choose an activity that you can and will do, and that you find appealing and motivating. Developing Your Baseline The second step in pacing is deciding on a a reasonable amount of time to spend during your first week of increased activity or on how much exercise you will try to do (e.g., distance walked, number of repetitions). To do this, you must first develop your baseline. A baseline is simply what you are able to do now in your selected activity. This baseline is the activity level that you will gradually build upon. Most people have no idea of what they can normally do. But determining this baseline is critical in order for you to progress. Activity, Rest, and Pacing 41 To illustrate how developing a baseline works, let\\'s look at weight management programs for a moment. When people embark on a well-designed program, they are often counseled to write down what they normally eat for a week. They are told not to change it, just to record it. (Few people can resist changing their eating patterns after a few days, however.) You are going to do the same with your chosen activity, but not for a week, just for two days. If you have been doing some of the activity you have chosen already, simply do what you normally do and stop when you normally stop. Write down how you feel emotionally and physically before and after you do the activity. If it is an activity you do daily, we suggest that you record the activity on both a \"bad day\" and on a \"good day.\" Other than this, please do not do anything different with regard to this activity than you would normally do on these days. If you are beginning a new activity, do 10% to 20% less than you estimate you can do without a significant increase in the amount of pain or fatigue you are now experiencing. For example, if you decide to go for a walk, and you think you can walk 5 minutes, walk only 4. This will help you not overexert yourself in the zeal of getting started. Do this on both a \"good day\" and on a \"bad day.\" Record in your journal or notebook how you felt before and after, physically and emotionally, on both days. At first, some of you may only be able to move for a few minutes or do a few repetitions of an exercise (e.g., gently stretching your neck from side to side five times, performing three sit-ups, walking a quarter of a block). This is absolutely fine. The important thing is that you have started! Setting Short- Term Goals Weekly Goals The next step is to set a goal for the activity or exercise for each day of the first week you plan to begin increasing your activity level. Try not to put this off too long. On the other hand, don\\'t start a new activity program during a week that is packed with obligations already. You want to experience success! The first 2 or 3 days we suggest that you set your goals at your baseline level. This will allow you to monitor how you are doing on consecutive days. We expect that you will feel some discomfort. For most people, this discomfort is caused by using muscles that have weakened over time. By increasing your activity level in a reasonable fashion, you are not doing yourself any harm! Over time you will feel less and less discomfort even as you increase your activities. As recommended earlier, whether you are having a good day or a bad day, try to stick to your initial plan as much as possible. Let your goal of recovery be your guide, not your initial level of discomfort after increasing your activity level. 42 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE However, it should be stressed that discomfort and serious increases in pain are not the same thing! Gauge your discomfort each day. If it is minor to moderate, don\\'t worry. If it is significant or if you must rest for an abnormally long time before you recover from the activity, you are likely doing too much and need to cut back. An important part of beginning to increase your activity level is to pay close attention to the amount of rest you need between activities. Your weekly schedule of activities (which includes your daily schedule) should be a balance of more active and less active days. Your body will rest and rejuvenate during the less active days. Your body will build strength and endurance on the more active days. The key is to not under- or overstress your capacity. This is true for activities in a single day as well. Let\\'s say you are trying to increase the amount of household chores you are doing. You will need to build in adequate rest time if you plan to do two chores. For example, vacuuming for 15 minutes once in the morning, followed by a half hour break, followed by 15 minutes unloading the dishwasher may be reasonable for you. But doing both activities together (i.e., 30 minutes at a stretch) may cause too much of a strain in the beginning. Eventually you will build up to 30 minutes of housework in one stretch. But it is particularly important not to overdo it in the beginning. It is also important to keep in mind which basic muscle groups you are working when you are doing more than one activity in a day. Say, for example, you have decided to exercise using light weights. People who lift heavier weights to keep fit are told not to work the same muscle groups two days in a row. Typically, they allow 24 hours before working those muscles again (as they get older, they may need 36-48 hours recovery time). This is true for light weights as well. Your muscles should feel a tad achy the day after you have worked them; this is normal and a sign that they are becoming stronger. Even if you don\\'t feel achy, you should allow at least 24 hours recovery time before working these muscles again. If you want to do something the next day, do something that works a different set of muscles (e.g., if you lift 1-pound weights one day, perhaps you can walk a block or so [depending on your baseline] on the next day). This allows you to strengthen both your upper-body and lower-body muscles. On the other hand, you don\\'t want to allow too much rest time between periods or days of being active. Even professional athletes must watch out for this. For example, elite cyclists vary the intensity and type of activities they engage in. When there is a rest day in the Tour de France Bicycle Race, the racers actually continue to exercise, although they might not ride their bikes at all on that day. If the cyclists did not stay active and spent their entire day in bed, the next day their legs would feel like lead, and they would suffer in both body and performance. The key for you is to find that magic balance between resting too much and resting too little, doing too much and doing too little. What used to be acceptable when you did not Activity, Rest, and Pacing 43 suffer chronic pain (i.e., clenching your teeth, ignoring the pain, and pushing ahead without rest) will have a negative effect when the pain is chronic. The more you do this, the less you will actually achieve. The same goes for excessive rest. What happens to people with chronic pain who rest too much between activities? Exactly the same thing as would happen to elite cyclists if they didn\\'t stay active between hard cycling days. The next time they were active they would feel debilatated. \"Hold on,\" you might be thinking, \"What is all this talk about elite athletes? I\\'m not an elite athlete. Never was, and never will be.\" Well, neither are we. But in the same way that athletes do, we must all learn the proper balance between activity and rest. In short, we must all learn to pace ourselves. Finally, keep in mind that it is important to increase activities that involve areas of your body where you are not experiencing any pain. Ask yourself, \"What parts of my body and what movements cause me the least pain?\" When you exercise these areas, it has a positive influence on the rest of your body, including the parts where you most experience pain. Such activities stimulate breathing and the circulation of blood throughout the body. Afterwards, you are better able to relax, and this relaxation enables more energy for the things you enjoy (see next lesson). In short, one part of a reasonable exercise program is to make the strong body parts stronger. Indirectly, this will benefit the weaker and painful parts of your body. Goals for the Month Goals should be set after the first week so that you are slowly increasing the amount of time you are doing an activity or increasing the number of times that you do it. If you are having problems meeting your initial goals (i.e., excessive pain or fatigue), then cut back and work more slowly. But keep moving ahead. No two people are the same or change at the same rate, and this makes it particularly important to develop an activity plan that is suited to you personally. You can consult with your doctor or physical therapist if you need more help in developing realistic goals. But remember that only you know if you tend to go at things too hard (and then fizzle out) or whether you\\'re too easy on yourself and are therefore unlikely to achieve much, even over an extended period of time. If, after increasing an activity (such as a chore or a hobby), you decide to add an exercise program (and we recommend this later), remember to get a baseline, start slowly, and build gradually. If you don\\'t take a daily walk, don\\'t try to cover six blocks your first time out. Again, if you are the kind of person who tends to go to extremes, be careful not to overdo it, no matter which activities you chose. Don\\'t be afraid of a little discomfort, but don\\'t be reckless either! If you are progressing very slowly and are still in a lot of pain after exertion, decrease your levels of activity below your initial baseline. Do not immediately conclude, \"That is absolutely worthless. I am already doing so little.\" Remember, we are only on lesson 2. The 44 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE more impatient you are feeling, the slower you should go in the beginning. Later on, you can push yourself a little harder. But for now, trust our advice. Progressing Over Time Once you have some experience with increasing activity levels without undue pain, you can try increasing them at a brisker pace (e.g., increasing the activity 10%-20% [in the case of walking] or by 2-3 minute increments [in terms of other activities]) on a biweekly or weekly basis. However, do not increase at this level if you are doing light weight lifting. Weight lifting requires slower increases in time or in intensity. In general, remember that the human body is not built to handle extreme changes. For example, if you\\'ve ever traveled overseas, you can tell how difficult it is for your body to adjust to the sudden time change. You might also think of someone who is active during the warmer months but becomes a coach potato during the winter. When the first nice day of spring arrives, he spends the day playing golf. The sun feels so good and the movement so natural, he forgets that he is using muscles that haven\\'t been worked for several months. Each year it comes as a surprise when he feels stiff and achy the following day. Later in the season, he may not feel the same way because the muscles involved in golfing have been strengthened. The same is often true for avid gardeners. The first week of glorious spring can wreak a week of agony for knees and hips. And these are people who do not suffer from chronic pain! (A note for the eager: Once you have mastered progressing slowly and with consistency, you may be able to increase your activity level every other day. But monitor yourself for signs of overfatigue and pain.) Assessing Progress Over Time If you have kept daily records of activities and rest periods, you may find it motivating to see visually how you are progressing over time. Some people find it helpful to keep track of progress using a bar graph or chart (see Activities That Can Help at the end of this lesson). Summary To recap the most important points in pacing, when increasing activity levels, develop a baseline and build up slowly and with respect for your body. Once you have set your weekly and monthly goals, you should try to stick to them. Do not do more of your activity (even Activity, Rest, and Pacing 45 on good days) and do not do less, unless you are having a particularly bad day. Then, decrease by 10% to 20% (or more if necessary), but try not to completely stop being active that day. You want to stay in the optimal level of activity, which means neither overdoing nor underdoing what you are capable of. On that note, let\\'s see how Terry\\'s journey ended. When Terry consulted us, we explained that her problems with activity were not due to increasing her activity levels but to doing so in an unbalanced way. We agreed with her physical therapist\\'s initial recommendation for walking, but we worked with her to develop a baseline first. We asked her what she thought was a reasonable time or distance she could walk slowly. She thought for a while and then said 15 minutes. Because we could tell she tended to overestimate her readiness, we advised her to try only 10 minutes the first week in establishing her baseline, and monitor herself carefully for an exacerbation of pain. She then asked about two 10-minute walks a day. Again, we told her to start with only one 10-minute walk a day. Then she asked about adding water aerobics. Couldn\\'t she walk in the morning and do some water exercises in a class in the afternoon? Because she, like many other people, have a hard time not overdoing in a group situation, we ruled those classes out until Terry had more experience getting to know her capabilities and limitations. We also did not want her to experience undue stress in trying NOT to keep up with others at this point. In short, we wanted her to experience success this time! And, you will be happy to know that she did. How Pain and Inactivity Have Affected You When people feel pain, it affects their posturethe way they sit, stand, and move. In effect, they unconsciously adapt their posture to the pain. Pain may also make their movements slower, less coordinated, and erratic (e.g., they may jerk when they don\\'t mean to). They might move in a rigid and protected fashion. Stop reading for a moment and become aware of how you are sitting. Are you upright? Listing to one side? If you don\\'t notice anything sitting, get up and naturally walk across a room toward a mirror. Was your movement slow, tense, did you feel a tad off balance? Were you stooped in any way? Leaning to one side? Some people who have back pain, for example, may limp slightly. The intent of limping is to protect from pain, but this distorted movement not only reduces strength in the affected muscles but also places strain on the muscles that have to compensate for the awkward movement. Others who have been involved in a motor vehicle accident may have developed whiplash. To avoid pain, they hold their heads in a rigid way and reduce their neck movements. Over time, people become unaware of the restrictions or the awkwardness of their movements. 46 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE They have become habits. Restricting or altering correct movement in areas of any chronic pain may reduce pain temporarily but over time will lead to weakened muscles and more pain. In almost all cases of chronic pain, people contract more muscles than may be necessary even if it does not show in the mirror. These minute corrections have also been a wellintentioned effort to decrease or minimize pain. However, this too leads over time to more pain and greater disability. Many people with chronic pain become less active over time. One consequence of inactivity is weight gain, especially around the stomach. This added weight coupled with weakened abdominal muscles places a strain on the back and can also cause postural changes that add to pain. Once you decrease activity, over time you will feel increased fatigue, leading to more inactivity, more paina viscious revolving door that is difficult to exit. The question, then, is not whether you should be active. The question is how much activity you should perform, for how long, and in what way. In a nutshell, that is what this lesson has been all about! The goal of this is to improve strength, endurance, and flexibility, which will over time lead to decreased pain. It\\'s best, if you can swing it, to stop reading at this point and actually work on increasing your activity level by pacing. Only by doing, experiencing, and recording the results will you find out where you are now and how quickly in time and intensity you can increase your activity level. Getting started with an activity plan is critical. Assume that you will need to adjust it as your body gives you feedback (and, again, discomfort is not the same as pain when it comes to bodily feedback). A Note About Setbacks When you set up an activity or exercise program, it is likely that you will have setbacks at times (see also lesson 10). It\\'s helpful to know that this is a normal part of the change process. Those on a food plan may follow it rigorously for three weeks and then suddenly eat twice their allotted calories one on day. Falling off and getting back on the horse almost always accompany progress at certain points. Even if you do everything perfectly correctly, sometimes you will experience a spontaneous flare-up of pain. Or, you will have three highly stressful days in a row (especially around the holidays). Nothing seems to work well when it is an all-or-nothing approach. Pushing yourself with \"musts\" doesn\\'t work as well as does encouraging yourself to start your day over, even if it is 3 p.m. in the afternoon. As mentioned in the first part of this lesson, a systematic and gradual expansion of activities may initially cause your experience of pain to increase somewhat as you use unused muscles. Ultimately, however, the discomfort will decrease and the pain will decrease as you strengthen your muscles. For some, even if the overall decrease in pain seems minor over Activity, Rest, and Pacing 47 time, you will notice that more has become possible with less effort. And, the more reasonably active you are, the less you will tend to focus on the pain and the more you will enjoy daily life. The effort and concentration that used to go into protecting yourself might first go into strengthening areas adjacent to the area in which the pain occurs. For example, someone with a weak and painful back needs to begin by strengthening abdominal (stomach), arm, and leg muscles. Common Problems When Becoming More Active We know that it is difficult to begin to become more active when you have been immobile for a while. We know that it is difficult to exercise when you experience chronic pain and fatigue. (Even those without chronic pain find getting started in an exercise program difficult!) However, we also know from years of clinical experience that becoming more active in a planned and rational way will increase your strength, endurance, and flexibility, and will ultimately decrease your pain. Over time, our patients have shared their doubts about this with us, and perhaps you have a few of these doubts as well. We will try to tell you on paper what we tell them faceto- face. / worry that the exercise will make me feel even worse. Remember, any new activity will temporarily increase discomfort. Work at a level that does not cause excessive pain while doing the exercise and afterwards. Gradually increase your efforts so that overuse or misuse does not result in more pain. If the way you are doing the exercise causes pain or if you really fear that the activity will make you worse, review your activity plan with your doctor or physical therapist. I\\'ve always gotten bored easily doing exercise. Boredom is sometimes a mask for frustration. It takes time to recondition the body, and many people give up before they see improvement. If this is not the case, however, find a more enjoyable environment or activity. Some people do better in noncompetitive fitness facilities, a place in which they are surrounded by others. Some do better alone. Set specific reasonable goals each week and each time you exercise. Keep careful track of your activities so that you can see progress in black and white. I\\'ve always relied on my pain to tell me when I\\'m doing well or poorly. What can I rely on now? Pain is important to monitor when you are exercising or becoming more active in other ways. But it is not a useful guide to determine whether you are doing well. Especially in the beginning, it is better to rely on your level of effort. Later on, it will be better to focus on your ability to move further, easier, or longer as your guide for success. THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE I always tend to do too much too fast. How can I stop doing this? Doing too much, too fast is a common problem. Start slowly. Begin with easy repetitions with a relaxation pause of 5 to 10 seconds between repetitions. Do not use fast, jerky movements. Do the exercise just hard enough to feel a gentle stretch to the muscles. Do not apply force to the muscle so that you develop increased pain while you are stretching. Remember, building up your flexibility, endurance, and strength is an ongoing and gradual process. Overdoing it one day will interfere with your progress on the next. In short, make a reasonable plan, keep charts of your daily activity levels and do not give into the temptation to speed up toward your ultimate goal when you are experiencing success. / don\\'t know how to exercise. Exercise is a learned activity, just like driving a car. You may want to enlist the help of a physical therapist or a certified personal trainer who is experienced with people with disabilities and chronic pain to teach you technique. Such individuals are available in private practice or as part of large public fitness facilities. As you practice, check your technique in front of a mirror periodically. As in golf, good practice makes you better, poor practice makes you worse! I\\'ve tried exercising before, but I always gave up. What\\'s going to be different this time? This time you will prepare yourself mentally to begin, by using all the suggestions made in this lesson. You may need time to experiment, but you will find a program of activity that fits your unique personality and circumstances. And, you will not be alone. We will be on the journey with you. Activities That Can Help Critical Activities Choose an activity you would like to do or to do more of. Follow the instructions for pacing that were detailed in this lesson. If you haven\\'t started to exercise, after 2 or 3 weeks of increasing your other activities, begin to incorporate exercise into your weekly routine. Follow the guidelines for pacing detailed in this lesson. Optional Activities Establish a baseline with regard to your general activity level. How many hours a day do you spend sitting, lying down, standing, and exercising, including doing household chores? This will allow you to later see how much more active you have become on a daily basis. Activity, Rest, and Pacing 49 In the space below record the number of hours you do each of these activities: Sitting hours Lying down hours Standing hours Chores or other activities hours Exercise hours Sleeping hours Total = 24 hours 50 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Construct an activity schedule (i.e., walking, swimming, or cycling). Use the chart as a guide. It can be used for any activity. The numbers along the left can be set for the number of minutes, a distance, or the number of repetitions. Remember to start low, increase slowly, and record your performance each day.

Blaise Pascal * / 11 /ith continual pain, you may feel that you are waging a battle with your body W/VX all day. Pain may feel like the enemya monster that that makes you afraid of tomorrow, keeps you from sleeping tonight, and stops you from enjoying today. A result of this battle is that you may feel all kinds of negative emotions that add to your pain. You want to fight the pain monster or run away from it, but you find that you can\\'t fight and you can\\'t flee. So, you feel demoralized and stuck. When you try to relax, it feels like a car in neutral gear with someone else stepping on the gas. Your engine revs but you can\\'t move forward. High arousal and tension levels leave you too exhausted to move. Along with this internal pressure, you may feel pressure from others to be more productive. It may be true that your family, friends, partner, children, doctor, insurance company, and employer are in fact making life more difficult by their lack of understanding. Or, you may be reading things into others\\' looks or words, but you are so exhausted, you don\\'t realize this. If you are the breadwinner in the family or your own sole support, you may also develop financial problems that add to your distress. If you are the home manager, you may feel guilty that you can no longer do as much. You worry that others are thinking the same thing you worry about much of the timethat you may never get well. These stressors and others all interfere with your ability to get adequate rest and a good night\\'s sleep. This in turn creates another vicious circle. It is much easier to cope with pain when you are rested, but because you never seem to feel rested anymore, your coping is impaired. This leads to even more problems. In this lesson you will learn about these and other causes of tension and restlessness. More important, you will learn the positive effect of relaxation on your energy balance and on your experience of pain. Most important, you will learn how to truly relax againdespite your level of pain at the moment. 52 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE When you increase your ability to relax and achieve a more restful sleep, you will begin to feel more energetic and you will gain a new sense of control over your life. You will notice that being more relaxed lessens the severity of your pain and decreases the negative effects of pain on your life. The Energy Balance In today\\'s fast-paced and overbooked world, it is difficult for most people to maintain the balance between effort and relaxation. We are bombarded every day with seemingly endless amounts of information. And not only is the information highway crowded, actual highways have failed to keep pace with growing populations in many areas. Cell phones have been a wonderful boon in terms of being able to coordinate schedules, contact help when a car breaks down, or let your employer or family know if you\\'re going to be late. But they have had the unintended effect of making people feel that they must always be available. A minority of families are able to afford for one person to stay at home and keep the household running. But most people need two incomes, especially if they have children to clothe, feed, and educate. Single parents are under tremendous stress. The majority of people try to do too much. When you add chronic pain to this equation, you can see why you may feel stressed most of the time. To help, well-meaning people tell you that you have to take time for yourself to reduce stress. However, you often find that if you do, you are too exhausted to enjoy it. Shopping is no longer a pleasant pastime, but a tedious huntfor a parking place, for a bargain, and then for a place to put that bargain. Without meaning to, most of us get caught up in this hectic pace until our bodies go on strike. We come down with a cold or the flu or we wrench a muscle. People who are living with chronic pain are not immune to further illness or injury. There is no such thing as a life without tension. But there is an optimal level of stress. Without changes that call for adaptation, life would be boring. But too much stress over too long a period of time is not good for anyone, especially you. Those who suffer from chronic pain often feel guilty about the idea of relaxing when they are contributing less than they used to. But they are no different in their needs to recharge your batteries and leave the stress behind for a while. In the previous lesson, we emphasized the value of activity. In this lesson, we emphasize the other part of the equation true rest and relaxation. Are You Overstressed? How do you know if you are indeed overstressed? Here are some clues: You want to do many things at the same time; you consistently want to do more than you are capable of; Learning to Relax 53 you want to do nothing at all; you attempt to take control of things that are not in your control (e.g., other people, places, and events). Stress and these symptoms of stress take energy away from you. Think of energy like you think of money. When the expenses are higher than the income, sooner or later you\\'ll be in financial trouble. When your body uses up more energy than it produces, you will feel physically and emotionally bankrupt. This may be hard to believe when you think about how you have been doing less and less since your pain began. But living with pain is another stressor unless you learn how to manage the pain through a balance of activity and relaxation. If you are having trouble grasping this, think of it this way. When you are overstressed or underrelaxed, the muscles in your body naturally tense. This means that at least half of your body weight is under tremendous pressure. This pressure can increase your heart rate and cause shallow breathing, which increases fatigue and exhaustion. Furthermore, for many people, proper nutrition is the first thing that is sacrificed when they are under stress. They either eat too much, too little, or the wrong food. In any case, their body is running on the wrong amount or type of fuel. Most important, these effects of being over stressed and under relaxed can increase your pain. Let\\'s try another analogy, because people are surprisingly resistant to suggestions that they need to relax. When you buy a car, you\\'re interested in whether your car will last over time. You\\'re also interested in whether this complicated machine will need special maintenance. With energy costs skyrocketing, you\\'re most certainly interested in the prospective car\\'s fuel consumption and how this fits in with your budget. Your body is complex, much more so than your car. If you want your body to have enough fuel to enjoy your life, you have to make it more energy efficient. And you certainly want to conserve fuel so that you can take care of routine activities. This is where relaxation comes in. When your body is tense, your muscles are consuming unnecessary fuel, fuel that you need for enjoyment and for the requirements of daily life. Conserving Energy The first step in conserving fuel is to learn to know when you are tense and when you are relaxed. This is more difficult than most people think. Very often, people are unaware of their bodies, except for the experience of pain. Especially when you are under tension for extended periods, you are unconsciously tense and unknowingly consuming a great deal of fuel. Tension is both mental and physical. Let\\'s try a small exercise to help you learn what physical tension feels like. Make a fist with your right hand. Clench your fist tightly. Really squeeze it tight. Feel your fingers pushing into your palm. Hold it there! 54 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Now bring your clenched fist up toward your shoulder and press the fist against your shoulder. Feel the muscles in your forearm and your biceps (the muscle between your elbow and shoulder) begin to quiver. Hold it there. Count to five. This is muscle tension. If you keep this up long enough, you will experience pain, eventually even unbearable pain. Now, compare how your left hand and arm feel in comparison with your right. Note the different feelings and sensations between the right and the left hands and arms. Your left is in a state of relaxation; your right is in a state of tension. Now, slowly relax your fist and arm. Bring your fist down from your shoulder slowly. Let your muscles relax. Move your fingers away from your palm, relaxing your fist. Slowly bring your fist and arm down to rest loosely on the arm of your chair, a table, or your lap. Do you see how different this feels? This is relaxation. Relaxation feels different to different people. For some doing this exercise, their right hand feels warm. For others, it tingles, feels a bit heavy, or feels very light. Notice the difference in how your right hand and arm feel now compared with when you tensed them. Even with this short exercise, you have learned that you have some control over muscular tension and that you can bring about muscle tension and muscle relaxation through conscious effort to some degree. This means that you have more control over your daily tension levels than you previously thought and that you have power that you have not yet harnessed. In this lesson, we hope to help you learn how to harness this power to reduce your pain. Sources and Symptoms of Excess Stress Because excess muscular tension is often unrecognized, it is helpful first to learn more about the most frequently occurring sources and symptoms of chronic muscular tension and stress. Be aware that rarely do people have all these symptoms, and that what is stressful for one person may not be for another. Here are some of the sources and symptoms people in our practices have shared: Sensory Overload Heavy traffic, noisy groups of people, and loud radio and television advertisements make many people tense. Some people with chronic pain report problems with bright lights; others feel greater sensitivity to cold and damp weather. Learning to Relax 55 How about you? Stop and think for a moment. Have you noticed a lower tolerance for some forms of sensory stimulation than you had before your pain began? Emotional Vulnerability When people have chronic pain, they commonly feel distressed and overwhelmed, but they often stifle their emotions, especially over small things, until they feel they will explode. Then, they may break down and cry or have a fit of temper at unexpected times. These outbursts are troubling, but it helps to know that they are almost always a result of stored tension. Some of these negative emotions you feel or stifle are triggered by the sense of futility you have felt over managing your pain. You may then feel guilty about mood changes or \"irrational feelings.\" Guilt alone is a great stressor. How has your pain influenced your mood? Do you often feel upset, angry, or depressed? Some people have difficulty accepting these negative feelings. It is okay to admit these feelings, if only to yourself. Such feelings are not unusual, but they can contribute to increased muscle tension and thereby increased pain. People with chronic pain have often adapted to this by tuning out their bodies as much as possible. The first step in dealing with the stress that is draining your energy is to pay closer attention to your body. By this we mean that the next time you notice a feeling, begin to pay attention to all of your bodily sensations. Do you notice any tension in any of your muscles? Does your body feel numb (except for the pain)? It takes time and practice to tune in to your body in this way, but it is critical to your success in managing your pain. Tension and numbness can also be caused by the thoughts that you have at the time you experience an emotion (e.g., frustration) or stressor (e.g., dealing with a particular person). When you experience stress, in addition to paying attention to your body, try to catch what you are thinking. Thoughts are fleeting, and it takes practice to catch them. But this skill, too, is critical to practice. We will return to the role of thoughts and feelings in pain management in lesson 7. For now it is important to simply understand that thoughts and feelings can increase muscular tension and pain and that awareness of bodily sensations and thoughts can help relax muscles and reduce pain. Uncertainty and Fear Fears of open spaces, anxiety while traveling in cars and other enclosed vehicles, fear of crossing bridges, and heightened tension in shopping malls are all quite common in the general population. These fears can be accompanied by dizziness, shortness of breath, and rapid heart beat. This in turn can lead to further anxiety and avoidance of situations that cause these distressing sensations. However, avoidance of travel, outings, and social situations can increase feelings of isolation and actually increase stress over the long run. 56 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Other fears are less specific and can be experienced as \"free floating\" anxiety. Common concerns our patients have found to underlie these fears are (a) their pain will never end; (b) their pain or underlying condition will worsen; (c) they will become progressively more disabled and dependent on others; and (d) people won\\'t believe how bad their pain really is. Such fears and thoughts often occur spontaneously and are accompanied by rapid, shallow breathing. This type of breathing can occur without awareness and can also increase muscle tension directly and lead to anxiety or panic attacks. Later in this lesson, we will teach you some skills to help you breathe through these stress-provoking situations and feelings so as not to increase your stress and pain. Loss of Concentration Tension, as well as pain, often interfere with concentration and memory. Also, some medications for pain can have these effects. These may be dose dependent (i.e., the more medication taken, the worse the side effects), so lowering dosages can sometimes help with these cognitive problems. People with chronic pain often describe their state of mind as similar to walking around in a fog. Have you felt a decrease in your ability to concentrate and remember things since your pain began? Do you feel sometimes as if your brain is in a fog? Has your pain affected your memory, your concentration, and your attention span? Chronic Fatigue Some people with chronic pain also feel a sense of \"chronic fatigue\" or constant tiredness. They start the day feeling tired, so they often wonder what\\'s the sense in getting out of bed. Sitting or standing for a long period may feel daunting, and climbing the stairs seems like climbing a mountain. Every effort seems to be too much to bear. When they push themselves, they feel as if they are engaged in battle, with pressure in their chests and a racing heartbeat. Much of this is the result of being physically unfit from restricting activity. Using fuel in appropriate ways makes the body more fuel-efficient. That is why the last lesson was so vitally important, even in terms of chronic fatigue. Some people try to pep up their overloaded nervous system with stimulants (e.g., prescribed medication, nicotine, caffeine). This may help at the moment, but actually leads to more exhaustion later on. This is because it is possible to artificially boost the exhausted body for a short time. Over time, however, these stimulants backfire, overwhelming the nervous system and creating more anxiety and stress. As people become physically dependent and require larger quantities of these stimulants to get the same effect, they become more exhausted still. Learning to Relax 57 Sleep Problems It seems strange to many of our patients that despite their fatigue, their sleep is not refreshing. Many have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Their sleep may be fitful, and they wake up more tired than they were when they went to bed. Some people are not even aware their sleep is disturbed until they ask their partner or room with someone else temporarily (e.g., on an outing or a retreat). Think about yourself for a moment. How would you describe your pattern of sleep? Do you toss and turn a lot? Do you wake up feeling just as tired as when you went to sleep? Digestive Problems Some of our patients report problems with swallowing, feeling \"too full,\" being constipated, having frequent diarrhea, losing their appetite, overeating, or alternating over- with undereating. They often report an increase in weight, most often because of inactivity and extra snacking to fill up the space pleasurable activities used to occupy. This extra weight makes their bodies less fuel efficient and contributes to tension and fatigue. It also results in feelings of unattractiveness. For example, one of our male patients used to enjoy ballroom dancing, but he no longer went dancing because of the increased visible weight he carried. Many women turn down routine social invitations that could potentially increase their energy because they are embarrassed about their weight gain. Changes in the Immune System Additionally, our pain patients have reported increased problems with infection and allergies as well as a heightened susceptibility to colds and flu. This typically results from a combination of inactivity, poor diet, daily stress, and the stress of coping with chronic pain as opposed to the original cause of their pain. Whereas the immune system must fight germs all of the time, the stressors and symptoms described in this section deplete the immune system\\'s arsenal in such a way that the person who suffers from chronic pain may actually be more likely to incur other illnesses. Relaxation can help replenish this arsenal in addition to helping decrease pain directly. But how exactly does one learn how to relax? Learning to Relax We have already mentioned two major skills involved in learning to relax: bodily awareness of stress and emotions and mental awareness of thoughts that accompany stress. Whereas we will have much more to say about thoughts in later lessons, in this lesson we will focus on bodily relaxation. 58 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE You probably already \"try\" to relax. Some methods are better than others. Think of whether you use any of the following methods. Alcohol and Other Drugs Alcohol (yes, alcohol is a drug), antianxiety prescription drugs (e.g., valium, clonazepam), and some antidepressant drugs relax the muscles. The result is that feelings of arousal, worry, and tension may be temporarily reduced or suppressed. However, these muscle-relaxing drugs have the disadvantage of addiction or tolerance. (Tolerance means that you continually need more of the drugs to achieve the same effect.) If you have been taking such drugs for more than a week, do not stop taking them (with the exception of alcohol, perhaps) unless you are under the supervision of a physician. You cannot stop most drugs rapidly or \"cold turkey\" without your body responding in alarming or harmful ways (e.g., seizures). If you start to reduce these drugs even under the supervision of a physician, or even if you stop drinking alcohol abruptly, you may notice some unpleasant side effects (e.g., headache, sweating, flu-like symptoms, difficulty sleeping or concentrating). Even stopping caffeine can have strong effects. One of us (Dennis Turk), a frequent caffeine consumer, reduced his caffeine intake all at once and began feeling like he was in a fog. He was unable to concentrate and had a throbbing headache for 10 days. So, it is better to gradually wean yourself (with the advice of your physician) from any prescription and nonprescription drugs you are using to reduce stress. (Note that we are not talking about specific pain medications herethese are a totally different topic.) Television and Reading Many people use television to tune out. People, in general, tend to unwind in front of the television at night. But more than an hour or so of television ceases to be relaxing and becomes a substitute for living. Others become \"hooked\" on romance novels or mysteries. Again, these are healthy outlets if they are used moderately. Reading in bed for 3 hours on a regular basis, however, can be as unhealthy as watching television for the same length of time. Computer Games and the Internet Many people become \"addicted\" to playing computer games (both interactive and solitary), to Internet gambling, and to shopping online. Time seems to fly when they are online, and Learning to Relax 59 hours go by in a sort of haze. Not only does excessive involvement (i.e., over 1 hour a day) in these activities decrease social skills and increase inactivity, it also can cause repetitive stress injuries. Thus, they can add insult to injury for people already experiencing chronic pain. Relaxation Exercises Some of our patients had tried relaxation exercises before they consulted us, but these activities didn\\'t seem to work. At times this was because they had chosen a form of relaxation that didn\\'t fit their personality, and at others times it was because they didn\\'t stay with the process long enough. Some people benefit from relaxation involving imagery (mental pictures), others benefit from tapes (video or audio), and still others need some physical activity while they relax (e.g., floating in water, gentle stretching). If you choose a method that is not right for you, you will be unlikely to enjoy it or keep practicing long enough to achieve results. Learning to relax takes practice. Patients with serious heart problems, for example, are asked to do daily relaxation exercises consistently for 90 days before they can expect to see results. This is because real relaxation seems deceptively simple, but it is really a hard skill to learn. You must learn what method is right for you and then you must practice, practice, and practice. If you do practice consistently, you are likely to feel out of sorts when you miss a session, or feel like you do when you have forgotten to brush your teeth. In this lesson we will focus on a few of the many ways to learn to relax. If the ways we have described do not work for you, do not give up. There are a variety of audio relaxation tools and also classes in many communities that teach relaxation in different ways, including in groups. You may be the type of person that benefits from relaxation in a group! There are many different ways to relax your body and your mind. We describe several different methods below. There is no one best way to relax. The important thing is to find some means of relaxing that is comfortable for you and to use these activities on a daily basis. They should become just as much a part of your daily routine as brushing your teeth. Systematic Muscle Relaxation As you learned earlier in this lesson, there are muscles that are under your control even if you are not aware of it at the moment. Skeletal muscles fall into this category. There are 60 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE however, also muscles that do their work more automatically and without conscious awareness (e.g., the internal muscles of the digestive system [stomach and bowels] and your heart muscle, among others). With practice, however, you can gain some control over many of these muscles as well. We have provided some exercises to help you relax muscles in Appendix 3.1. Breathing Correctly Many people are \"chest breathers.\" That is, they suck in their abdomens and expand their chests with each in breath. This may be particularly true for women because in Western culture they are taught early in life that the \"proper\" posture is one in which the abdomen is flat at all times. This posture is difficult to maintain when you are truly relaxing. Diaphragmatic breathing, which produces the truly relaxing breath, requires the stomach to move in and out with each breath. If you want to observe natural diaphragmatic breathing, watch infants when they breathe. Their tummies move gently in and out with each breath. Many people also become shallow, chest breathers because of prolonged anxiety, stress, and tension. When tensed, your breathing naturally becomes faster, more shallow, and from the chest. Stress tends to increase tension in the abdominal area, so the diaphragm cannot contract completely and the abdominal wall cannot move out when taking a breath. Only the chest expands as a result, causing further tension. The first step in learning to truly relax, the one you must master before you proceed further, is to practice diaphragmatic breathing. Brief periods of diaphragmatic breathing provide for your body\\'s energy needs in two ways. First, this type of breathing is best able to remove the carbon dioxide from your blood. At the same time, it produces oxygen, both great sources of energy. Second, breathing properly ensures beneficial massage of the abdominal organs. (This is why gentle yoga can be effective as well.) Diaphragmatic breathing can bring about a feeling of calm and relaxation when it is properly practiced. To feel your diaphragm during breathing, place your hand just above your stomach, take a slow deep breath through your nose, and feel the movement of your hand as you do so. As you breathe out through your mouth slowly, you will find yourself relaxing without even trying. Longer and deeper breathing of this sort can make \"normal\" breathing easier and more relaxed When first learning how to breathe in this way, it often helps to lie down on a cushioned floor, knees slightly bent, and to place your hands on your stomach. In this way, you can feel the abdomen rise when you breathe in and contract when you breathe out. Try practicing 10 minutes or so while you are doing something passive in the morning, afternoon, and evening, such as listening to the radio. Exercise 3.1 that follows provides detailed instructions for practice. Learning to Relax 61 Exercise 3.1. Controlled Breathing Before you begin practicing, you may want to read over this exercise a few times. Some people find it helpful to tape record themselves reading the exercise and then play it back. You can try different methods. We recommend that you wear loose, comfortable clothing and that you find a quiet, relaxing place to practice. First, lie on your back. Place your hands just above your navel or \" belly button\" Close your eyes and imagine a balloon inside your abdomen. Each time you breathe in, imagine the balloon filling with air. Each time you breathe out, imagine the balloon collapsing. Now inhale slowly and deeply in through your nose. Let your abdomen rise as you breathe in to the count of 4 (slow, e.g., 4 seconds). Then, slowly (e.g., to the count of 4) exhale through your mouth, feeling your abdomen sink as you do so. Try practicing 10 breaths about 3 to 4 times a day. Once you have been able to do this, on the next day, with each slow breath in, focus on a single word such as CALM; on the out breath think of a related word, such as RELAX. Some people who belong to a religion or spiritual practice, find two words from their faith to focus on. If none of these options appeal to you, simply repeat BREATHING IN on the in breath and BREATHING OUT on the out breath. Try to stay with the words you have chosen, which may be more difficult than at first appears. When your mind wanders, gently bring it back to your word as you breath in and out. If you are still having difficulty, try to choose a short word or shorten the word you have chosen and focus on each letter. For example, if you have chosen the word calm, as you breath in you would focus on each letter: M Once you have mastered this, you can begin to focus specifically on relaxing the muscle group that is easiest for you to relax. The next day, add another muscle group. Gradually work up to 15 minutes of controlled breathing, focusing, and relaxation. As you get better and better at this, you can try it out even when you are not sitting or lying down but are more active. In fact, some people find this exercise easier when they are stretching or slowly 62 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE walking. In this way, you can take brief, mini-relaxations for a few seconds or minutes at any time. We have included visualization exercises at the end of this lesson (see Appendix 3.2). You can try these out and see how they work for you. Remember, becoming more skilled at controlled, relaxed breathing may take some time. So, don\\'t be discouraged if what initially sounds easy is, in fact, a bit difficult. Many of us have a running monologue or dialogue in our heads most of the time, and it takes practice to quiet this voice. You also may not feel immediate results. The body is not used to this kind of practice. It barely remembers infancy, when this kind of breathing came naturally. With practice, your body will begin to trust your mind again, and some days you will find these exercises both effortless and rewarding. Try each of the different techniques discussed in this lesson and find the ones that are most helpful to you. You may find that different methods work better for you at different times. One man we treated became so good at diaphragmatic breathing that he taught and coached his pregnant wife so that she could control her breathing during the delivery of their first child and thus experience less pain. Attention Diversion Another way of achieving true relaxation is through diversion. Those who suffer from chronic pain naturally tend to focus on their bodies, on how severe the pain is, and on how much they can or cannot do. This is human nature. We each have the untapped ability, however, to attend to other things, at least some of the time. You can consider some ways to use your intentional focus to distract yourself when your pain is difficult to bear. Many of our patients reply when we say this, \"I can\\'t distract myself. My pain is too severe.\" Here, we gently suggest that they try out some of the exercises and see what happens. We remind them that controlling attention when you have pain is difficult, and it helps to admit when things are difficult. And, we tell them that they will not experience immediate relief. Effective distraction, like controlled breathing, takes time and practice. There are several ways to relax by diverting attention. The way diversion works with pain is based on the principle that we cannot focus on everything that is going on around us all the time. For example, while you are reading this lesson some sounds are likely going on in the background. Stop for a moment and listen. What do you hear? It might be the sound of the fan on your air conditioner or heater. It might be the wind blowing outside your window, traffic noises outside your home, or the ticking of a clock. In the same way, there are feelings within our body that we fail to pay attention to all of the time. For example, you may have a watch on your wrist or ring on your finger. If Learning to Relax 63 you do, focus on how they feel against your skin. How about your socks or shoes? How do they feel? How does your back feel against the chair, couch, or bed on which you are reading. You may not notice these sensations until they are the focus of your attention The important thing about this is to realize that all of these sensations are always going on, but out of habit we do not pay attention to them. This is because attention can be likened to watching a television or listening to the radio. All of the stations are there all of the time, but we can only tune into one station at a time. When it comes to our pain, many people do not realize the power of focus and attention, particularly distraction. By distraction, we can choose what will be the focus of our attention for a specific period of time. You have probably made use of attention diversion or distraction without even realizing it. You might read books or magazines, study religious materials, listen to music, work on a hobby, or listen to someone when they call to talk on the telephone. Sometimes when you do these activities you may even lose track of the time or where you are. In each of these cases, your attention is highly focused and you are likely not aware of many things going on around you. We do not suggest that you should try distracting yourself all of the time, but there are times when distraction can help you feel a greater sense of control, create relaxation, and reduce the intensity of your pain. It is important to remember that you have at least some control over the focus of your attention. It is fine to be skeptical that you will be able to distract yourself. However, it is worth your effort to try. Spiritual Focus: Meditation and Prayer One way to divert attention from pain and induce a state of relaxation is to focus on some spiritual word, phrase, or prayer. When we discussed controlled breathing earlier, we mentioned that spiritual words can be used in conjunction with this type of breathing to help you relax. Prayer by itself or a focus on a religious figure such as Jesus, Mohammed, Buddha, or the spiritual being some call a higher power can be tremendously calming. Others find focusing on a sense of oneness with nature to be helpful. If this kind of focus appeals to you, you can focus on whatever you find most meaningful and relaxing. Sensory Focus We also tell our patients that if their pain, worries, or seemingly insoluble problems have kept them upset for a long time, it is not possible to let these difficulties go all at once. We 64 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE ask them to practice visualizing one pleasant experience for a period of time. They are instructed to reach into their memories and recall a happy or peaceful time. They close their eyes and focus on each visual aspect of that scene. Then we ask them to focus on the sounds and smells associated with that scene, as well as the tactile memorieswhat the sun felt like if it was a summer scene, what the cold felt like, if it was winter. Try this now, at least once, for a few minutes. It can also be helpful to see yourself in pleasant places to which you may never have gone: ^ Picture yourself in the cool of dusk, sitting at the edge of a lake. Look at how the water reflects the light from the moon, feel the cool breeze against your skin, and hear the birds off in the distance. ^ Picture yourself walking through a park on a beautiful autumn day. Hear the breeze rustling through the tall trees. Feel your feet sinking into the soft ground as the golden red, yellow, and orange leaves rustle beneath you. + Picture yourself lying on an uncrowded beach at the ocean. Feel the sun on your face. Hear the breaking of the waves. See the horizon line as you look in the distance. Enjoy the feeling of space around you. Sit up and watch the different tints of blue, green, and gray in the sea. Enjoy the clear blue sky. Perhaps have a cold drink or Popsicle. Taste it. Savor each drop. Which drink or flavor did you choose? We are sure that you can think of many other scenes once you get the idea. Such relaxing images have a direct effect on muscle tension. Focusing on these can take your mind off your pain, even for only a moment. The particular image that you use in coping with pain is not the most important thing. The most important thing is to be involved in the image, so that all of your attention is focused on the image and the sensations. Whenever possible, make use of all of your senses vision, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. As in the breathing exercises, your attention may wander from time to time, and you may occasionally find yourself dwelling on unpleasant sensations. But you can gently bring your attention back to the pleasant image or scene when you notice that your attention has wandered. As you first start this practice or when you practice on bad days, you may still be somewhat aware of the discomfort or pain. But these will gradually fade into the background as you focus on the sensations associated with the scene. The pain may not disappear, but it may be more like the ticking of a clock or the sound of a fannoticeable but not too irritating. What would be a pleasant scene for you? What would you include? Pleasant images bring with them a feeling of safety. (In Appendix 3.2 at the end of this lesson, we have included a detailed sample of a scene that many people find pleasant.) You might read this over and then try to experience it yourself. Once again, you may wish to make a tape of yourself Learning to Relax 65 reading this scene. Perhaps someone you are very comfortable with may be willing to read the scene and record it for you. If you have trouble coming up with a scene, look at pictures in nature, island travel, or pictoral magazines. Many libraries have such magazines available. Even if you don\\'t use the scene in a focused exercise, just looking at such pictures can be relaxing. The same is true with watching nature channels on television. Keep in mind when you use such scenes that there is no reason for you to feel locked in to any one image. If you find the scene that you are using to be ineffective or even distressing, you can easily switch to another scene. Some images may inadvertently unconsciously recall distressful times in your life that you may have forgotten. Also, some images fade and become less vivid after a while. You can elaborate on such images by including other senses, such as the tastes and smells associated with a picnic in a lake or forest scene. You might also bring movement into the picture. For example, picture yourself dancing alone on the beach. There is no limit to what you can include, as long as the image is not distressing. At times you may find that you can maintain one very detailed image for a long time. At other times, your mind may flit from one image to another or you may find images merging and blending. This is fine, as long as you are relaxed. There is no right way or wrong way to do this. Try to find what works best for you. Creating a Pleasant and Safe Home Environment In addition to creating peaceful spaces in your body, it is important to create a peaceful refuge in your home. Do you have a favorite room or a part of a room where you feel most peaceful? Are you able to set limits on family members so that you have time alone in your \"space\"? Think about this and how to approach family members (if needed) to safeguard your haven for at least part of the day. Even an hour can do wonders. Here are some experiences that our patients have reported as being refreshing and refueling as they manage their pain. + I nestle myself in my most comfortable chair and put on my favorite music. Sometimes I choose music that suits my mood. If I feel sad, I allow myself to listen to melancholy music. If I feel peppy, I play something lively. I really try to listen to the music. In particular, I resist the urge to do something else at the same time I am listening. ^ In the evening, I take a warm bath or shower at around 8:00 p.m. Then I put on my favorite pajamas. I choose relaxing reading material. Books of meditations 66 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE (e.g., daily readings) and children\\'s books are my favorites. Then I settle into a comfortable chair with good lighting and light a candle with a lavender scent. After reading for about a half hour, I am ready to go to sleep. + I find poetry to be a great way to relax. I try to read passages in the rhythm the author intended. Sometimes I listen to poems on cassette tapes or CDs. Besides alone time, many people find the company of good friends in their relaxing space to be a great solace. As several of our patients told us, ^ I always seek the company of people with whom I can be my real self. I invite them over in the evening in winter, light a fire, put on soft music, and fix a pot of decaffeinated tea. With some friends, I may offer a glass of wine. Then I try to simply be present with them in the moment. If I find myself talking too much, I try to remember that listening is more relaxing than talking at these times. + It took a while, but I finally convinced my husband to spend 15 minutes just relaxing on the couch with me. No television. Sometimes we listen to old radio programs that have been recordednothing stressful (like the news of today). Sometimes we just listen to music that we both enjoy. Now, my husband looks forward to our relaxing time as much as I do. + I asked my wife to spend time with me in the evening. Just nestling together. No sexual demands, just tender touch and caressing. She was leery at first. But now she understands that I just want to hold her and be held. I\\'m not trying to set up a prelude to sex. Interestingly, though, our sex life at other times has improved as a result. The theme of all these patients\\' experience is that relaxing means not \"doing\" or \"having\" but simply \"being.\" They also illustrate the importance of letting go of expectations and approaching each period of relaxation with an open mind and an open heart. There are no rights and wrongs, no shoulds or musts, no measures by which they rate their period of relaxation or its results. These patients have learned that despite pain they can learn to enjoy the moment, without having to achieve anything. Really Enjoying Food Sometimes when we are in pain, we have no appetite. It is hard to even think about eating, let alone enjoying a nutritious meal. At other times, we may use food as an anesthetic. We eat mindlessly to take our minds off our pain. Really planning a nutritious meal and eating in a slow relaxed way may seem foreign to us at those times. However, nutritious meals Learning to Relax 67 served in your nicest dishes, even if you are dining alone, can create a sense of peace and relaxation, as well as contributing to good health. Maybe you use food in unhealthy ways. If you do, perhaps just once a week you can make one meal something special. Plan the menu, and set aside time to set the table so as to create a \"dining atmosphere\" (e.g., you can use candles, flowers, or your favorite dishes, placements, or table cloth). After you have prepared the meal, sit down and really take time to savor each bite of food. Some people find it relaxing to have some soft music in the background. Reading while eating, however, tends to distract one from the pleasure of eating. If this seems too much for you right now, try doing the same with a snack of fresh fruit in the middle of the day this week. Enjoying a relaxed meal or snack not only induces relaxation, it also aids digestion. After the meal or snack is over, take time to have decaffeinated coffee or tea. If you are alone, perhaps you can use this time to think about next week\\'s special meal or tomorrow\\'s snack. Even planning the meal or snack can be relaxing and can be a helpful distraction from pain. Try this for a few weeks. If you find that it relaxes you, you can increase the number of meals in which you truly enjoy your food in the weeks to come. Enjoying Nature and Other People Pain often gives one a feeling of being imprisoned, isolated, and alone. To decrease the feeling of being a \"shut in,\" try to plan an outing that is not too taxing and that involves being in a natural environment. Maybe there is a park or some woods in your area, or maybe you are fortunate enough to be near a river, lake, or even the ocean. If it is winter, dress in layers, so you can adjust to the temperature as needed. Perhaps you will only stay 5 minutes at first. Eventually you may find yourself staying longer. If it is too cold or hot, perhaps you can people-watch at a mall, coffee shop, or bookstore. Some people like just to be around people without having to necessarily interact with them. Give yourself options. Try to get out of the house at least once a day at first, even if only for a few minutes. Try this for at least a week. Then, you can adjust the frequency and length of outings to fit your particular situation. Giving Yourself Room to Breathe What we have described so far is only part of the large number of relaxing activities. Others include massage, fishing, sitting in the sun (with sunscreen), or going to an outdoor cafe for a glass of iced tea in the summer. (We have listed more activities on pp. 89-90 at the end of lesson 4.) 68 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE None of these activities needs to cost much money. The most you need is gas for the car or some change to buy a cup of coffee, tea, or a bottled water. And you\\'ll need one other thing: patience. It\\'s odd to think that you have to be patient to learn to \"be\" and to do the simplest things. But it is true. Give yourself the gift of relaxation, even if it takes a while to find what relaxes you most. The nonactivity you choose is not as important as giving yourself permission to experiment, to forget your worries, and to find room to breathe and get to know yourself again. Summary You can create your own ways of relaxing, just by practice. If you are better able to relax, despite the pain, you will have increased energy, a longer attention span, and a greater ability to concentrate. Over the course of a day, alternating what you have learned in this lesson (relaxation) with what you have learned in the previous lesson (increased activities) can improve your life immeasurably. When you are in chronic pain, you may feel these lessons are too simple or too basic to help. You may wonder how they will help you decrease your pain. With this in mind, let\\'s recap some of the main benefits of learning to relax: ^ If your muscles are tense, you use energy that can be better spent on the things you want to do or enjoy. ^ If your muscles are relaxed, you produce energyphysical, mental, and emotional. + When you balance activity with relaxation, you learn to hear more clearly what your body is saying to you. Therefore, you will not do more than you are able to, but you will not do less. + With the peace that comes from maintaining a proper energy balance, you become able to let go of things that are truly not in your control. Coping with pain requires a lot of energymental, physical, and emotional. When activity is balanced with relaxation, you put money in your energy bank. When this equation gets out of balance, you withdraw money from the bank. Pretty soon, your account is overdrawn and your pain levels increase. As a result, you can become oversensitive to stimuli and experience chronic fatigue and sleep problems. When your energy account is flush, you will find that the pain or your experience of it will be less. Your immune system will be strengthened, and you will experience less fear and better concentration. Learning to Relax 69 Activities That Can Help Critical Activities 1. Controlled breathing exercise. Practice controlled breathing at least twice a day every day this week. Start with 2 minutes the first day, then add a minute each day thereafter. Record your experiences in your journal or notebook. Some people find it helpful to have a written script that they can follow as they learn to practice controlled breathing. The following is one suggested script: + Sit or lie down in a comfortable, relaxed position. + Inhale slowly and deeply through your nose. ^ Hold your breath and count up to 4 at 1-second intervals (\"a thousand 1\", \"a thousand 2\", \"a thousand 3\", \"a thousand 4\") and then slowly exhale through your mouth. ^ As you hold your breath, think of a single word such as \"C-A-L-M\" or P-E-A-C-E,\" to help free your mind from distracting or stressful thoughts. You can also say \"breathe in\" as you\\'re breathing in and \"breathe out\" as you\\'re breathing out. + As you exhale, let your chest and stomach muscles relax, and if seated drop your shoulders. Repeat this cycle at least three times for approximately 3 to 5 minutes. 2. Identifying pleasant scenes. In your journal or notebook, describe a scene or situation that you have found pleasant (e.g., a walk in a meadow). Try to include as much detail as you canwhere you are, what you see, what you hear, what you smell, what you taste, and who is with you (if anyone). Once you have prepared this example, try to focus on the details as you do the controlled breathing exercises described earlier. Relax by slowly inhaling and exhaling and focusing on one of the pleasant scenes you have written down. 3. Choose a day in the week to plan for your special meal or snack. Allow enough time for rest after preparation of the meal so that you will truly enjoy it. Optional Activities 4. Thinking back in time, recent or long ago, answer the following questions: ^ Where and with whom have you been able to relax? Did you relax more alone or with others? 70 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE + Were there certain activities (or nonactivities) that made you more relaxed? ^ Were there certain thoughts, worries, or people who interrupted your relaxation? In the same vein, were there thoughts or people who made you feel more relaxed? + Were there particular times of the day when you were best able to relax? Morning, afternoon, evening? 5. Some people have more difficulty than others with relaxation. If you do, you might consider the following: + Forgetting to relax: The use of charts to record activities (described earlier) and keeping these in a visible place can help. + Mind wandering to worrisome thoughts: Redirect your thoughts by focusing on something pleasant. ^ Falling asleep: This is not a bad thing. If it happens frequently, try to find another time of day to relax. + Difficulty concentrating on breathing and guided relaxation: Make an audiotape or have someone make one for you. You can then play the tape and concentrate on the voice and the instructions on the tape. 6. Make a daily schedule in which you experiment with a good balance between exertion, diversion, and relaxation. As with other exercises, you may find it helpful to create or record your progress: Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Morning Afternoon Evening Total min mm min min min min min min min min nun mm min min min min Friday Saturday min min mm mm min min min min Learning to Relax 71 Appendix 3.1 Progressive Muscle Relaxation Some people find it helpful to have a script for focusing while relaxing: Now, close your eyes for a few moments and focus on how your body feels. Move your focus to different parts of your body and see if you can notice any tension in any particular part. How about where you have the most pain? Can you detect any tension there? You may feel more pain when you focus on it. That\\'s natural. You may not feel any tension at first. That is natural as well. Just let what is \"be\" without judging the exercise or yourself. If you notice tension in any part of your body, compare that sensation to body parts that don\\'t feel so tense. Now just let the tension go, let it drift away. It might be helpful to imagine the tense body part feeling more and more like the parts of your body that do not feel tense. Now, curl the toes of your left foot toward the bottom of your foot or the floor. ^ Hold this tense position. Feel the tightness in your ankle and the sole of your foot. As you feel it, note how it feels exactly. ^ Now, relax your foot by moving your toes away from the bottom of your foot or the floor. + Let your toes relax. Let the tension drain from your toes. Feel the warm comfortable sensations of relaxation that you have been able to produce. + Pay attention to these sensations and notice how they differ from the cramped or tight sensations of tensing your muscles. ^ Repeat with right foot, but replace the first sentence with, \"Pull the toes of your left foot up toward your face.\" Continue using these instructions, replacing the first sentence with the instructions below, and alternating right to left where applicable: Now, tense the muscles in your left thigh by pressing hard against your other leg. Relax your left thigh . . . (Right) + Tighten the muscles of your buttocks by pulling them toward each other. Relax your buttocks. + Tighten the muscles of your stomach as if you were trying to protect yourself from being punched. Relax your stomach muscles. + Pull your shoulder blades toward each other. Relax your shoulder blades. ^ Hunch your shoulders toward your ears. Relax your shoulders. + Press the upper part of your right arm against your right side. Relax the upper right arm muscles . . . Do the same with the left arm. 72 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE ^ Make a tight fist with your right hand. Relax your right hand . . . Do the same with the left hand. ^ Push the back of your head hard against the floor or chair to tighten your neck muscles. Relax your neck muscles. ^ Clench your teeth together, push your tongue against the roof of your mouth, and smile to expose as many teeth as you can. Relax your mouth. ^ Squint your eyes tightly shut, and wrinkle your nose. Relax your face. ^ Raise your eyebrows as high as you can to wrinkle your forehead. Relax your face. If you notice any tension left in a particular part of the body, compare those sensations to parts of the body that feel relaxed. Let the tense body part drift into the same feeling as the relaxed body part. Learning to Relax 73 Appendix 3.2 Example of a Pleasant Image Read this example through and then try to imagine yourself in this or a similar scene. It may be helpful to audiotape yourself reading or have someone you care about make a tape for you. Picture yourself standing by the shore of a large lake, looking out across an expanse of blue water and beyond, to the far shore. Immediately in front of you stretches a small beach and behind you a grassy meadow. The sun is shining brightly and feels very pleasant, bathing the landscape in a shimmering brightness. It is a gorgeous spring day. The sky is pale blue, with a few soft, fluffy clouds gently drifting by. The breeze is blowing gently, just enough to make the trees sway and to make ripples in the grass. Feel the wind on your cheeks. You have this perfect day entirely to yourself, with nothing to do and nowhere to go. You have a blanket, a towel, and a bottle of lemonade with you, and you carry them lightly as you walk through the meadow. You find a spot, spread the blanket, and set your lemonade aside. Now, lie down on your blanket. It is a soft spot, and you feel comfortable. There are only a few gentle noises: a bird chirping, the breeze occasionally blowing over the meadow. The quiet is very peaceful and relaxing. Tell yourself to just relax and take it easy. Think about the warm, beautiful day. Feel the sun on your body. Totally let go of your cares and enjoy the sensations you are feeling now. After a while, you hear the water lapping at the shore in the distance. You take a drink of your lemonade, savoring the sour sweetness. You walk toward it, feeling the soft, lush grass of the meadow under your feet. You reach the sand of the beach and feel the different texture under your feet. The sand is warm but not too warm. Let any tension remaining drain into the sand. Now visualize yourself walking into the water slowly. Feel the refreshing wetness as the water reaches your ankles. As you feel ready, walk in the water until it is up to your knees. The sun has warmed the water pleasantly. It is almost like being in a bath. As the breeze continues to blow gently, you look around. You have this lovely spot all to yourself. Far across the lake you can see a sailboat, tiny in the distance. It is so far away that you can just make out the white sail jutting up from the blue water. You stay in the water as long as you like. When you are ready, return to your spot at the meadow. Take another drink of lemonade. Lie down and just enjoy. 74 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE It is a warm spring day, and the sun has grown hotter, but it is still pleasantit is a comfortable, dry heat. Your body absorbs this heat and further relaxes. As the day progresses, you are partly in the sun and partly in the shade. Feel the difference on your body. Look up at the sky and watch the clouds. Sometimes they seem to form animals or things. You can hear the sound of a bird gently singing in a tree nearby. You smell the sweet grass around you. You are totally relaxed. If you\\'d like, take more time to continue imagining pleasant scenes and sensations, enjoying the positive feelings you have been able to bring forth. L E S S O N 4 Are You Always Tired? Ways to Combat Fatigue In your hierarchy of values, nothing can have higher priority than health, And if you find time for watching television but not for walking, swimming or jogging, You are violating the most important rule of time management, which is to do the most important things first. Edward C. Bliss hronic pain is usually accompanied by chronic fatigue. Many of our patients report that they do not get a good night\\'s sleep, and that they doze off and on during the day. As a result, they lack energy, feel weak, and experience tiredness, even after mild exertion. So, it is not only the pain that causes you to limit your activities, it may also be an enduring sense of fatigue and weakness. This kind of tiredness can be every bit as disabling as the pain itself. You may drag yourself through the day. You feel as if you can\\'t even face minor chores. Everything seems like too much. Without really meaning to, you tell everyone by your behavior, \"Leave me alone.\" The troubling thing is that this sense of fatigue never seems to go away, even when you are inactive and do little or nothing. Even though you believe you hear your body saying \"take it easy, sit down, or lie down for an hour,\" you\\'re not sure that that\\'s the right thing to do. You wonder if you can trust your body at all. In this lesson you will learn the following: + What causes extreme fatigue and how it can be overcome. ^ How your sleep, eating, and activity patterns affect your store of energy. + How certain lifestyle habits rob you of energy. ^ What is most important in restoring your energy balance so that you can feel rested again. 76 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Your Body\\'s Energy System Your own energy system can be likened to a power generator or a battery. A generator needs fuel to create power. If there is no fuel, even the strongest generator is unable to produce power. The fuel for your body is created in tiny energy centers in your cells (mitochondria). These mitochondria need a small amount of energy to be able to function adequately. Like a car battery, your own \"battery\" can only be charged when you still have some energy in reserve. When you are too tired, your body does not even have enough energy to produce the minimal charge you need to be active. It is important, therefore, to maintain sufficient energy reserves. If you go to sleep exhausted, there will be no electrical charge to allow your battery or energy centers to operate. That is why you may wake up tired even before you begin your day. Let\\'s begin with a simple suggestion. As we noted in earlier lessons, it is important that you learn to know and respect your own limits. In lesson 2, you learned to pace your activities so you can conserve your energy. A good balance of activity and rest throughout the day will ensure that there is still fuel left in reserve for your power generator to operate throughout the night. If you skipped over or skimmed lesson 2, this might be a good time to read or review it. There are many kinds of tiredness. The following sections describes three kinds: emotional, physical, and nutritional. Emotional Tiredness After strenuous physical activity it is normal to feel some fatigue. If you have worked on the suggested activities so far, you are well acquainted with this normal sense of physical tiredness. There is, however, another sort of fatigue that is often ignoredemotional tiredness. This kind of tiredness occurs when you have to do boring, uninteresting, or repetitive work. It can also occur when you are alone and isolated or when you are annoyed and frustrated. It most often occurs in relation to other people. For example, as we will discuss in a later lesson, miscommunication and conflict with friends and family can create enormous emotional stress. This stress leads to emotional tiredness. Being around someone who is tiring (e.g., complains, \"yes, buts,\" always sees the glass is half empty, or talks nonstop) is not as rewarding as sitting quietly with a friend whom you value. Reading romance novels is not as satisfying as reading about inspiring figures. Lack of success at what we try is an often unrecognized cause of emotional tiredness. It is exhausting and draining to continually feel as if one has failed or fallen short of expectations. This emotional tiredness often occurs with our chronic pain patients. When they begin Are You Always Tired? 77 becoming active and balancing rest with activity, they feel what they are doing does not amount to much. We remind them that there is a big difference between what they want to do eventually and what they are able to do in the present moment. Change evolves gradually, if it is to last. Do you get annoyed with yourself and your progress? Do you feel frustrated? Do you get angry with yourself when you cannot do what you want to do? Many of our patients do. We explain to them that this constant annoyance and scolding of oneself increases feelings of fatigue. For many, these feelings and fatigue are too quickly linked to the \"amount\" of activity. This is not always true. Quality of activity may be more important than quantity. For example, gamblers are able to stand for hours behind a coin-operated slot machine, without being bored or fatigued. Many have to virtually wrestle themselves away from the machine or go broke before they stop this repetitive action. (A similar activity with a strictly predictable result would be deadly boring and thus tiring.) Some of today\\'s students (or adults) can spend hours in concentrated thought when they are playing computer games. When faced with necessary chores they do not like, they can become fatigued after a relatively brief period. So, when considering progress, the quality, not the quantity, of activity needs to be taken into consideration. Playing solitaire at the computer for 2 hours is not as qualitatively good for a person as walking for 10 or even 5 minutes. Sitting in front of the television for 2 hours is not as qualitatively successful as doing a relaxation exercise for 5 or 10 minutes. One way to avoid this kind of emotional fatigue is to define success on your own terms. When you are resting, choose to do things that really increase your self-worth or induce relaxation. When you are active, choose activities you look forward to doing, or people that you look forward to seeing. This is particularly important at the beginning of your efforts. Later, you can take on activities that may not initially engage you and give them a try. Many people do not realize that these emotional factors can drain their energy and make them feel tired. You might have thought: \"I do not understand why I am so tired, I have done practically nothing.\" With chronic pain, emotional fatigue invariably plays a role in chronic tiredness. Physical Tiredness As we noted in lesson 2, chronic pain affects your posture and especially the way in which and the extent to which you move about. You may have noticed that since your pain began you have moved more and more slowly and perhaps your posture has changed. As we discussed in lesson 2, these changes occur because your muscle strength starts to weaken when you are inactive and your posture changes when you are trying to protect yourself from pain. These changes often lead to additional inactivity, weakness, and reduced 78 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Pain Inactivity Inactivity Fatigue Figure 4.1. Pain-activity-fatigue circle. strength. Thus, the vicious circlepain causes inactivity and postural change; these lead to more pain; more pain leads to fatigue; and fatigue leads to inactivity, and so on (see Figure 4.1). You may have found that increasing your activity level as we suggested in lesson 2 has increased your feelings of fatigue. In the short-term, this may be true. If you have been inactive for some time, your muscles are weak. However, if you gradually build up the amount of activity you perform, you will find that the increased muscle tone will allow you to do more for longer periods of time without a sense of exhaustion. (If you have done too much after reading lesson 2, you may feel more tired as well. Review your charts to see if you may have started at too high a level. Or, perhaps you did not allow enough rest between periods of activity.) Please do not be disheartened if things are going slowly in terms of progress. This is to be expected. But if you stick with your plan, even if you have had to modify it, you will begin to notice improvements in your muscle flexibility, strength, and endurance that will allow you to do more with less pain and fatigue. The improvements will occur at different rates for different people. A benefit of becoming active and exercising is that it helps the body increase the production of internal pain-relieving chemicals. Research has demonstrated that the body actually produces its own analgesics or pain reducers that are similar to morphine and are referred to as \"endorphins.\" Thus, endorphins are the body\\'s natural pain reducers. This explains how as you increase your activities not only will you build up your muscular stamina but you may also experience a reduction in pain. Many of our patients have suffered from chronic pain for a long time. It takes time to undo the effects of inactivity and to allow the body to increase its production of these natural Are You Always Tired? 79 pain reducers. As we tell our patients, be realistic. Do not expect change to occur over a few days or weeks. Stay with us for the long haul. Nutritional Tiredness Pain, discomfort, and resulting negative moods can have different effects on people. For some of our patients, appetite disappears. For others, appetite increases. Both eating too much and eating too little have a negative influence on energy levels. How is your appetite? Do you eat three regular meals each day or six mini-meals? What about too frequent snacking of the nonnutritional kind? Have you lost or gained weight since your pain began? If you eat too little, it may be because food has lost its appeal over time. Or you may not feel that you have the energy to prepare a meal. Perhaps your pain is so severe you feel you just can\\'t make the effort. Or, perhaps you nibble snack foods throughout the day that do not require much preparation but have little nutritional value. Even here, you may feel you have to force yourself to eat. When you do not eat enough of the right kinds of food, you receive too little of the right kind of fuelfuel that can turn into consistent reserves of energy. Another disadvantage of eating too little or eating the wrong foods is that the muscle tissue breaks down. Less muscle means less power, and also less energy. On the other hand, many of our patients report that their appetites have increased since their pain started. When we ask them what they are eating, we learn that it is usually their \"comfort foods.\" They want comfort because of the pain, but also because they are often alone and bored. This is natural but dangerous. For these eaters, between meal snacks are often a particular problem. The extra calories of snacks (usually something sweet or salty or buttery), cause them to gain weight. If they are inactive, this weight gain often skyrockets, because inactivity reduces the number of calories burned. For these inactive patients, even eating the same amount of food they ate before their chronic pain began can lead to increased weight. And, again, another vicious circle is created: pain leads to comfort eating; this leads to increased weight; increased weight leads to increased fatigue and inactivity; comfort eating begins again, and so on. What can help? Because during the day you need energy, you need to begin eating three nutritious meals (or six mini-meals) regularly. Eat as little as possible between these meals or mini-meals. If you do require some snacks, consume fruit or raw vegetables with fat free dip instead of cookies or potato chips. Another problem all of us face is that we are often on automatic pilot when it comes to eating. As described in lesson 3, many times we eat without even being aware that we are eating. We taste the first bite, but we space out or do other things while eating so we really 80 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE don\\'t taste much of the rest. Try eating more mindfully and slowly. Try to savor every bite. You may find that you are full on much less food this way. If you are a comfort food eater, before turning to food, ask yourself, What am I feeling? Consider the following emotions: anger, irritation, or frustration; sadness, disappointment or depression; grief; hopelessness, helplessness; hurt or fear; worry or anxiety; passivity or boredom. Just recognizing which emotion you might be feeling at the moment you feel like having a donut can help you make different choices. If you still feel like snacking, ask yourself, \"Does this snack contain good calories?\" Will it provide me with an immediate \"lift\" only to let me down later? Will it provide me with energy or will it simply add to my weight?\" Are there any substitutes that might do the trick (e.g., sugar free cocoa and whole wheat toast instead of a chocolate bar)? Finally, if you are having trouble with weight, consider eating your main meal (or mini meals) during the middle of the day. At night, we don\\'t require as many calories, so a light evening meal and a small nutritious \"bedtime snack\" (e.g., a bowl of oatmeal or a cup of skim milk) may be all that you need. Tips for Losing Weight Our patients have shared with us a number of tips for losing weight and thus gaining energy: ^ Eat a balanced diet. + Use nutritional counts (e.g., such as calories, fats, carbohydrates, or protein). + Avoid \"crash diets\" or \"fad diets.\" ^ Lose weight slowly so that you can learn how to eat to maintain your weight later. + Decrease size of portions and use a small plate. (It\\'s amazing the difference a small plate makes!) ^ Exercise before you eat. ^ Eat slowly; savor each bite. Find a nutrition \"buddy,\" \"partner,\" or weight loss support group (some are free). + Eat more fruits and vegetables. Dietary and Nutritional Supplements We are frequently asked about the benefits of vitamins and dietary supplements for fatigue and chronic pain. Although many people report on the benefits of these supplements, we know of no consistent scientific evidence to support these claims at the current time. This Are You Always Tired? 81 does not mean that some supplements are not useful; there is just not sufficient information to draw any firm conclusions yet. One problem is that dietary supplements are not regulated, so it is nearly impossible to know what and what amount of any supplement is helpful. For example, omega 3 oil has been helpful for heart patients, but the amount of omega 3 in proportion to omega 6 oils in supplements varies widely among brands of this supplement. In addition, there is limited information about the interaction of the active ingredients contained in supplements and prescribed pain medications and over-the-counter drugs. Claims for excessive benefits often appear in newspapers, magazines, television, and the Internet. Many people believe that if they are publicly endorsed, then they have been approved by some governmental or watchdog agency. This is not true. The U.S. government (Food and Drug Administration), for example, monitors claims for prescribed medication, but it does not oversee food supplements. Moreover, no agency controls what information appears on the Internet. In short, be cautious of excessive claims for the benefits of dietary supplements, as these are often based on little scientific evidence. These claims often rely on personal testimonials that are used to help the company make a tidy profit. Endorsement by famous people (for example, a television or movie star, a retired athlete, or a doctor who stands to profit) does not mean the product will be helpful. If you have a personal physician who is knowledgeable about supplements, that is the person to ask. Other Ways of Improving Sleep A puzzling thing for many is that tiredness as a result of pain and fatigue does not automatically lead to deep and refreshing sleep. You may have noticed this yourself. How would you describe your sleep? Consider the following questions: Is your sleep restless? Does your body more or less remain in a state of alarm throughout the night? Do you have problems falling asleep at night? Staying asleep? Do you have bad dreams or nightmares? Does your pain wake you up during the night? If your answer to one or more of these questions is yes, you almost surely do not feel rested when you wake up. How is your general mood during the day? Consider the following questions: Are you often irritable? Do you feel sad for no apparent reason? Do you often feel like \"giving up\"? Have you lost interest in activities that you can still do? Do you sometimes feel \"worthless\"? Many people who suffer from chronic illness or experience chronic pain become depressed. This is not surprising. Who would not become depressed if, in addition to the \"daily routine of life,\" they had to struggle with illness or pain every day? Who wouldn\\'t be depressed if every day they were aware of the things that they were no longer able to do? 82 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Lack of sleep and poor sleep quality can be a symptom of depression. It can also worsen the other symptoms of depression described above. So it is no surprise that when people do not get restful sleep, they often try prescribed or over-the-counter sleeping pills. Others turn to alcohol as a way of getting to sleep or staying asleep and avoiding feeling depressed. Unfortunately, these remedies, if used for more than 2 weeks, can actually worsen the sleep problem. Many of these drugs (yes, as noted, alcohol is a drug) are addictive if used daily over even a very short period of time. And they do not really solve the sleep problem; they only temporarily mask the symptoms. Changing thoughts and behaviors can improve some symptoms of depression, and in a later lesson we will help you with that. But for now, let\\'s continue with our discussion of sleep. It is important to know that the amount of sleep you get and the quality of that sleep are not the same. This is because there are four stages of sleep, each with very different characteristics. In general, there is a light stage of sleep and a very deep sleep, in which dreaming often occurs. It is this deep sleep that is truly refreshing. Sleep medication or alcohol may lead to light sleep throughout the night, so that when you awaken you notice that a number of hours have passed but you may still feel tired. And, again, there is the problem of dependence. If you feel desperate about your sleep right now, consult a physician who is trained to treat sleep problems (not all physicians are). If you can hold off for a while in terms of your sleep, the program described in this book, followed consistently and resolutely, should lead to a gradual but steady improvement in sleep patterns. In Exhibit 4.1 we have listed a number of things you can do to achieve the deepest levels of sleep. Some of these may be familiar to you already. Although doing or not doing things on this list will help, be aware that just as you cannot \"force\" relaxation, you cannot \"force\" sleep. The only thing you can do is to consistently take our suggestions to heart (and do them!) over a period of time. Our patients have also found the following suggestions to be helpful. + Cut back on your caffeine during the day. Caffeine, as most people know, is a stimulant. That is why so many people \"need\" a cup of coffee to get them going in the morning (they also \"need\" it because their bodies become physically dependent on caffeine). Even people who know that caffeine \"arouses\" them, may not know that caffeine, even if consumed early in the day, can interfere with sleep. We don\\'t suggest to our patients that they go off caffeine \"cold turkey.\" First, keep a log of how many drinks that you have each day. Gradually cut back (e.g., cut out one caffeinated beverage one day; cut out that one and a second the next, and so on). + Design your own personalized bedtime ritual. The human body likes a fixed rhythm and regularity. Sleep rituals involve consistently following the same steps before you go to bed. For example, some of our patients lay out their sleep clothes, read a meditation or other comforting short passage, and take a warm bath before they go Are You Always Tired? 83 Exhibit 4.1. Do\\'s and Don\\'ts for a Good Night\\'s Sleep Do\\'s Don\\'ts Keep a neat and comfortable bedroom; change linens at least once a week; buy good pillows if you can afford them; choose a firm (not too hard or soft) mattress that does not squeak. Have radios, TV\\'s, stereos on in the bedroom; read in bed. Relax before you go to bed; read in the living room; listen to soothing music. Drink or eat caffeinated beverages or foods (e.g., coffee, tea, chocolate) after 2:00 p.m. Keep your room at a temperature that helps with your sleep (depending on your age and gender, this may differ). Drink alcohol after 7:00 p.m. Have a set time to wake and go to sleep. Take unscheduled naps during the day. Reserve the bedroom for sleep or sexual activity. Watch TV or read in the bedroom. Balance activity and rest throughout the day. Eat balanced meals or mini-meals. Be too active one day and be a slug the next. Allow yourself a transition period before bedtime. Develop a bedtime ritual. Exercise close to bedtime (i.e., 23 hours before you go to sleep). Get out of bed if you have not fallen asleep after 20 minutes. Go to another room and do something that is not interesting, stimulating, or exciting for one-half hour. Stay out of bed longer than 30 minutes if you got up because you could not sleep. to sleep at night. All of our patients find that going to bed and getting up at a fixed time, even if they have slept poorly the previous night, is helpful over time. Avoid naps during the day. Naps may seem natural when you have not slept well the night before. But they often interfere with sleep at night. Get up if you have not fallen asleep after 20 to 30 minutes. Stay up for 20 minutes in another room doing some rather boring activity (e.g., do not do the crossword or THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE read mysteries). If you feel sleepy, don\\'t allow yourself to fall asleep in a chair. Even if you do not feel sleepy, go back to bed after 30 minutes. If you still do not get sleepy after 20 minutes, repeat this ritual. Remember not to do any \"arousing\" activities (e.g., television, radio) or to think about worrisome topics when you are up. For the first week or so you may feel somewhat tired during the day, but your body and mind will gradually learn that you mean business when it comes to sleep. Keep with this until you fall asleep for the entire night. Remember, even if you are bone-tired, you cannot force sleep. But you can set up the right conditions for sleep. ^ When not asleep in bed at night, relax your muscles. Even if you do not fall asleep, lying relaxed will help you feel better. If you fall asleep in a relaxed manner, you will feel much more rested. You might find this a good time to review some of your pleasant mental images. A (Necessary) Return to Pacing Pacing is so important that although we have covered it in lesson 2, we want to stress it here as well. A pattern of overactivity followed by exhaustion and pain most often leads to poor sleep. For example, if you are overactive one day and underactive the next, the following night you are unlikely to sleep well. The body loves consistent and healthy patterns. (It will get hooked into bad patterns but it really prefers good patterns to follow.) Taking breaks from activity on schedule (rather than when you are exhausted) is a good pattern. Getting up and being active on schedule (rather than when you feel like it) is a good pattern as well. As mentioned earlier, some of our patients buy an inexpensive kitchen timer to remind them when a period of rest or activity is scheduled to occur. This kind of balance gradually builds into a serene and healthy lifestyle that decreases pain and increases enjoyment. We call this \"balanced growth,\" as illustrated in Figure 4.2. Staying between the dotted lines (optimal level of activity) means growth, success, and energy. Too much activity or inactivity means setbacks, anxiety, failure, and fatigue. Remember, the pattern of resting before becoming excessively tired is not laziness. It is healthy pacing that allows you to have energy in reserve. During a break from activity, you should plan to do something pleasant and relaxing, something that you enjoy. It\\'s best to determine before your activity period what it is you want to do when you rest. Regularity is the key to pacing. Skipping a break to try to do more or skipping activity when you want to do nothing often leads to a loss in the ability to be active when you most want to. Moreover, this kind of irregularity can often increase pain and interfere with sleep. In the beginning, however, it is important to experience success. So choose restful activities and more energetic activities for periods of time that you can handle. Increase these gradually, so that you can be energized by improvement. Are You Always Tired? 85 Activities Too much activity > Optimal level of activity Too much inactivity Time Figure 4.2. Balanced growth. The Importance of Realistic Expectations in Combating Fatigue Many of our patients observe that they need to rest for a rather long period after they first start exerting themselves. They consider this to be abnormal (\"After all, I\\'m not 99!\")- These thoughts bring up all kinds of distressing feelingsshame, guilt, sadness, frustration. You may feel this as well. What you were able to do in the past (Figure 4.3) was what you considered a decent level of exertion followed by a brief period of rest and recovery. Your typical day in the past went like this: you woke rested, carried on a number of activities during the day, rested at the end of the day, and finally you went to sleep. This activity-rest cycle most likely became connected to your feelings of success, your sense of self-worth, and your level of confidence. You may not have been aware of this at the time, because you considered it \"normal.\" When you begin to experience chronic pain, this \"normal pattern\" may be disrupted entirely or at least in large part. When this occurs, or if you try to push yourself back into your earlier pattern too soon, the result will likely be feelings of failure, loss of self-esteem, and diminished confidence. Nevertheless, old habits die hard. Many of our patients used to 86 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Your old pattern NORMAL BEARING CAPACITY 14 Hours 10 hours ACTIVITY REST Working, exertion Relaxing and Sleeping Self-worth, satisfaction, and confidence Figure 4.3. Common pattern of activity before chronic pain. get up each morning resolving to achieve their old activity pattern. In the evening, they feel dejected and as if they have \"failed.\" These patients, when they first see us, are only able to reach the activity level shown in Figure 4.4. Is the activity pattern shown in this figure familiar to you? Does it reflect the reality of your life? If it is, you may find that hard to accept right now. This is okay, too. Acceptance takes time and patience. But it\\'s hard to move from where you are to where you want to go until you begin to accept what has happened as the result of your pain. You may need to grieve these losses in ability to be active in order to accept them and move on. Part of why people push themselves too hard is that they begin to up their activity level, feel happy and hopeful, and try to immediately return to their earlier levels of activity. For 1-2 hours 22-23 hours EXERTION INACTIVITY Figure 4.4. Chronic pain activity pattern: The new reality.

The new pattern of activity: A better approach. these people, acceptance of their current limitations may be one of the most difficult tasks they face in this book. A more appropriate pattern of activity for people who have chronic pain was described in lesson 2. However, acceptance and the level of pacing (see also Figure 4.5) can lead to more consistent days of higher self-esteem, feelings of greater success, and more pain reduction. This is a message of hope to all who suffer from chronic pain Diversion, Priorities, and Control Although some of these topics have been or will be discussed in more detail in other lessons, we would like you to consider them here with regard to combating your chronic fatigue. Diversion In addition to pacing, the diversion activities described in lesson 3 bear repeating in terms of chronic fatigue and sleep problems. A change of scenery, getting out of a rut, or doing something nice (alone or with others) gives us a boost. Journaling, painting, drawing, sewing, quilting, collecting things, enjoying nature, a weekend away, a good film, an interesting book, and an exciting TV series can all be useful distractions. Beware of perfectionism in some of these more \"artistic\" pursuits, as this can add stress to your life. 88 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Priorities When you\\'re in chronic pain, it\\'s easy to lose sight of priorities. But it is helpful to give what attention you can to those things that deserve itthe truly important things in life. For different people, this means different things. For some it means family, for others, it means friends, for still others, it means the ability to pursue some hobby or creative outlet. By creative outlet we do not mean painting the Sistine Chapel. Cooking a delicious and beautifully presented meal is creative. Arranging a vase of flowers with mindfulness is creative. What is important to you now? What has been important to you in the past? What was \"worth the trouble\" to do before your pain began? Who was it important to stay in contact with? Setting priorities is most important for people with chronic pain and fatigue, because energy is more limited for them than for people without pain. What are your time-wasters or energy-drainers? Certain people, certain thoughts, mindless television? Dwelling on the past? These all consume precious energy. Prioritize them out of your life If you are still working inside or out of the home, you may believe that hard and long hours of work are important. But most people realize at least at retirement or at the end of their lives that work has not been that important. When you ask children, \"What do you value most in your parents?\" or when you ask adults, \"As a child, what did you consider your parents\\' best attribute?\" the answer is never, \"They kept the house clean and worked hard at the office.\" Nor is it, \"They worked hard so that we could have lots of money.\" The answer that is more common in happy families is, \"They had time for me.\" \"They showed interest in me.\" \"They listened to me and truly got to know me.\" These are important things to ponder not only with regard to others but with regard to oneself. How much of your time is spent showing interest in your whole self, not just your pain? How often do you truly listen to your own heart? How well do you know yourself? Control Another energy drainer is trying to control things that are not under your control. On the other hand, if you put your energy into things that you have some control over, with practice (e.g., pacing, nutrition, acceptance, perseverance, patience) you will feel more successful, hopeful, and energetic. Your pain will likely become easier to bear. Remember the Serenity Prayer: \"Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference between the two.\" Are You Always Tired? 89 Activities That Can Help Critical Activities 1.

Are You Always Tired? 91 2. If you are having trouble sleeping, keep a sleep and caffeine diary. Begin by recording the time you go to sleep at night and estimating how long it takes you (approximately) to fall asleep each night. If you nap, write down how many naps you take, when you took them, and how long they lasted. Keep track of the amount and times you consume drinks or food with caffeine. How many times a week do you spend in bed doing activities other than sleep or sexual intimacy? These facts will give you a baseline from which to work. 3. Keep a food diary for 2 days. Record everything you eat including snacks and when you ate them. In your notebook or journal, describe how tired you were before and after eating each meal or snack. 4.

Choose a time-consuming task you have been putting off and plan how you can gradually complete this task by pacing over a week or two. 6. Consider the following questions carefully and write down your answer in your notebook or journal: How much acceptance have you experienced with regard to your current limitations? Does acceptance mean that you made your peace with your limitations? How might you begin to accept that your pain and your former way of managing it has caused you difficulty? Would talking to someone about this help? L E S S O N 5 Don\\'t Let Pain Ruin Your Relationships! Open yourself genuinely to all people By being willing to fully communicate your deepest feelings, Since hiding in any degree keeps you stuck in your illusion Of separateness from other people. Ken Keyes and Bruce Burkan / ^J s you know by now, many people are uninformed about pain. They often \\\\^^r -/. assume that pain, although unpleasant, is temporary. They also believe that it will, within a brief time, be easily treated or will simply go away on its own. By extension, they may believe that the person who continually experiences pain is not really feeling pain, is not following doctor\\'s orders, is complaining excessively to get attention, or is trying to avoid some undesirable activity. When people complain of chronic pain, others often consider them weak (or in common parlance, \"wimps\"). Many of our patients believe that the people around them think one or more of these things. Do you? If you do, you may feel misunderstood, lonely, distressed, frustrated, angry, or some combination of these emotions. The Importance of Communication Other people may say well-meaning things, but their words may inadvertently make things worse. \"Give it time,\" one may say. But you have already given it lots of time, \"You need to see another doctor,\" a second suggests. But you have already seen three doctors. \"Have you tried ibuprofen?\" a third asks. These kinds of suggestions or questions sometimes make you wish that everyone would just leave you alone. However, there are times you don\\'t want to be left alone. Chronic pain is a lonely experience. You may feel abandoned by others. You may wish for emotional support, especially 94 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE when the pain is at its worst. And you honestly do need help with some things at some times. If only they knew how hard it was for you to ask! On their first visit to our offices, many of our patients tell us that their lives now revolve around their bed, lounge chairs, TV, doctors\\' offices, clinics, and pharmacies. They feel lonely and isolated. Does this describe your situation? The likelihood of feeling isolated in this situation is greater if you feel you have no one with whom you can freely share your feelings and know that they are not judging you. Perhaps you find it hard to express yourself. Perhaps you attach great value to your independence and don\\'t want to admit that you need support. Or perhaps there is no one around who truly understands. Your Role in Effective Communication But first consider this. Friends and family members can feel excluded, powerless, and frustrated if you do not communicate your feelings to them in an open waya way in which they can truly hear you. If you cannot clearly express your feelings and accurately describe what you need from them, it is hard for them to support you. In all relationships, it is the quality, not the quantity, of communication that determines whether people become distant and defensive or whether bonds are strengthened and deepened. The more people skillfully share each others\\' lives, each others\\' desires and longings, each others\\' worries and uncertainties, the greater their mutual satisfaction. This kind of communication may be difficult for you if you haven\\'t first communicated these things to yourself. If you can clearly express what you do need and what you do not need, first to yourself and then to others, and if you let family and friends know that they can play a meaningful and important role in your recovery, then you have a real chance at gaining support, affection, and encouragement. Most important, you will not feel so alone. The feelings of safety and security that result make pain easier to bear for everyone. For the person suffering from chronic pain, these feelings reduce stress, help him or her get important needs met, and thus actually can decrease pain. Even when pain is at its worst, feeling safe and secure through trust and understanding makes the pain easier to bear. In this lesson you will learn about + the impact of chronic pain on other people; + the importance of good communication and assertiveness; + ways to improve your communication and assert yourself; and + how to create a supportive environment. To begin, consider the experience of one of our patients with regard to how chronic pain affected her relationships with other people. Don\\'t Let Pain Ruin Your Relationships! 95 Rita is a 46-year-old woman who has suffered from 3 years of severe and chronic pain following a car accident in which she was rear-ended. She initially suffered from a whiplash injury that was treated. But the pain diminished very little and has now spread from her neck to multiple areas of her body. She has recently been diagnosed with fibromyalgia. Rita also reports frequent headaches, tingling in her fingers and toes, difficulty sleeping, trouble concentrating, and chronic fatigue, even when she gets a good night\\'s sleep. She reports that almost any activity makes her pain worse. Rita\\'s pain has been severe enough to disrupt all aspects of her life (work, social, family, and recreational). Her pain does not permit her to get a good night\\'s sleep. Consequently, she never feels rested and is tired most of the time. Rita acknowledges that since her injuries, she has not had time for her husband, Paul, and her teenage children, Greg and Tara. Her house is no longer as neat and tidy as it used to be. Paul was initially sympathetic but now says that he is fed up with her constant complaints. The expenses of her medication and medical treatments have drained the family\\'s finances. This has meant giving up family and other pleasurable joint activities. Paul says this wouldn\\'t be so bad, but Rita has no interest in any previously enjoyed activities or even in sex. She just wants to be \"left alone.\" Rita\\'s children are troubled by her behavior as well. They feel that she has become a different person since the accident. They are anxious about her unpredictable behavior and mood swings. They feel discouraged by her lack of progress toward being \"their old mom.\" When they are around Rita, they are extremely solicitous, getting her snacks, coffee, medication, and rubbing her neck. Inside, though, they seethe. Rita is uncomfortable asking for things, so she ends up ordering them around. At times, she belittles them for no apparent reason. No matter how well or quickly they do the housework, it never seems to meet her standards. Then they feel they cannot do anything that will please her. They will never be \"good enough\" for the injured Rita. At the time Rita and her family come for a consultation with us, the teenagers are confused and angry, and they have begun to stay away from home as much as possible. At the same visit, Rita acknowledges that she is angry with them because they avoid her. She accuses them of not caring. Then she begins to cry, admitting that she feels depressed and guilty about her words and behavior. Paul, who is a plumbing supplies salesman, has also recently been spending more and more time away from home, often volunteering for extended selling trips. His inaccessibility has led to more anger on Rita\\'s part. The continual conflicts have driven Paul even further away, and he has had some fleeting, but not serious, thoughts about getting a divorce. Unfortunately, Rita\\'s story is all too common. Living with chronic pain not only causes the patient to suffer but also has an effect on every member of the family. 96 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Are you aware of the impact of your pain on others? Have you noticed how their behavior affects what you think, how you feel, and what you do? What advice would you have for Rita? What would you say to Paul and the children? Sharing With Family and Friends There is an old expression, \"A sorrow shared is a sorrow halved.\" Living is sharing both the good times and the bad. The more people share in each other\\'s lives, the greater the likelihood their relationships will bring mutual fulfillment. When one family member has chronic pain, this kind of sharing and mutual involvement becomes more difficult. Things the couple or family used to do together they can no longer do. Time and money spent on visits to the doctor take the place of time and money for dinners out or nice meals at home. We tell our patients that first they need to think about how they can compensate for lack of time with their families and friends. We stress the importance of quality time. We teach them to use their time together wisely, communicating interest and attention with words and with actions. Many of our patients have closed themselves off from others, however, especially if their pain is long-standing. It takes time and courage to open up again. How about you? Do you feel that you do not want to \"bother\" others with your problems? Do you want understanding and support from others but are afraid or embarrassed to have to ask for help? Do you like to give, but have difficulty receiving? When you have done a great deal for others, do you feel especially let down when you get little in return? Do you find yourself being irritable with others, barking orders when you cannot bear to ask for things? Do you act as though all is well and hide your feelings until a final drop causes the bucket to overflow? Does the straw that broke the camel\\'s back lead you to let out all your emotions in one burst? The answer \"yes\" to any of these questions is a wall that you may have built to protect yourself. This need to protect yourself is understandable, but you may also be harboring a deep longing for others to break down these walls that you have created. When they don\\'t, you may feel that you have to protect yourself even more. Your family and friends are likely confused and at times hurt by your behavior (e.g., a sudden outburst of emotion). It is likely that, like Rita, you feel ashamed, confused, and hurt after an outburst as well. You may then seek to get yourself \"back in control\" of your feelings. Others may not dare to discuss what has happened. Like you, they try to act as if nothing is wrong. Few people know how to handle so many intense and confused feelings, either in themselves or in others. (Remember how Rita\\'s family responded to her?) Your friends and family may Don\\'t Let Pain Ruin Your Relationships! 97 feel as inadequate and helpless as you do at times. They may not know how to respond and how to be supportive. Most people hope that problems in relationships will disappear on their own. The problem is, they never do. The only way to solve this problem is to learn to communicate better. Decoding Communication Problems What are some common problems in communication? Most problems communicating involve the following: 1. A mismatch between what you say and what you want to say. For example, saying that you \"want everyone to go away\" when what you really need is either comfort or just a little bit of time to yourself. 2. Resistance or confusion about making requests. You may communicate passively (e.g., through body language) and deny your feelings (even to yourself). Or you may communicate aggressively and defensively, thus hurting others\\' feelings and not respecting their needs. 3. Difficulty in active listening to what others are trying to communicate. You may listen but not really hear what is being said. 4. Making excessive demands, emphasizing dependency, and being dishonest. Out of frustration, you may regress to a more childlike state in which you expect people to read your mind. When we are in pain, we may think that people close to us should understand how we feel, should know what we want, or should know what to do. When they don\\'t, we may resort to manipulation. Notice that we have said \"you\" or \"we\" throughout. This is because change starts with the person most motivated to change. And that is most likely the person in the most pain you. Others in your life may have just as much difficulty communicating, but you cannot control them. The only person you can control is yourself. However, asking why others are not sensitive to your pain is a reasonable question. It may help to think about the following. First, chronic pain is invisible. That is, a person with chronic pain may look quite healthy outwardly but feel miserable on the inside. The inconsistency between appearances and feelings makes communication especially complicated. For example, as a result of your pain, you may have a number of limitations. This has consequences for other people in your life, who need to know about these. If you \"look\" fine, other people will automatically assume that your pain is getting better. So, you need to tell them clearly what your limitations are. Particularly in the case of chronic pain, people may need to be told more than once what you are able and not able to do. 98 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Second, people may seem insensitive because it is difficult for them to know what they should or should not do, when to offer help, and when to back off. Men, in particular, may be confused about this. In modern society, most men have been socialized not to notice when others need help. They often do not want to notice when they themselves need help. For example, think of the times a man will drive around lost for an hour before asking for help. Most people assume that he doesn\\'t want to ask for help. But part of the problem is that the man may not even be aware for a while that he needs help. Third, most people find it difficult to imagine that pain will not end or that it will be a constant companion. Most people are capable of imagining what it means to be dependent on a wheelchair to get around. Those who have difficulty imagining this can spend a day in a wheelchair and they will then know what it\\'s like. (Although it\\'s never really the same, because at the end of the day the person trying out the wheelchair knows that he or she can get up and walk.) In the case of pain, particularly chronic pain, it\\'s very hard to put yourself in the shoes of another. This is because pain is personal and also because most people\\'s experience with their own pain is with temporary injuries. Unless they have experienced chronic pain, it is truly incomprehensible to them. Other reasons that people may seem to be insensitive to pain include the following. Other People\\'s Pain Is Not Interesting! Although you may feel left out of things because of your pain, although some days you wish you could make someone understand exactly what the pain feels like, many people are not naturally predisposed to hearing about this. Although it\\'s very frustrating when the other person doesn\\'t really seem interested in your pain, the hard fact of life is that fain is NOT that interesting unless it\\'s happening to you! It helps not to take this personally. When people are uninterested in your pain, it\\'s most often not that they\\'re not interested in you. They likely would not be interested in anyone else\\'s pain either. Other People Have Their Own Problems Many people do not wear their hearts on their sleeves. They may be preoccupied with their own problems, but often they do not admit this. Even in a marriage, people may not share their worries. Men, in particular, have often been taught not to talk about a problem until they have it solved. Also, most men have been trained to \"solve others\\' problems\" in a concrete way. If they can\\'t fix it, they often don\\'t know what to do. As a result, they may feel inadequate and helpless. Women too, may feel the need to keep a \"stiff upper lip\" or Don\\'t Let Pain Ruin Your Relationships! 99 to try to \"fix\" things. Most people don\\'t realize that simply listening to another is perhaps the greatest source of comfort there is. A related issue is that when you share your feelings of sadness, fear, or frustration, they may touch others\\' feelings of the same sort (e.g., anxiety over financial or work problems, sadness over an elderly parent\\'s ill health). If other people do not want their emotions to be touched by a discussion of yours, they may change the subject. If you continue to talk about your pain or associated emotions, they may remove themselves physically or emotionally from the conversation. Pain Is a Difficult Subject People usually like to avoid difficult topics, even if they have nothing negative going on in their own lives, and physical pain is a difficult subject (as is dying, being unemployed, etc.). People may also think if they talk about your pain, it will make things worse. Again, if you continue talking about it, they may tend to back away. But again, this has more to do with them than with you. Pain Is Not Constant You likely have noticed that some days your pain is better and other days it is worse. People outside of the home, however, tend to see you when things are going well and not when you are stuck in the house because of the pain. When people see you during a better day, they may quickly assume that you are \"better\" or that your ongoing pain is \"not that bad.\" You, on the other hand, know and possibly fear that there will be even worse days ahead, so you may feel a certain reluctance to tell others that you are feeling somewhat better. You are afraid that this will give you as well as your family and friends false hope. These anticipations can influence what you think and feel and do. We will return to this important issue later in this book. Pain Is Unpredictable Pain, as you know, does not always follow immediately after overexertion. It can be delayed, which is confusing to other people. They see you being very busy, and then a day or so later you are unable to do much at all. They are not sure what to expect of you. Only after they learn about the ups and downs of living with chronic pain can they understand. However, they may not be ready to learn this until better communication is established between you. 100 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Also, pain makes it difficult to plan ahead. People close to you may feel frustrated because they can never be quite sure what type of day you are likely to have, and they therefore can\\'t plan anything that includes you. People like to give to people they care about, and not being able to plan an outing for you may be as frustrating for them as it is for you. Pain Causes Negative Feelings As we have noted pain, fatigue, and limitations all produce negative emotions. Sometimes you give the message, \"Help me, don\\'t you see that I\\'m having a difficult time?\" while in an exactly comparable situation you may spitefully say, \"Don\\'t help me, let me take care of myself, do you think I can\\'t do anything anymore!\" How did Rita feel about her family\\'s responses to her? As we have illustrated, pain is a complicated topic that is very difficult to understand, not only by you but also by significant people in your life. It is a subject that people would rather avoid. Improving Communication Because of these difficulties in understanding chronic pain, learning to communicate well with others is particularly important. Most people have not been trained to communicate well, and most of the time, they \"get along\" pretty well anyway. However, when difficulties arise, problems in communication make things even worse. So if you have chronic pain, it is important to learn to be an excellent communicator. To begin this process, we have summarized a few basic guidelines for improving communication in Exhibit 5.1. Giving and Getting Respect In addition to these guidelines, it is important to understand the nature of giving and receiving respect. For example, lashing out or engaging in arguments that hurt or anger you or others may damage mutual respect. Expressing yourself appropriately assertively is one way to address this problem. Assertion involves standing up for personal rights and expressing your thoughts, feelings, and beliefs in direct, honest, and appropriate ways. The basic messages when you are communiDon\\'t Let Pain Ruin Your Relationships! 101 Exhibit 5.1. Guidelines for Improving Communication S Tell others respectfully what you can and cannot do. / Inform them that the severity of your pain varies, even if it is never completely gone. / Tell them in a friendly way what kind of help you hope to receive and why. J Tell them when they are helping! Praise wins over blame every time. J Do not be afraid to tell people when things are a bit better or a bit worse. / Try to be positive, despite the pain. A pleasant disposition can sometimes decrease pain at the same time it brings others closer to you. ^ Ask for understanding with regard to your difficult feelings about the pain and its consequences. Give a short answer to the question \"How are you feeling?\" Then show interest by inquiring as to how the other is doing. </ Talk to others regularly, not just when your pain is most intense. / Do not have an important discussion, make rash statements, or make important decisions when your pain is at its worst. S Do not use body language to indirectly communicate pain. Be direct and honest in telling people how you are feeling. Encourage others to express their feelings and to discuss them with you. S Do not feel guilty if the pain has a negative influence on your moods; this is normal. Try not to take things out on other people, however. / Work on accepting your present limitations while making efforts to improve. / Do not take the other person\\'s mildly negative behavior personally. Others\\' moods most often reflect their own personality or concerns. eating assertively are the following: \"this is what I think\"; \"this is what I feel\"; \"this is what I would like to happen.\" These messages express who you are, how you see the problem, and what you want to do about it. If they are communicated appropriately, they do not shame, humiliate, or put you or other people down. Two types of respect are involved in assertive communication: respect for oneself and respect for the other person. The following is an example of an assertive communication. A woman was desperately trying to get a flight to Kansas City to see her mother who was sick in the hospital. Weather conditions were bad and the lines were long. Having been rejected from three standby flights, she again found herself in the middle of a long line for the fourth and last flight to Kansas City. This time she approached a man who was standing near the beginning of the line and said, pointing to her place, 102 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE \"Would you mind exchanging places with me? I ordinarily wouldn\\'t ask, but it\\'s extremely important that I get to Kansas City tonight to be with my mother who is very ill.\" The man nodded yes. When asked what her reaction would have been if the man had refused, she replied, \"I would have been disappointed but it would have been OK. I hoped he would understand, but after all, he was there first.\" In this example the woman showed self-respect by asking whether the man would be willing to help her. Also, she respected the man\\'s right to refuse her request and not fulfill her need. Assertion, Nonassertion, and Aggression There are basically three ways to communicate to other people: assertively, nonassertively, and aggressively. The goal of assertion is clear communication and mutualityto give and receive respect, to play fair, and to leave room for compromise. In the case of compromise, neither person sacrifices the basic integrity of their needs (not wants). Most important, assertion is not simply a way of getting what one wants Nonassertion involves violating one\\'s own integrity by failing to express honest feelings, thoughts, and beliefs. For example, nonassertion is expressing one\\'s thoughts and feelings in an apologetic, self-effacing manner. It results in others not taking your needs seriously and may reflect that you don\\'t take your needs seriously either. Nonassertion also sometimes shows a subtle lack of respect for the other person\\'s ability to shoulder some responsibility and to refuse requests appropriately. Ultimately, the goal of nonassertion is to appease others and to avoid conflict. Aggression involves insisting on one\\'s personal rights in a way that is inappropriate and almost always violates the rights of the other person. The goal of aggression is to dominate and win. Tactics include humiliating and belittling or overpowering people so that they are less able to express and defend their needs and rights Exhibit 5-2 summarizes the differences between assertive, nonassertive, and aggressive communication. Behavior as Communication Your partner or best friend is usually the most important person in your life. He or she is also the one person other than you who is most directly affected by your physical condition. The chronic pain of one\\'s partner or close friend can cause extra strain on a relationship and Don\\'t Let Pain Ruin Your Relationships! 103 Exhibit 5.2. Comparing Nonassertive, Assertive, and Aggressive Behavior Feelings Your feelings when behaving this way The other person\\'s feelings about him or herself when you engage in this behavior The other person\\'s feelings about you when you engage in this behavior Characteristics of the behavior Nonassertive: emotionally dishonest, indirect, self-denying, inhibited Hurt, anxious at the time, and possibly angry later Superior, guilty if they take advantage of your nonassertion Pity, irritation, disgust Aggressive: inappropriate, self-enhancing at expense of another Righteous, superior, maybe feel a sense of relief at the moment, but possibly feel guilty later Hurt, humiliated, angry, usually later Angry, vengeful Assertive: appropriate, emotionally honest and direct, self- and otherenhancing, expressive Confident, selfrespecting, both in the moment and later Valued and respected Generally respectful communication skills. It\\'s a challenge, and it can cause both people to grow in strength and mutual respect if communication skills are enhanced. Other people, however, can behave in ways that unknowingly (on their part and possibly on yours) actually have a harmful influence on you. This is true even when they have the best of intentions. Sometimes your friend may be too understanding and sympathize too much with you (Type A, described below). Sometimes your partner is too afraid to show understanding out of fear that this will make you feel worse (Type B, described below). Just for the sake of understanding, we will portray both types in the most extreme manner. Most people do not 104 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE fit into \"type\" this dramatically, but you may recognize some characteristics of each type of person in the family and friends that you have. Type A Partner or Friend If your friend is the caring type, he or she may humor you as much as possible and shield you from things that you should be responsible for. They continually take everything out of your hands, believing they are protecting you. If you feel demeaned by this and suddenly get angry or even assert yourself, the Type A friend resignedly accepts your outbursts and may then be condescending. A Type A friend does not bother you with his or her own problems and instructs others (children, family, friends, neighbors) not to make their problems known to you. They may believe this is helpful \"training\" so these people will not upset you. When hearing you are in pain, these people will try to get you into bed as quickly as possible. They promptly bring you medication or call the doctor. A Type A friend may not like others to help you, because they feel that this might be an indication of personal failure on their part. They continually say, \"Let me do that.\" They act as if they very much want you to remain totally dependent on them. Obviously, we have painted an extreme caricature, but some of these characteristics may ring a bell. Type B Partner or Friend A Type B friend usually assumes that your pain cannot be as bad as you say. They cannot accept your losses in the areas of daily functioning and your feelings about these losses. They encourage you repeatedly to be strong (subtly suggesting that you are not). They often bring up other people in worse circumstances as examples. \"Think about the quadrapalegic who can\\'t even talk without mechanical assistance,\" they might say. They are also not above using themselves as an example. \"I\\'ve had pain too, but I didn\\'t let it get me down like you do.\" Especially when you want to rest during the day, they are critical. They may directly or indirectly suggest that you are giving in to the pain or, worse, that you are lazy. The Type B person ignores your needs for rest. Particularly when in the company of others, he or she may tell you not be a wimp (or a whiner). The message is loud and clear. You should just tough it out. When you are feeling upset, the Type B person makes it clear that you should not be so emotional or weak. They often refuse to comfort you when you need it. Sometimes a person will periodically swing from the Type A to the Type B pattern and back again. This is even more confusing. What is needed is a third type of significant other, a Type C. Don\\'t Let Pain Ruin Your Relationships! 105 Type C Partner or Friend Type C friends take your pain and your feelings seriously. They talk with you about ways they can or cannot be of help. They don\\'t offer more than they can do, and they assume you will arrange for other help if they\\'re not available. They do not treat you as a patient or as someone \"less than\" themselves but as an equal person with whom they can share both the good and the bad times in life. The Type C friend does not feel invulnerable to the kind of pain you are experiencing. This type of person understands that you will experience negative emotions as a result of your chronic pain, but they do not allow you to take it out on them. They express confidence that you can progress in managing your pain, without minimizing the effort involved. They listen and act as a sounding board rather than attempt to solve problems for you. When they face difficulties, they ask you to listen and be a sounding board as well. They share their own vulnerabilities and limits with you. Please note that this description is just as much of a caricature as our descriptions of Types A and B. Few people behave in a Type C manner in all ways and at all times. They have good and bad days as well. If you are in a partnership or friendship with someone who is a Type A or B, the most you can hope for is that they will grow and change to become more like Type C at least some of the time. But no one is perfect all of the time. And change, as you well know, takes time and effort. If your partner or friend is willing, you may wish to ask if they would read this section of the book after you have made a good-faith effort to communicate more effectively. You might use it as a way to begin a dialogue about the pain problem and how it mutually affects you both. Perhaps you may only learn about their feelings. This is okay for now, as long as your partner or friend is not disrespectful. They may have kept things in longer than you have, or they may have enacted their feelings in ways they are not proud of. You can model the patience that you hope they will have with you by accepting them where they are today. Intimacy Most people, especially women, but many men as well, know the importance of warm physical contact, especially when one is not feeling well. In any circumstances, such intimacy can help you to be your true self, feel appreciated, and feel safe. Unfortunately, in our society, physical contact can be threatening and may seem less natural than it really is. Couples in which one partner experiences chronic pain often experience difficulties in the area of sexual intimacy. Sexual intercourse, for example, may be more difficult and less pleasurable as a result of pain and fatigue. Both people may unintentionally avoid physical 106 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE contact. Also, people often do not have the same needs for physical intimacy at the same time. In the case of sexual intimacy, if one partner longs for tenderness and another for sexual intercourse, unless they understand this, they may reach an impasse. Fears of failure may disturb the kind of safe atmosphere that both partners need to be sexually intimate. For example, wanting to \"perform well\" and to give and receive orgasm can disrupt a night of romance. (Outside of physical intimacy, wanting to do well in your own eyes or in the eyes of the other can also seriously disrupt feelings of security and intimacy with the other person. In these cases, you may feel that you are doing something for the other instead of with him or her.) It takes really good communication skills to discuss sexuality and negotiate differences in needs for physical contact. A person must feel free to say no to something and to do so in a way that does not hurt the other. This is true in other areas as well. Because pain, tiredness, stress, and uncertainty now play a role in your life, what used to be pleasurable may no longer be so. For example, pain may limit the frequency of the outings you used to go on with a best friend. He or she may not be happy with this and could even be a bit miffed. Feeling free to say no without feeling guilty, even when the other person feels frustrated and takes it personally, is quite a feat. Still, it is vitally important that everyone learns to do this, because doing \"yes\" and thinking \"no\" (play-acting) causes tension and may boomerang in other areas of a relationship. Ultimately, it may result in a relationship ending and getting stalled at a superficial level. Being Romantic Being romantic may feel like the furthest thing from the mind of a person in pain. But if you make your wishes clear, you may find it relaxing and comforting to be in the intimate company of a person with whom you can be your true self. Being romantic does not necessarily mean being sexual, but it does go beyond friendship. Being romantic may or may not lead to sexual intimacy. Many people find it romantic to be near a fireplace in winter, to listen to soft music, to have a favorite beverage, to share a favorite film. Others find sharing a big easy chair or comfy couch and holding hands romantic. What is romantic to one person, however, may not be romantic to the other. One of our patients finds it romantic to wash and dry the dishes with her husband. Her husband feels like this is simply sharing a chore. On the other hand, he feels running errands together is romantic, whereas she feels it is quite stressful. They have to find a mutual ground where both feel relaxed in each other\\'s company and in which closeness can happen naturally. By itself, warm, safe bodily contact can have a relaxing influence. Tender touch, caressing, nestling safely with each other can all bring feelings of safety and relaxation. It can be a relief Don\\'t Let Pain Ruin Your Relationships! 107 (if not necessarily relaxing the first time) when two people try to openly, honestly, and confidentially explain to each other (sometimes with words, sometimes without) what they find relaxing and what they don\\'t when they are together. When there is respect for each other\\'s preferences and values, when there is no shaming, and when communication is open, trust in the other person grows, and clarity and understanding result. In any relationship, both people need to pay attention to what the other enjoys. Neither person bears responsibility for the quality of the entire relationship. Both must find the time (or make the time) and practice patience in learning to communicate and further intimacy in ways that help the relationship grow. Relationship Maintenance Just as a car\\'s engine will burn up if the oil is not changed and replenished, relationships need tune-ups and daily maintenance. These relationship-maintenance steps help both people to act in ways that help the other and create intimacy. Here are some basic maintenance steps to keep in mind: + Remember to balance your immediate needs with the needs of the long-term relationship. ^ Be gentle when you talk and when you touch. ^ Be courteous and kind in your actions. + Express frustration and anger directly, with sensitivity to timing. Don\\'t attack or act in a passiveaggressive way. + Don\\'t allow yourself to be threatened, and make no threats to the other person. Be able to tolerate a \"no\" to requests that you make of another person, and understand that you also have the right to say no. + Try not to judge your significant other when they are not at their best. Perhaps they have reasons completely aside from the relationship for being disagreeable to a request. Avoid thinking (much less saying), \"If she loved me she would ... If he were a good person, he would . . .\" Even internal monologues of this sort can bring you down. ^ Listen and be genuinely interested in the other person\\'s point of view. ^ Try not to interrupt or,talk over the person. ^ Acknowledge and validate the other person\\'s feelings, wants, and difficulties. ^ Use appropriate humor to help each other get over the rough spots that occur in any relationship. While you are reading these suggestions, you might be thinking that it would be great if your significant other would read and heed them. But remember, people change more by 108 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE example than they do by a lecture. And someone has to start first (usually the most motivated person in the relationship). Also keep in mind that even when you model these qualities consistently over time, it is unlikely that things will change immediately in your relationship. Troubles in a relationship take time to harden and they take time to melt. Summary There is a great deal of ignorance in today\\'s world about the subject of pain, and about chronic pain in particular. Therefore, it may be difficult to find people who automatically understand your situation. The suggestions made in this lesson have the potential to help remedy this situation by helping you understand other people and teaching some of the basics of effective communication. Even if no one but you changes, at the very least you will like looking at yourself in the mirror more if you put some of these suggestions into practice. And the person who looks back at you in the mirror is the person whose opinion of you counts the most. Activities That Can Help Critical Activities 1. Covert communication exercise. The following practice exercise may be useful in helping you to describe your pain problem to important family members and friends who may be concerned and possibly confused. A, Assume that you are out to dinner with a partner or significant other and you are having a significant increase in pain. Your significant other sees the grimace on your face and asks you what is wrong. What do you say? Write the answer in your journal or notebook. B. Identify what it is that you want from this imaginary interaction with your significant other. Would you say this any differently? Do you want your friend to listen, to offer you some reassurance, to offer you some advice, or to offer you some assistance? In your journal or notebook, try rewriting your first sentence to include a clear request for what you may want from the interaction. Don\\'t Let Pain Ruin Your Relationships! 109 C. What kind of different response do you think that you might get after having rephrased the question to more accurately reflect what you want from the interaction? 2. Refer to the suggestions in Exhibit 5.1 at least once each time you anticipate interacting with other people over a period of a week. Did you see any changes in your behavior or communication style from how you normally behave or communicate? Write down what you noticed in your notebook or journal. 3. How does your partner know that you are in pain? Ask him or her to see if you are on the same page. 4. Arrange a time to discuss your thoughts, feelings, and preferences with someone important to you. It might be best to do this on one of your better days, when your pain is less severe than usual. Write down a day and time to do this here Write down a second date and time ( ) in case you are not able to have this discussion or you feel you should spend more time in this discussion. How did they react to your request for a discussion? How did the conversation go? How do you feel now that you\\'ve had this discussion? Are there other things you would like to say to those close to you? If yes, write them down in your notebook or journal. 5. Complete the assessment listed in Appendix 5.1. Optional Activities 6. Pick out a difficult situation that recurs in your relationship with someone. Describe the situation and then outline how you might want to express or assert yourself differently in the future and how you might reinforce helpful behavior on the part of the other. Your difficult situation DESCRIBE EXPRESS ASSERT REINFORCE 110 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE 7. Questions to consider. ^ What do you need most when you are in pain? ^ Is your partner or significant other best described as Type A, Type B, or Type C? + Which type do you consider yourself to be? Appendix 5.1 Pain Rating System After you have completed the first four critical tasks in this lesson, you will be more than halfway through the program. This will be a good point to return to some of the ratings we included at the end of the first lesson. Please answer each of the questions below. Do not go back and look at your responses you provided after lesson 1. Just make the ratings at this point. Later, we will suggest you go back and compare your response at different points along the program, but do not go back now. By the end of the program, we expect that you will see changes and improvements. Living with pain is a process, not an outcome. We are confident that with continued effort you will see positive changes occurring in your life. If you have not already done so, please photocopy the next page, date it, and put it in your journal or notebook. Don\\'t Let Pain Ruin Your Relationships! Ill 1.

Jerome Bruner ^^/ uite naturally, people with chronic pain want to gain control over their pain and ^^^^^their lives. In other words, they don\\'t want to be dependent on their pain. That has been a message repeated throughout this book. But do you really know what it means to be dependent on your pain? You are dependent (i.e., not in control of) on your pain when you allow the amount and severity of your pain to determine + what you do and how long you do it;^ whether you rest and how long you rest; ^ how your mood is; + whether you take medication and how much; + whether you ask for help; and ^ with whom you socialize. On the other hand, you can become more independent of your pain if you choose to change your behavior. Knowing what to change and actually doing it are two very different things, as you well know. Often, what we want to do is undermined by habits of which we\\'re not even aware. To change these patterns, we begin by learning to recognize what factors negatively affect our behavior and what factors are most likely to help us change. We call these the laws of learning. In this lesson, we will show you how your life and your pain are influenced by the attention you give to certain behaviors. Most important, we will show how to change this attention pattern to increase confidence and gain independence from your pain to an extent you never dreamed possible. 114 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Reward Desirable Behavior! The most important law of learning is that all behavior is influenced by the consequences of the behavior (i.e., the results or responses that follow from behavior), whether these consequences are self-induced or are the result of the behavior of others. Typically, if the consequences are positive, the behavior (good or not so good) will increase and continue. If the results are negative, the behavior will decrease or will not recur. In other words, if you do something and that action is followed by something you like (i.e., a positive reward), it is more likely that you will perform the same or similar actions in the same or similar situations. All of us hope to continue to enjoy positive or desirable outcomes. If you do something that is followed by something you do not like, you will be less likely to perform the same or similar action again in the same or similar circumstances. You\\'ve probably heard the adage \"the squeaky wheel always gets the grease.\" However, you may not be aware of how you are greasing your own squeaky wheels and ignoring the ones that are quiet. That is because most habitual behavior becomes less and less conscious over time. Also, others in your environment may, out of habit, reward undesirable behaviors (i.e., those that keep you stuck) and ignore desirable behaviors (those that could help you become freer). But let\\'s begin by considering a fairly common example that has nothing to do with pain per se but that illustrates these laws of learning. Five-year old Katy wants her mother to buy her some new boots with shockingly bright (neon orange and green on black background) colors. Her mother says \"No,\" and explains that these boots do not match her pink coat or that they are too expensive, or she may even say both things. Katy keeps asking her mother for the boots and refuses to consider any of the other pairs in the store. Her mother repeats her earlier remarks and tells her to select another pair that will better match her coat. Katy now starts to cry loudly, making quite a scene in the store. Her mother tries to soothe and quiet her, but to no avail. Katy\\'s behavior becomes even more extreme, and she finally throws a full-blown temper tantrum. What is it likely her mother will do? You have likely witnessed such situations or perhaps been in them yourself, either as a child or a parent, grandparent, or guardian. If you were the parent, you may have given in. You were tired, the boots weren\\'t that expensive, and someone was waiting for you. Whatever the circumstances, we have all been guilty of giving in to inappropriate behavior at some point, some of us more so than others. The important question for our purposes is, if the parent gives in, What has Katy learned from her experience with the boots? She has begun to grasp, perhaps even without words, that if she behaves badly in front of others she is more likely to get what she wants. That may Changing Behavior 115 not have been the initial intention of her tantrum (she may have been very hungry and tired). But her tantrum produced a desired outcomeshe obtained the boots she wanted. The next time she wants something that her parent is against, she may begin, consciously or unconsciously, to enact the same behavior that won her the boots. If she is successful in this or other attempts to have more power than a little girl should have, the negative behavior will become even more deeply ingrained. Note that we are not saying that Katy is a \"bad girl\" but that learning experiences are powerful reinforcements of behavior. The more behaviors are reinforced, the more difficult they are to change. Now let\\'s consider the complementary learning lessonpunishing desirable behavior. Why and how would anyone try to punish (and thereby reduce the frequency of) desirable behavior? No one really does this consciously. However, we do it all the time when we focus on what is wrong and ignore what is right. Another way of putting it is that we pay attention to our own or other\\'s behaviors in a selective fashion. This is a much more difficult-to-undo learning experience, and it occurs whenever desirable behavior may be \"expected\" and receives no attention. Desirable behavior is, in effect, taken for granted. In the long run, behavior that receives no attention (i.e., behavior that is ignored) often disappears without anyone knowing why. Again, let\\'s look at a child, this time in his home environment. Six-year-old Kenny is quietly playing with his toys, and his father is quietly going about his business, either relieved that no more demands are being made of him (he has had a tough day) or perhaps simply not wishing to interfere with his son\\'s age-appropriate play behavior. Kenny\\'s father feels that all is going well. He does not notice Kenny looking up at him from time to time. After a while Kenny gives up on his father and turns on the television. Kenny\\'s desirable behavior, namely, playing quietly, received no attention or reward from his father. In effect, he was ignored. However, we can by now guess that if he whined, he would likely get some attention, even if it was negative. For children who are feeling ignored, bad attention is better than no attention at all. Is Kenny\\'s father a bad parent? No. Is he behaving in a way that will increase his son\\'s desirable behavior in the future? The answer here is \"no\" as well. Unfortunately, by the time we reach adulthood, we have learned from others not to be attentive to well-running wheels, others\\' or most especially our own. We tend to enact this behavior with our children. Attention: A Natural Need All people need attention, adults as well as children. We especially need the good but takenfor- granted side of ourselves to be \"seen\" by others, or we will begin to show our other side. 116 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE It is human nature to attempt to see ourselves in the eyes of the ones we love, and if we can only see ourselves in their eyes when we practice certain negative behaviors, it is those behaviors that will become patterns in our lives. This occurs most often without conscious awareness. As a parent, for example, you try to be consistent. You systematically try to reward good behavior and punish bad behavior. But does that actually happen as often as you would like? In the examples of the children Katy and Kenny, you can observe the laws of learning in action. In both cases providing a rewardboots or attentionwill likely increase the child\\'s behavior. In Kenny\\'s case, the failure to provide attention (a reward) for positive behavior will likely lead to reduction in appropriate behavior. In these ways, reinforcement can lead to the increase in negative behavior and a decrease in positive behavior. Let\\'s see how this works with adults, by considering Sandra and Dennis, a married couple. Dennis likes reading his newspaper and watching TV every night. He only half listens to his wife, Sandra, as she tries to tell him about her day. Without meaning to, his behavior is telling her that what she has to say is less interesting and important than the TV or newspaper. When Sandra asks Dennis to pay attention to her, he either ignores her or behaves as if she is being childish. Sandra may respond to Dennis\\'s behavior in several ways. She may grumble under her breath, she may get angry outwardly, or she may unconsciously forget to give him an important telephone message. She may not be aware of any of these responses or she may be aware of some. Assume that none of Sandra\\' efforts are successful, and Dennis continues to be unresponsive to her efforts to gain his attention. In desperation, Sandra announces that she wants a divorce and begins packing her bags. Suddenly, she has Dennis\\'s attention. Dennis does not want a divorce. He changes immediately, and suddenly he is ready to give Sandra his undivided attention. He promises to read less and to pay more attention to Sandra, and he brings her flowers the next day. What has Sandra learned from this experience? She observes that only when she takes extreme measures (not quite tantrums, as in the example of Katy, but the result is the same) will Dennis respond in the way she wishes. Packing her bags was followed by the desired outcome (Dennis\\'s undivided attention). Remember, behavior that produces a desirable outcome will be repeateda basic law of learning. What do you think Sandra will be likely to do the next time Dennis is inattentive? Now let\\'s consider another example. Don hurt his back on the job several years ago. His severe pain has affected all parts of his life. He mostly sits in his lounge chair watching TV during the day and stays in bed watching TV at night. He visited a physical therapist who developed an exercise plan for him, making use of the principles of pacing. But every time Don tried the exercises he felt that his pain became worse, and he feared that the exercises recommended would cause more serious damage to his back. Changing Behavior 117 So whenever he started to be active, he used the first sign of pain to lie down. When he did, his pain seemed somewhat reduced. This example shows how we can produce what we think are \"desirable outcomes\" by ourselves. What has Don learned from his experience? Several things: \"If it hurts, don\\'t do it\"; \"Exercise causes pain, so don\\'t do it\"; and, \"If I stop exercising and lie down, my pain is relieved. So stop at any sign of pain.\" He has also come to associate activity with pain. Now, even if physical therapy is mentioned, his back starts to act up. It is like the famous dog that Pavlov taught to salivate at the sound of a bell because that sound was previously associated with getting fed. Pavlov\\'s dog wasn\\'t neurotic. He had simply learned to anticipate and to expect food when he heard a bell. Then even when no food was actually present and the light came on, he salivated. The dog and Don learned to expect something to happen on the basis of previous learning. What impact do you think Don\\'s experience will have on his general behavior? As you might expect, he will become more and more inactive. The more he is inactive, the more he loses muscle strength, flexibility, and endurance. Thus, another vicious circle is created. Learning to avoid something, like activity, to prevent an undesired outcome is referred to as the law of avoidance learning. It is a variant of the first law of learning (i.e., that all behavior is influenced by the consequences of that behavior). In the case of chronic pain, learning to anticipate undesired outcomes (e.g., pain) will cause one to avoid healthy behavior (e.g., staying active). Exhibit 6.1 summarizes behavior based on both laws of learning presented in this lesson in case examples. Rewards are considered positive reinforcement, whereas undesired outcomes are considered negative reinforcement. Exhibit 6.1.

On the positive side, when we look for the good characteristics in others and give attention to these positive elements in our relationships, these relationships will steadily become stronger and closer. That\\'s what tends to happen when one rewards the positive behaviors in relationships by giving them more attention. On the other hand, if we are continually busy discovering faults in others (our partner, colleagues, boss, or children) and if we criticize or attack others frequently, we negatively reinforce their experience of being around us. Thus, if we reward negative behavior by giving it attention, we\\'ll find that our relationships gradually or rapidly become less satisfying. For some people, complaints of pain get more and more attention, and this attention influences their behavior in a negative way. For others, feeling pain and maintaining a positive disposition may well be ignored (remember how the squeaky wheel gets the grease). Therefore, people who didn\\'t complain at first about their pain may begin to talk about it or show more and more nonverbal signs of suffering. This illustrates a principle that was learned when scientists studied abused children. Negative attention is experienced as better than no attention at all. That is part of why abused children often want to return to their homes after they are in foster care. In foster care, where there are many children, they are often ignored. At home, at least they got attention, even if it was painful. We were all little children once, and we still need attention as adults. Negative attention may be unpleasant, but when we receive no attention, we feel as if we might wither and die. That\\'s why it\\'s natural, although counterproductive, for an adult to seek attention through talking and complaining about pain. The key is to try to find ways to receive needed attention without reinforcing one\\'s own sense of suffering and perhaps driving others away. By way of review, we have summarized the behavioral principles behind the laws of learning in Exhibit 6.2 Inappropriate Attention We have seen that attention has a strong power to influence behavior. But specifically, what kinds of attention are desirable and undesirable when it comes to chronic pain? Is it good to give your pain as much attention as possible, or is it better to ignore it? You may be surprised by the answers. Changing Behavior 119 Exhibit 6.2. Summary of the Laws of Learning Probability of the Schedule Consequences behavior recurring Positive reinforcement Reward the behavior More likely Negative reinforcement Prevent or withdraw, avoidance More likely Punishment With negative emotions and much attention More likely Punishment With little attention, ignoring the behavior Less likely Neglect Prevent or withdraw positive results Less likely Doctor Shopping Doctors often unwittingly reinforce pain by paying particular attention to increased reporting of pain. The more pain reported, the more attention they give to the patient. The opposite is also true. When people report a reduction of pain, they often receive less attention from their physician. This may have unfortunate results. When a doctor or therapy no longer provides attention, patients may begin to think about repeating diagnostic tests or searching out new therapies or physicians. Pinning one\\'s hopes on a physician or treatment is natural in the beginning. It decreases feelings of aloneness and engenders hope. However, although new doctors or new treatments may generate hope at first, they may then lead to deeper feelings of hopelessness or a frantic search for other options as relief of chronic pain is not realized. Continued doctor and treatment shopping will eventually bring about increasingly more despair because false hopes and attention will not in themselves reduce pain. On the other hand, some people with chronic pain stay with the same physician, but they become dependent on him or her for too long a time. This results in a fearful dependence and uncertainty, often followed by lack of hope, frustration, and distress. If the distress brings about attention at that point, they may receive a lot of negative reinforcement for emphasizing their pain. Only the right kind of attention can take one\\'s mind off pain and focus it toward more productive areas. Think about your own experiences. How many specialists have you sought out? How many medications, treatments, and surgeries have you received? How did you feel when a new treatment was recommended? If your hopes were dashed, how did you feel? Endless searching for \"something new\" will also interfere with attempts at self-management of pain. For example, many products and treatments hold out promises of relief. But do 120 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE their sponsors have any real evidence to back up their claims? We\\'re not talking about personal testimonials or advertisements, but clear scientific proof. Not 9 out of 10 doctors, but real data. Searching after unproven treatments takes time away from learning proven methods that are helpful in reducing both pain and distress and in leading to a better life. At some point, all of us must accept ownership of our lives. If you have gotten this far in the book, you have begun this journey with regard to your pain. Over time, you will see the benefits in your experience of pain, in your ability to enjoy activities, and in your relationships with other people. Trying to Fool All of the People All of the Time Some people try to hide the pain. They think that hiding the pain causes less suffering to those around them. After all, putting on a false positive face may reduce unwanted questions and undesired attention. Too much attention may become annoying and painful itself. However, the idea that it is helpful to hide the pain all the time is incorrect. Denying a part of reality (the pain) means that you continually have to play a false role, that you continually have to walk on eggshellsin short, that you can never be yourself. Covering up takes a lot of energy. Trying to fool all the people all of the time is exhausting. But wait a minute, you might say! Wasn\\'t the first part of this lesson devoted to the hidden costs of bringing others\\' attention to your pain? Yes, that is true. That is where our emphasis was. But you may remember that we also discussed the benefits of sharing, open and honest communication, and obtaining and giving the right kind and amount of attention. First, you need some attention with regard to your suffering. Without some validation of your pain by someone or by not allowing yourself to receive appropriate attention, you may actually be spending more of your own attention on your pain. This then accentuates your experience of pain. What is needed is to be honestly open about your pain and limitations with appropriate people at appropriate times. That is, you need to let the right someone in on what you are truly experiencing, someone with whom you can be your real self. If you have no one in your life at this time who fits that bill, share your feelings with God, a higher power, or even the \"benign universe.\" Accentuating the Negative As we discussed before, the squeaky wheels in our lives get the grease, not only from others but, more important, from ourselves. This is partly because when things are going well, we quickly consider the positive to be normal. Anything outside of this automatically receives our attention. Remember a time when you had a bad cold. For a few days after the cold had passed, you felt grateful for the fact that you could breathe normally, that your nose wasn\\'t raw, and that your chest didn\\'t feel tight. You felt grateful to be able to do all the normal things that Changing Behavior 121 you took for granted. After a while, however, you forgot what it was like to have a cold, and breathing easily felt normal again. Chronic pain, by its very nature, does not go away like a cold. So it is easy to get stuck on focusing on the negativethe pain. This naturally leads to negative thoughts and emotions. We are not telling you to deny your pain. What we are saying is that if you give it more attention than it is due, you end up paying a double price for your pain. You not only have the pain you started out with, but now you have more negative emotions, more negative thoughts, and an intensified experience of pain. Think for a moment about all of the distressing emotions humans can feel: anger, fear, depression, shame, guilt, jealousy, sadness, embarrassment, and annoyance, to name just a few. Now, think for a moment of all the pleasurable emotions humans can feel. Were you able to come up with as many? Most people, when asked to think about it, can name more negative emotions than positive ones. It takes work to focus on positive emotions Think again about your body. When it was functioning properly, you may have hardly given it a thought. Most healthy people do not pay much attention to their bodies unless they are trying to lose weight or are temporarily ill. Acknowledge to yourself not only when you are in pain but also when you have a good day or even when you feel just a bit better in one part of your body. Try to appreciate this and whatever other positive emotions you may feel. On good days (and on very bad days) try focusing on what you can do or what you have, such as moving more easily or having a varied daily schedule. Try to focus on the small thingsa smile from the mailman or a phone call from a friend. And don\\'t be afraid to admit to yourself when you feel better, physically or emotionally. It will not \"jinx\" your improvement. It won\\'t give you false hope unless you tell yourself that \"now, I\\'m well for good.\" As in most things, it\\'s best to take one day at a time. On bad days, you may want to focus more on the parts of your body that function well, quietly stimulating and activating them. This can start a cycle of feeling a bit better, leading to more pleasant emotions and positive behaviors and feeling even better. On any day (good or bad), you can focus on the healthy parts of your body, perhaps using the relaxation exercises described in lesson 3. These areas of your body deserve as much of your attention as your pain. Appropriate Attention You now know that when you pay attention to positive (healthy) behavior, that act is already a positive step. What\\'s important next is to recognize the ways in which you can use your attention effectively as a reward to achieve positive results for yourself and for others. 122 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Four factors determine the effectiveness of any reward: desirability (how positive the reward is to you or another person), timing (how close the reward is to the behavior that is to be reinforced), frequency (how often), and predictability. The reward is most effective if it is (a) something that is desired by you or someone else, (b) provided as soon as possible after the desirable behavior, (c) given frequently, and (d) timed in an unpredictable way. Desired Rewards Whatever the reward is, it must be viewed favorably by the person to whom it is directed. For example, if you gave someone a box of candy as a reward and they were on a diet, the reward might not be desired. In the case of pain, someone who tells you to take it easy because you do not \"look good today\" might not be rewarding you if you are trying to do more and to build up your strength. To be positive, the reward, whether attention or some tangible object, needs to be something that the recipient wishes to receive. The more desirable it is, the more motivating. Prompt Rewards The reward is most effective if it follows the behavior to be reinforced closely in time. This may be more apparent if we use alcohol and the potential alcoholic to illustrate. The potential alcoholic individual taking his or her first drink often experiences a reduction in anxiety and worry and an increase in relaxation and sociability as a result of the alcohol. Drinking is thus immediately positively rewarded by these desirable feelings. In fact, anticipating these positive feelings may lead to drinking the next day and the day after that. If a person becomes an alcoholic, he or she may experience many negative consequences later on in the disease process (e.g., loss of job, family, prestige). However, the initial feeling of pleasure that is reinforced soon after a drink may be much more influential than these negative consequences in determining how difficult it is for the alcoholic to quit. When people with alcoholism are sober, they may be very aware of the losses involved in their disease process and may feel miserable, guilty, and ashamed. Also, when sober, the alcoholic person may feel that people and situations in his or her environment are punishing, therefore negatively reinforcing the state of being sober. However, as soon as he or she takes a drink, these undesirable emotions and punishments seem to fade away. Problems are soon forgotten, and only the present state of alcoholic relief countsnot yesterday and certainly not tomorrow. The same can be true for chronic pain. You may feel relatively worthless one day because you have done so little, according to your standards. Then, you feel somewhat better the next day, so you overdo it to make up for the \"perceived lack\" in yourself yesterday. During the activity you may feel fairly well. You taste the satisfaction of being occupied, there is diversion, and there is often a visible result. You feel somewhat better about yourself as a result. So, what\\'s the catch? Changing Behavior 123 The catch is that you are not punished immediately for doing too much, or for doing it too long. The pain typically comes later, the next day or the day after that. It is only then that you discover that you have gone beyond your limitations. The link between behavior and punishment is too far apart in time to be helpful. Progressing too fast in your activity plan or staying active until you are in pain and are fatigued will feel like a delayed sunburn after enjoying the sun. Or more subtly, if you stop your activities and rest after a certain amount of pain, then rest will be the inadvertent reward that follows a certain level of pain. Strangely enough, this will cause that pain level to occur earlier and more often. This is because something good only happens when you feel the pain is extreme, namely, the body receives rest and/or medication. If prescription painkillers are used, then this can surely be a reward for experiencing pain. Along the same lines, perhaps you are only able to ask for attention and help when you feel the pain forces you to do so. In this manner you will become steadily more dependent on severe pain to give you the opportunity to ask for help or to get needed attention. Maybe you think, \"I\\'m a real fighter. I don\\'t complain and I don\\'t give up quickly. I continue until I can\\'t go on any more. I only stop if the pain and tiredness force me to. I only take medicines when I really can\\'t stand the pain and need them.\" If you only rest and take appropriate medicines when you absolutely need to, then you are setting yourself up for failure. Like the alcoholic who only drinks when he or she \"needs to,\" you may be striding straight toward dependence on pain to bring you needed relief. So with regard to medication, if your doctor has prescribed pain medication and you have pain most of the time, it is usually best to take it at regular times each day rather than only when your pain is at its worst. If you take pain medication only when your pain is at its worst, you inadvertently reinforce that medication is a positive reward for pain. This may actually increase the amount of pain you feel! In summary, pain medication, rest, and attention should not be directly linked to a certain amount of pain. You should get rest, attention, and help even when your pain is less severe. Frequent Rewards Small rewards given frequently tend to work better than a large reward promised in the distant future. Using a parent-child example again to illustrate, sometimes parents promise their child at the beginning of the new school year that they will buy them a much-desired bicycle or computer game if they get all As at the end of the semester. The parents are usually surprised to see that for most children, this incentive has little to no influence at all on daily study behavior. Smaller but more frequent rewards tend to be more motivating for consistent study behavior (e.g., going to the movies or receiving a small amount of money or a small toy at the end of the week). Then, the reward will be closer in time, more frequent, and more linked to the efforts made during the week. 124 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE You, too, can only move forward by gradual but persistent effort and a willingness to stick with your self-management plan. Give yourself special attention or rewards for your efforts frequently, even when you don\\'t see objective evidence of \"success.\" In the same vein, try not to dwell for too long on inevitable setbacks. (Some setbacks are to be expected. Most successful nonsmokers tried at least three times before they succeeded in quitting smoking for good.) Remember, you learned to walk and to ride a bike only by falling down and getting up again. In short, you can have long-term goals, but progress will come more quickly if you strive toward limited goals over the short term and reinforce effort and small successes along the way to longer term goals. It also helps if your partner and other significant people in your life understand your self-management plan and provide encouragement and positive support for your efforts and small successes. It would probably also be best if they paid little attention to any setbacks that naturally occur. We stress this because too often our patients become critical of themselves when they have not achieved their long-term goals as soon as they thought they would. Keeping the kind of progress charts we described in lesson 2 can provide you with immediate feedback on your efforts. Over time, you can see where you started and where you are now. For example, you can see that you started being able to walk 5 minutes and now you can walk 12 minutes. This is success! Perhaps you used to be active around the house 10 minutes three times a day, and now you are active 20 minutes three times a day. This is success! Most important, however, you will see how you have been active in taking charge of your pain and your life. Unpredictable Rewards Probably the most surprising thing you will read in this lesson is that rewards are most effective when they are not totally predictable. As mentioned earlier, regular gamblers get \"hooked\" because they are rewarded in an unpredictable manner (e.g., \"One more try on this slot machine and I\\'ll win.\"). One factor that may account for the appeal of fishing is that is that you do not know exactly when or if you are going to catch a fish. Even presents that are unexpected tend to be more appreciated than predictable presents on fixed dates. This is also true in a relationship. One couple we know gives each other unexpected presents throughout the year instead of on birthdays and Christmas. They then enjoy the birthdays and holidays without the tension that sometimes surrounds these occasions. Remember the example of Dennis and Sandra earlier in this lesson? What we did not mention is that after learning that Sandra needed positive attention, Dennis started to bring her flowers every Friday. At first, Sandra was delighted. Over time, however, bringing flowers on Friday became routine. Sandra would even forget to notice that that Dennis had brought flowers home. The predictability of the reward had led to it being less rewarding. Now, anyone who\\'s been in a relationship knows that if Dennis stopped bringing Sandra flowers, Changing Behavior 125 she would likely be hurt. Perhaps a fight would ensue. At the very least, Dennis would likely hear, in an obvious or subtle accusatory voice, \"Why didn\\'t you bring any flowers?\" Thus, failure to do what comes to be expected often creates problems in a relationship. However, a certain amount of unpredictability is desirable, not only in our daily lives but also in our relationships. It is true that a certain amount of predictability provides comfort and order. But progress and other good things in life need surprise rewards; otherwise they have a tendency to disappear. If you have raised children, you may have learned (or are learning) that unpredictable rewarding of undesirable behavior makes this behavior the most stubborn and difficult to change. If a child misbehaves and sometimes you give him or her a time-out and sometimes you don\\'t, the misbehavior is likely to continue and increase in frequency. The unpredictable nature of pain often causes people with chronic pain to gamble with their activity and rest routines. They may even rely on \"Lady Luck.\" One day they feel well, so they think they are lucky and do a lot. A day or two later, they feel bad and rest all day, thinking, \"Tomorrow I may be lucky again.\" In the world of pain, however, gambling in this way only leads to loss. Preparing for Behavioral Change As people with chronic pain begin to consider behavioral changes, one problem they often face is that some of their previous behaviors were \"rewarding\" in the short term. That is, passivity, avoidance behavior, sleeping pills, and so on provided immediate rewards, so it was easy to become hooked on these illusory charms. These rewards may even continue to periodically occur over the long term because of what is known as the placebo effectthe mind thinks the unhealthy actions or inactions are working (even when they are not), and so the person is tricked into thinking he or she feels better as a result. The second problem you may face as you begin to change your behavior is that you may feel \"punished\" almost immediately. Everyone feels a degree of discomfort or distress when he or she first begins to change (whether this be activityrest cycles, relationship changes, or dietary changes). You will likely feel this, too, at first. We ask that you persevere consistently for at least 6 weeks. Research has shown that it takes consistent change for 6 weeks before people (a) see progress and (b) feel natural with regard to the change. Our patients have taught us that the distress or discomfort felt in the beginning of change is heavily outweighed by the rewards of consistency over time. They also have told us that they could tolerate a lot of discomfort at first when they believed that it would ultimately lead to less pain, less frequency of pain, and more enjoyment of life. Chronic pain is generally purposeless and makes people feel hopeless, because it serves no goal. If you learn to accept and to manage your pain in the ways we have described, you have a goal and a means of reaching that goal, one day and one step at a time. One of our patients summed this up nicely, \"I used to feel 126 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE controlled by my pain, but now I feel I\\'m in charge of my life, even though I still experience some pain!\" This person has overcome her fears, her felt lack of control, and her hopelessness. You can, too! Summary Dependence on pain occurs when pain is the driver and you are in the back seat. When you get in the front seat and put pain in its proper place (i.e., the back seat and eventually the trunk), you will begin to feel like life is worth living again. The laws of learning combined with the other lessons in this book can be your driver\\'s manual, helping you to reclaim your rightful place and enjoy a fulfilling life again. As a recap of this rather complicated lesson, we summarize the main points below. + Reward desirable behavior. This is the most important learning principle. Behavior that is rewarded positively will occur more frequently. Attention is one of the most important and strongest reinforcers of behavior. ^ Don\\'t reward undesirable behavior. (You know which behaviors are undesirable for you.) + Reward desirable behavior promptly and frequently. If possible, ask someone else to reward your efforts on an unpredictable schedule. ^ Keep your eye on your long-term goals, but chart progress as effort rather than immediate results. Important changes do not always result in immediate success. Investment in the future is necessary. Activities That Can Help Critical Activities 1. List at least three things that you can do for yourself that you would find rewarding. Use these after you have put in effort in your pain management program. 2. Over a couple of days, notice only your positive behaviors, pay attention to them, and dwell on them. Ignore as much as possible negative behaviors. How does this feel? 3. Over a day or two, keep track of the number of complimentary and the number of critical statements you make to people who are important to you. Do the results surprise you and perhaps indicate a need for change on your part? Changing Behavior 127 4. Every day for the next week try to give at least one person a sincere compliment. Notice how they react. Notice how you feel afterwards. Optional Activities 5. What behaviors would you like to pay more attention to and what behaviors would you like to deemphasize now that you are familiar with the principles of learning? 6. Pay attention to how people respond to you when you tell them you are having a good day or are feeling somewhat less pain. a. Do they ignore you? b. Do they immediately give you more responsibilities or unrewarding tasks to do? c. Do they seem less willing to spend time with you, because you appear \"better\"? Are they glad that they can go their own way again? How does this contrast with how they respond when you tell them you are having a bad day or things are not going well? a. Do they give you more attention? b. Do they spend more time with you? c. Do they get frustrated or angry? If they give you less attention when you are well and feeling good, does this sometimes lead you to try to convince them of the severity of your pain? Can you see a vicious circle here? 7. Keep a reward journal for your efforts for the next 2 weeks. Record your positive behavior (e.g., effort, action), how you rewarded yourself, and how you felt after the reward. Day Effort, action Reward Feeling after L E S S O N 7 Changing Thoughts and Feelings If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing, but your estimate of it. This you have the power to revoke at any time. Marcus Aurelius * / hinking is the way we talk to ourselves (i.e., self-talk). Feeling is the way our emotions JL. react to our thoughts or behavior. Thinking and feeling are very different than doing, of course. When our patients are having difficulty with our program thus far, we focus more closely on their thinking and feeling. Perhaps you may be thinking at this point, \"I am practicing the principles of pacing, balance, and learning. I know what I must do to succeed. How come I don\\'t feel better yet? In fact, today I feel lousy.\" Although natural at this point, this is the kind of self-talk that can be discouraging and can lead to setbacks in your progress. This is because thoughts and feelings play a central role in continuing to change and experiencing satisfaction with change. In this lesson you will learn methods that will enable you to influence your thoughts and feelings and, thereby, your pain. These include methods that will help you think more realistically and prevent your feelings from dictating your behavior. If you are having trouble so far and you have been doing all of the critical activities in the previous lessons, these methods may be the key to your breakthrough. Method 1: Thinking Differently Try to recall a serious conflict that you have had with someone. What feelings or emotions can you recall before, during, or after this conflict? Did you feel anger, frustration, sadness, or worry? We would like you to consider that you thought yourself into these feelings. And we would also like you to consider that these feelings then influenced the way you later thought and then how you feltyet another vicious circle. 130 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE One major way our habitual manner of thinking gets in our way is that our \"interpretation\" of problems changes the way we view reality. This distortion leads to feelings that are distressing. And these distressing emotions produce major negative changes in our bodies and hence in our experience of pain. Our feelings also influence how we think. If we feel upset, we may think, \"I really didn\\'t handle that very well. I\\'m not good at dealing with conflicts.\" Or, \"He is being really mean. I should never have married him.\" A second way that distressing feelings from conflicts are intensified is that we think or feel about the conflict or our feelings too much and from only one (typically our own) perspective. This may lead to actions we regret and the negative emotions that follow those actions. We may lash out. Or we may get stuck in feeling sorry for ourselves. Think of a time when you had a conflict with someone, something that got your mind and emotions all riled up. Then, unexpectedly, something else important and engrossing came up and you were distracted for a day or two. During that period, you probably did not have time to think about the conflict that was so much on your mind before. Likely, the very first time you again revisited the conflict you felt much less distressed. However, if then you continued to dwell on it, you likely aroused the feelings that were put aside. You actually thought yourself into the same spot you were in before you were distracted. Thinking and feeling are powerful. They can be used to distress us, but they also can be used to help us. For example, just as it is possible to evoke negative thinking and distressing emotions, it is also possible to influence thinking and feeling positively. In this regard, one of the real differences between a pessimist and an optimist is that the optimist focuses thoughts and feelings on pleasant things, whereas the pessimist focuses on the things that can and do go wrong. For someone thinking pessimistically, even the most positive situation can be viewed negatively. For example, imagine a pleasant scene in which a couple is having a picnic on a lovely spring afternoon. They are sitting under a tree next to a small brook. Now, in this instance, the wife sees only the positive characteristics of this scene, whereas the husband sees something quite different. She thinks about the beautiful blue sky, the shade the tree is providing, and the delicious meal to come. He, on the other hand, is thinking about the possibility that the grass might stain their clothes, that the food might get infested with ants, that the clouds in the distance portend a storm. As he thinks about these things more and more, he begins to believe that the storm he has conjured up may involve thunder, and they are sitting under a tree. He begins looking at his watch to see if they have enough time to eat before the storm arrives. Who do you think is enjoying their time more? \"Now,\" perhaps you are thinking, \"that\\'s all well and good for a picnic, but what about my pain? That\\'s no picnic at all.\" That is true, but on a given day, how you think about your pain will influence how you think about other things that day, what emotions you experience that day, how you behave that day, and even how much pain you will experience that day. Changing Thoughts and Feelings 131 For example, perhaps you wake up in pain and begin thinking about how hopeless your situation is, how helpless you feel to influence the pain, and how your friends are off doing things that you cannot do. This leads to your noticing how much the walls need painting, how you can no longer paint the way you used to, and how you can\\'t even have company in because the walls are dingy. As a result of these thoughts, you are likely going to feel sad, depressed, envious, angry, or some combination of these emotions. This, in turn, will increase tension in your body and your sense of exhaustion, and both of these will add to your pain and to your experience of the intensity of your pain. (Remember, your feelings can open the pain gate and make your pain even more intense.) Negative and distressing thoughts also have the effect of increasing distressing feelings because they lead to focusing on the \"worst possibility\" in the future (e.g., your whole house is falling down). This soon grows to a probability, and you are likely to end up feeling like a helpless and hopeless captive of your pain forevermore. These thoughts and feelings cause your body to go into \"fight or flight\" mode (anger, tension) or into complete passivity (depression). Either way, you lose, and your pain increases. Pain seems to be a cruel judge, and you will soon feel as if you have a life sentence without possibility of parole. \"Wait,\" you may think, \"I\\'m a realist, not a pessimist.\" But there is a difference between \"negative\" thinking and \"realistic thinking.\" In Exhibit 7.1, we list some of the negative thoughts our patients have admitted to having. Do any of them sound familiar? Exhibit 7.1. Negative Thinking \"My pain is terrible!\" \"I can\\'t bear it! How long must this go on?\" \"I shouldn\\'t have so much pain. I don\\'t deserve this.\" \"I simply have to find some relief now!\" \"Why can\\'t they make my pain go away?\" \"I\\'m going crazy! Where will this all end?\" \"I\\'m going to be an invalid. I can hardly do anything any more.\" \"I\\'m a burden to those around me.\" \"I\\'ll never get better.\" \"This is going to get worse and worse. Maybe I\\'ll go crazy.\" \"No one else can ever really understand this pain.\" \"I\\'ll never be able to enjoy life again.\" \"It\\'s all my fault that I\\'m in this mess.\" \"It\\'s all (my boss\\'s, etc., fill in the blanks) fault that I\\'m in this mess.\" 132 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Exhibit 7.2. Realistic Thinking \"The extreme pain is back again, but I know that it is only temporary.\" \"By relaxing my muscles I can make my pain more bearable.\" \"I can take a bit more rest today between activities. Tomorrow I\\'ll get back on my regular activity routine again.\" \"I want to do something pleasant or telephone somebody, as a distraction.\" \"I can keep my breathing as deep and even as possible and this will reduce my experience of pain.\" \"Bad days are to be expected, we all have them. I might as well enjoy what there is to enjoy, even on the bad days.\" \"I can stay in control of the rest of my life, even when my neck hurts.\" \"Things are going slowly but in the right direction. I\\'m going to get better and better.\" After working the program outlined in this book, these same people learned to think more realistically. Exhibit 7.2 lists their thoughts later on. Note that the statements listed in Exhibit 7.2 do not indicate that the person\\'s pain is totally gone. Some of them indicate our patient is having a bad pain day. But their realistic thoughts have a much more positive influence on their experience of pain than their negative or pessimistic thoughts, which open the pain gate. As another example, let\\'s imagine that two different people wake up with a splitting headache. One thinks, \"This is a result of that busy day yesterday. I overdid it when I was exercising. I\\'ll take a hot shower and take it easier today.\" The other thinks, \"This is the same pain my father described just before he had that stroke. I\\'m probably going to have a stroke. I must go to see the doctor immediately. But it is Saturday. What am I going to do?\" The first person now feels more relaxed, less distressed, and more in control. The second person feels anxious, discouraged, and helpless (i.e., dependent on others to feel better). As a result, for the second person, the headache may worsen. By the time the second person gets to the doctor, he will alarm the doctor to the point that she orders a CAT scan. Waiting for the test results, he feels even more anxious and his pain is almost unbearable. Fortunately, the CAT scan shows nothing abnormal. Unfortunately, the relief he now feels reinforces the unhelpful chain of thoughts, emotions and behaviors (i.e., relief is a reward for negative behavior). Both people had a headache, but their reactions resulted in very different consequences. Changing Thoughts and Feelings 133 Here are some more common thinking errors our patients have shared with us: 1. Blaming: They make someone or something else responsible for their pain. \"My lousy boss caused my job accident.\" \"My family demands so much from me. That\\'s why I can\\'t afford the time or money to take care of this pain.\" Or, the blame is turned inward: \"It\\'s all my fault that this happened to me.\" \"If only I hadn\\'t . . .\" 2. \"Should\" Statements: The words should, must, or ought appear regularly in negative thinking and irrational thoughts about pain. \"Shoulds\" are secret put-downs, implying that a person is stupid, foolish or weak. \"I should have thought of good body mechanics before I lifted that box.\" \"I shouldn\\'t have been in such a hurry. That\\'s why I slipped on the ice.\" \"I must keep up with all my responsibilities, pain or no pain.\" \"I shouldn\\'t react to pain like this.\" 3. Polarized Thinking: Everything is \"black or white,\" \"good or bad\" when we think in a polarized way. There is no gray area in which reality or improvement can be seen. Polarized thinking is often couched in terms of absolute statements with certain cue words such as all, every, none, never, always, everybody, and nobody. \"I stopped doing my activities for 2 days and now I\\'m really in pain. I\\'ll never be able to manage my pain.\" \"I feel worse today than I did yesterday. My pain is never going to go away.\" \"I always start a program but then I always quit. Every time is going to be the same, so what\\'s the use?\" \"Everybody else can do this program. I\\'m always the one who can\\'t do things.\" \"Nobody can help me.\" 4. Catastrophizing: When we catastrophize, we react to situations by imagining the worst possible outcome or scenario. \"I know that the only option left is to have surgery. I\\'m sure I\\'ll be laid up for months. Then I\\'ll probably be worse than before.\" \"What if statements are often catastrophizing in disguise: \"What if the operation is a failure?\" \"What if my pain never gets better, and I have to live like an invalid for the rest of my life?\" \"What if my spouse leaves me?\" \"What if I am unable to work?\" 5. Control Fallacies: This involves feeling or thinking that one is \"externally controlled\" by others, such as those in the medical profession, or that one is more in control of the outcomes of problems than one really is. \"This new doctor is really going to help me. I know she\\'s the one.\" \"If I don\\'t do it, no one will.\" \"Everyone depends on me. I\\'ve got to recover quickly or the family will fall apart.\" 6. Emotional Reasoning: This line of thinking assumes that what you feel emotionally must be true in reality. \"I\\'m taking too long too heal. I must be doing something wrong.\" \"The 134 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE pain is back again full force. It\\'s never going to stop.\" \"I\\'m useless. I\\'ll never be able to (fill in the blank) again.\" 7. Filtering: Filtering involves seeing situations through a kind of tunnel vision. Most often, people filter out any potentially positive aspects of their lives. \"This is not living. What\\'s the use?\" (ignoring the sunny day, the phone call from his son, and the delicious breakfast a neighbor fixed). 8. Entitlement Fallacy: Some level of pain and discomfort is a normal part of life, as are illness, loss, aging, and eventually death. Some people feel that they are \"entitled\" to escape these human experiences (witness the rise in cosmetic surgery). \"This kind of pain isn\\'t fair.\" \"Why do I have to go through this?\" \"My husband is older than I am and he experiences relatively no pain. Why am I always the one?\" 9. Overgeneralizing: This type of thinking is similar to catastrophizing. Most often, it consists of assuming that the occurrence of a single event or situation is characteristic of most if not all others. \"I tried twice to use controlled breathing, and I don\\'t feel any better. It\\'s never going to work.\" \"If today is bad, tomorrow is going to be worse.\" 10. Mind reading: This involves making assumptions about the thoughts behind another person\\'s words or actions. \"My family avoids talking to me about my pain. They don\\'t really care about me.\" \"If she really cared, she\\'d be here rather than out with her friends for lunch.\" Contrary to what most people think, it is often more difficult to accept that others care for us than to think they don\\'t care at all. These kinds of thinking errors are related to each other, as you may have inferred. In fact, if you have a tendency toward one line of thinking, you will probably catch yourself doing one or two of the others. Do any of these ways of thinking seem to characterize your style? Most people (even people with no pain) tend to use some form of faulty thinking, especially when under stress. We are going to ask you to label your thoughts in the activities at the end of this lesson. As you try to label your own thoughts, don\\'t be surprised if it is confusing at first. It takes practice to identify your thinking errors. Also, although the 10 categories described are a helpful way of showing the most common kinds of thinking errors, the boundaries between categories often blur. This is another reason that the activities suggested may be difficult at first. We focus a lot on thinking in this book because the ramifications are serious. For example, faulty thinking often leads to poor sleep. How? When you focus on how bad things are, you are likely to feel more miserable. Uncertainty, worries, and fear keep you from getting to Changing Thoughts and Feelings 135 sleep and staying asleep. Lack of sleeps tires you out so that you can do less the next day. This inactivity further undermines your self-confidence, causes you to lose your hope, and makes you feel helpless and depressed. Meanwhile, your pain is feeling worse. If you have consistent difficulty falling asleep and you are following a balanced activity and rest program, monitor your thoughts more carefully, particularly before you go to sleep or wake up in the morning. Most people engage in faulty thinking more often either in the morning or at night. Which time makes you most vulnerable to this kind of thinking? To summarize our discussion so far, your negative or faulty thoughts about your situation can lead to emotions and more thinking that may not match reality. What you think quickly initiates what you feel. What you feel can then often lead to more faulty thinking and to what you do (or don\\'t do) to help yourself. When you catch yourself in negative or faulty thinking, try to just gently label these thoughts as such and move on to a more realistic thought. Method 2: Behaving Differently There is an adage, \"If you can\\'t feel a certain way, try acting that way for awhile.\" That is because it is easier to act yourself into feeling differently than feeling yourself into acting differently. This does not mean being a fake, as you will see further along in this section. Consider the following: Have you ever noticed in the past that when you feel that you look good in the mirror, you tend to carry yourself differently, and people respond accordingly? On bad pain days, one of our patients wears only his favorite ties to work. These ties make him feel as if he looks good, even when he doesn\\'t feel so good. When he\\'s in the washroom, seeing the tie in the mirror reminds him to smile. Often, he will be complemented on his tie. But is it the tie or the smile? Another patient of ours always serves herself lunch on her best china on days she feels the worst. It reminds her of the good things in life. Another patient forces herself to reach out at least once to someone else who is having trouble during her \"bad weeks.\" Oddly enough, feelings often follow behavior, so you have more control over how you feel than you may realize. Your feelings don\\'t have to determine your mood or your behavior. If you are feeling bad, you can still decide how you will respond to your mood and pain. You can still decide whether you will think and behave in a positive way or whether you will surrender to your feelings and think and behave in a more negative fashion. We\\'re not saying it\\'s easy. However, it is good to always be aware that although you can\\'t control situations (e.g., pain, other people), you do have some choices about how to respond inwardly and outwardly. And having choices is always a good thing! 136 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE For example, when you feel sad, you can choose to pull the covers over your head. Or you can choose to unburden your heart, or listen to music you love and allow your tears to flow, or write about it in your journal. If you still feel sad, you can choose to feel bitter or you can choose to act yourself into feeling different. Afterward, you may find yourself thinking, \"My sadness has had enough space to express itself; now I\\'m going to enjoy myself.\" \"My sadness is still here, but I will take a shower, do a few stretching exercises, and dress in my favorite clothes. \"I\\'ve listened to some sad music and gotten the tears out. Now I think I\\'ll put some more lively music on.\" It may well be that as you do these things you notice that you are singing or whistling along with the music and feeling better. Even after funerals, usually at the wake or visitation, people turn from their grief for a while to recall positive features of and experiences with the deceased. Some groups have gatherings when someone dies to celebrate their lives and to recall fond memories as well as to share their grief and loss. Often people are surprised to find themselves laughing at such times. But they shouldn\\'t feel guilty about it. Life goes on. We can choose to live in the moment or dwell in the past or future. With regard to success in this method, when you feel tired and listless and you go swimming, you have had a successful day, whether or not your mood has changed. When you are in pain and call a friend to listen to her concerns, you have had a successful day, even if your mood has not changed. Success is not measured by moods or by pain but by the courage to take steps despite the pain. Always remember that you have choices. Let\\'s look once more at this idea of \"acting yourself into feeling\" for a person without chronic pain. A person who lacks self-confidence can be taught to look, walk, and speak like someone with confidence. As a result, she feels more confident. A shy person who speaks softly and indistinctly and avoids the other\\'s gaze is saying, without words, \"I am not important. Don\\'t pay any attention to me.\" She can be taught to speak up, look into the eyes of the person she is speaking with, and smile. As a result, she feels more outgoing. Life requires us to play many roles. Sometimes people know only one role, so their range is limited. One person only knows how to clown through unpleasant and distressing emotions. Another person knows only how to be a supporting character, never the star of the play; some people are always trying to be the star. Some people only know how to play serious roles. They can never audition for a romantic comedy. In the theatre of life, it is good to have a flexible set of roles to play, so that you are not just looking on. In other words, don\\'t wait until you have a particular emotion to act the part. Experiment with different behaviors until the part seems to come naturally. Try to remember that thinking differently and behavioral change lead to emotional change. Exhibit 7.3 illustrates this. Changing Thoughts and Feelings 137 Exhibit 7.3.

Albert Ellis, a famous psychologist who focused on helping people change their thoughts, had a humorous saying, \"Don\\'t musturbate.\" When you tell yourself that certain things must, should, or have to be done, you cause emotional pressure and bodily tension and distress. If this tension exceeds a certain level or if it lasts too long, it has a \"paralyzing\" effect. As a result, you may start to feel overwhelmed. Moreover, these \"musts\" and \"shoulds\" cause more pain. Unrealistic expectations of oneself can be a real burden. This is especially true for younger chronic pain patients with families who used to rely on them for income, housekeeping, cooking, yard work, and so on. They feel that they \"should\" still be productive, even on very bad pain days. Releasing oneself from such unrealistic expectations can bring surprising relief. For example, one of our patients felt he \"should\" continue a foreign language course that he was taking for enrichment. The class formerly met in one place, but that semester it was being held at another. He drove around frantically because he could not find the new location. Finally, he saw a cozy little diner and decided (reluctantly) to ask for directions. Once there, the nice waitress and the happy conversations among the patrons convinced him to have a cup of coffee. He began to relax and realize that he was hungry. The aroma of the 138 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE home-cooked meat loaf convinced him to order dinner. So what if he was late, he thought. Then, halfway through dinner, he decided to skip the class altogether. He felt slightly guilty but then thought, \"The heck with that,\" and began laughing out loud to himself. It was a hobby, not a job! The whole evening was spent relaxing and enjoying the moment. The next semester, he decided to take a foreign cooking course, which he enjoyed thoroughly. Activities that you feel forced to perform or feel that you have to do are perceived as more difficult than activities that you feel you have chosen voluntarily. This applies generally but is especially apt for activities in which fear plays a role. Let\\'s consider another parent-child example to illustrate this point. If your child does not want to eat properly, and you repeatedly and continually insist on his eating nutritious food, he will feel a certain amount of pressure. As a result, he may become steadily more resistant and more obstinate with regard to eating healthfully. In effect, you are rewarding negative behavior with attention. You increase your chances of being successful in your nutritional goals by phrasing your wish as a choice and rewarding positive behavior. For example, you might say, \"You are allowed to choose to eat from what\\'s on your plate, and if you eat something healthy you will receive a nice dessert.\" In this way, you can encourage your child to eat nutritious food. Make it clear that the child does not have to eat the nutritious food on his plate but is allowed to eat it. If in addition to the french fries he also eats the spinach and chicken, then he will receive dessert that he likes. The positive attention follows the positive behavior. This may take time, but it is time that is not wasted on rewarding unhealthy behavior (such as nagging when your child refuses to eat). There are a number of well-entrenched prejudices and misconceptions that lead to people putting too much pressure on themselves. These \"musts\" and \"shoulds\" undermine selfrespect and make life unnecessarily difficult. Consider the following misconceptions: ^ I must be appreciated and loved. ^ I should do more. Love depends on what I do, not who I am. + I must be physically fit, youthful looking, and attractive to be accepted. + I must achieve something important every day. ^ I should not pay attention to myself, as this is egotistical. + I should give in completely to others\\' requests. + I should be self-critical in order to improve. + I should not praise myself because that is conceited. + I must learn to live with my pain without complaining. + I must act as if I feel fine at all times. Are there any of these misconceptions that you believe? Try picking out one and challenging it on a daily basis. Changing Thoughts and Feelings 139 One of our patients, Julie, who was too dependent on the opinion of others, found a button that read, \"What you think of me is none of my business.\" She kept this by her telephone. It helped her begin to \"act real\" when she was conversing with someone and not worry as much about their opinions of her. Consider another of our patients, Lorraine. Lorraine had been working with us for 6 months and had returned to work. Here is her story. Lorraine has recently started working for an attorney after being out of work for several years because of a back injury. Her boss frequently waits until the last minute to give her an assignment. Then, he expects her to work miracles. It is Friday and, once again, Lorraine has been given an assignment before lunch and an unrealistic deadline to meet. The work must be completed by that evening. Lorraine has plans after work, which makes things even worse. She begins typing away immediately. She skips lunch and does not take breaks so that she will get it all done in time. She feels her back strain from the buildup of pressure and from sitting in a rigid position. She clenches her teeth, trying to ignore her pain and her feelings. She finds herself thinking, + \"My boss should have planned ahead better.\" ^ \"If I ignore the pain, I can get this done.\" + \"I can\\'t afford to go slowly or take a break because my boss might think I can\\'t do the job.\" By the end of the day, Lorraine has not only an aching back but also a pounding tension headache and pain in her jaw from gritting her teeth all day. She cancels her plans and arrives home exhausted. She immediately collapses into bed but has trouble sleeping. On Saturday, Lorraine remembers some of what we have discussed together about coping with stress, and she begins to think about her day in a different light. She comes up with the following thoughts to replace the ones she had the day before: ^ \"Yes, it would have been nice if my boss had planned ahead better, but that didn\\'t happen. My getting upset about that doesn\\'t help me get through my work. I can manage this.\" + \"Next time I\\'ll stretch and relax in short intervals throughout the day, and the pain won\\'t be so bad later.\" + \"Eventually, I\\'ll need to let my boss know that I have a back injury. He won\\'t think less of me. I\\'m good at what I do and I always get the work done.\" + \"When we get to know each other better, I\\'ll sit down and discuss how we might get the work done at a less hectic pace.\" 140 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE ^ \"Since I missed my outing last night, I\\'ll plan a really nice weekend for myself. I\\'ll call a friend after I have a leisurely breakfast.\" What was your reaction when you read the first (Friday) and then the alternative (Saturday) set of self-statements? Did you feel a sense of pressure with the first statements and a sense of relief with the second? Also, did you recognize any of the self-care suggestions we have made in the previous lessons? Method 4: Stopping at the Right Time If you push yourself too hard and feel you have to go on with an activity or commitment, you may do harm to the progress that you have achieved. It is important to finish an activity while it is still enjoyable and to stop when it is still fun or at least not painful! This last suggestion implies that it is important that you have some control over pressure when other people are involved. This was an important thing that Lorraine learned with her work assignments. It applies as well to social situations. When you go somewhere with someone, for example, let them know that there is a chance that you may want to leave earlier than they will. Ask in advance for the other\\'s cooperation in this regard or suggest that you take separate cars. When you arrive at your destination (e.g., theatre, concert, or movie), try to arrange a seat that will enable you to leave easily if you find it necessary to do so. For example, at a theatre, reserve a seat at the end of the row near the exit. You will notice that the feeling that you are in control (i.e., able to leave) is very liberating in itself and thus reduces tension. When you are doing something \"fun\" that you are not really enjoying, give yourself permission to stop (remember our patient who was taking the foreign language course). For example, staying at a party where you are not having fun because of your pain is not a useful strategy. For one thing, you may come to associate going to parties with having unbearable pain. Over time, you may find yourself avoiding social gatherings more and more. If, on the other hand, you leave when you are still feeling good, you give your body and mind the message that parties and socializing are fun. Letting go of unreasonable demands and acting in your own self-interest allows you to feel more in control of your life and more independent of your pain. You are able to determine what is reasonable to do or not do, maintain a reasonable daily and weekly schedule, and take pleasure in all kinds of activities. You\\'ll do these things not because you should but because you want to. The risk of forcing yourself beyond your limits is greater in situations where you cannot be yourself or where you are not free to do as you wish. If you have a visitor, you might be Changing Thoughts and Feelings 141 afraid of appearing inhospitable if you ask the guest to leave. When you are back at work, you want to make a positive impression, and you cannot just walk away. This means that despite the pain, you do your utmost as well and as long as possible, until it really becomes unbearable. A result of this can be that visiting others or receiving a visit becomes an emotional burden. Working is associated with excessive pain, so you fear and avoid work. (Ah, now you are starting to understand the power and pervasiveness of the laws of learning!) You need a safe climate. You can only reduce your disability if you have new, different, successful experiences with visits, work, and other stressful or emotionally charged situations. Only success in these situations will remove the pressure and tension and help you build self-confidence. Not working or not having others over for visits (in short, giving in to your pain) does not really eliminate the pain or even reduce it. On the contrary, by giving in to the pain in this way you reduce self-confidence and will likely experience even more pain (see the next lesson for more about pain and self-confidence). The ABCD Model The ABCD model can be a useful tool in helping you deal with pain and other stressors in your life. The model was developed by therapist Albert Ellis to help people with problems other than physical pain. However, we have found it to be extremely helpful in work with our patients with chronic pain. This is how it works: A is the \"activating event,\" or stressor. It can be physical, emotional, social, or environmental. For our purposes, let\\'s make A a muscle spasm in your back that keeps you from fulfilling a commitment. B is your \" belief system.\" This consists of your thoughts and attitudes about the stressor. For example, you may think, \"Now I can\\'t do what I said I would. My friends will think I\\'m weak and always unreliable. I can\\'t do anything right anymore.\" C stands for the \"consequences\" of the activating event and your belief system. Consequences are often feelings or emotions. For example, as a result of the kind of thinking described above, you feel down or depressed. You might also feel pain as you tense your back muscles. D is the way out. D means \"disputing (challenging, questioning) your negative belief system (the negative thinking that goes on after the stressor). This disputing, in turn, affects how you feel. For example, you might question whether your friends will really think that you are weak. You would certainly also challenge the statement \"I can\\'t do anything anymore.\" 142 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE How to Use the ABCD Model in Your Own Life The ABCD model takes practice but yields extremely positive results over time. As you read this section, we suggest that you start using it whenever you catch a thought that is unhelpful. Use the model on paper in your journal or notebook (see Activity 3 at the end of this lesson for a structured approach). Try to increase the number of times you catch such thoughts. Some find that using the structured format on paper in the beginning is the key to success. So you may want to give that a try. Whether you use a chart or simply jot down the As, Bs, Cs, and Ds, you will become acquainted with your belief system. Over time you will more automatically and rapidly dispute the negative thinking that affects how you feel and gets in your way of living life. As you become more familiar with using the model, you will be able to use it without writing, simply working out the ABCDs in your mind. Let\\'s start with an exercise using the structured format. Try not to skip any steps (e.g., don\\'t jump from B to D). A. First, write down a recent stressor or event that was followed by a pain flare-up. Keep this concise. A few lines are enough. For example, \"I twisted in my chair while reaching for the phone and felt my back strain.\" If you\\'re having trouble thinking of a stressor, just go over the past 2 or 3 days when you felt pain. The more recent the stressor, the better able you will be to identify all thoughts and feelings. B. Next, list all thoughts you may have had when your pain-related stressor occurred. For example, \"My back is going out again.\" \"I have to take up the slack and answer the phone for the other secretary who\\'s always out sick.\" \"I thought my doctor said this wouldn\\'t happen if I exercised regularly.\" C. Third, jot down all feelings you had right after the stressor. A key to identifying feelings (rather than thoughts) is that when describing feelings you don\\'t usually use the word that. If you find yourself saying \"I felt that I ...\" you are likely describing a thought, not a feeling. For example, \"I thought that the other secretary was faking,\" is not really a feeling. However, it may contain hints to your feelings. For example, it may contain clues to the feeling \"I felt victimized.\" Notice that you don\\'t say, \"I felt that I was victimized.\" \"That\" typically doesn\\'t occur in feeling statements. Changing Thoughts and Feelings 143 Other examples of how you might have felt in this situation are, \"I felt angry and disappointed. Later I felt a bit hopeless.\" You do not need a long list of feelings. A few key ones will do. These feelings are the consequences of your thinking. D. Finally, you will dispute the thoughts you listed in the second step. You question whether \"my back is going out again\" is really the case. You might think instead, \"My back hurts sometimes. Over time it will get better.\" Instead of, \"My doctor said this wouldn\\'t happen,\" you might think, \"My doctor said that these events will happen less frequently if I keep to my pain management program.\" And finally, you might question whether the other secretary is always out sick.\" You might think instead, \"She\\'s out sick a lot. I wonder if she\\'s struggling with some physical or emotional problem.\" As a result of disputing your belief, your feelings may change or become less intense. You may feel, for example, just mildly irritated at the other secretary. You may also feel less hopeless or sad. As a result of having fewer negative feelings, you will likely be able to think of more positive things you can do for yourself. You might think, for example, \"I\\'ll do some relaxation exercises in the ladies\\' room for a little while.\" \"At lunch, I\\'ll go for a short walk and have a chat with one of my coworkers.\" \"I\\'m going to trust that I will feel better over time.\" \"I\\'ll seek some diversion and I trust that I\\'ll be alright again in a couple of days.\" Work with this ABCD process right now until you feel comfortable with it. Pay particular attention to the fact that the activating event does not lead to your feelings. It is your thoughts and beliefs that lead to these feelings. These thoughts represent your interpretation of an event. If you are having trouble disputing your beliefs, you might list several possible interpretations of an event and ask yourself, \"Which interpretation of the event is most useful to me right now?\" As you go through your day, note when you feel stressed or when you are feeling negative. You can ask yourself the following questions: \"What events led up to my negative feelings?\" \"What did I believe or think about the event that may have led me to become upset?\" \"Are these beliefs or thoughts really true and accurate?\" \"Are there other more constructive ways to think about what happened?\" One of our patients, Rose, described a recent event that became a stressor. Let\\'s see how she worked with the ABCD model informally. Note that she had been working with the model for a while, so she didn\\'t need to label the ABCDs, but you can see each as the case is discussed. This case also illustrates some of the stress-reduction and relational issues described in the previous lesson. See you if you can identify them as you read the material. Rose\\'s husband was on a business trip for four days. She had decided to go on an outing with a good friend the day before he was due home. Rose had a really good time, 144 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE but that night she needed to take out the trash. She carried a garbage sack that was too heavy to the curb and spent a restless night in pain. When her husband arrived the next morning, instead of greeting him warmly, she began telling him all the negative things that had occurred while he was away. She didn\\'t even think to tell him about the nice time she had had with her friend. Her husband suddenly remembered that he had promised to fix a widow\\'s broken porch light and told her he would be right back. He was gone for over a half hour, and by this time she was fuming. She decided to take a hot bath to calm down. She put some lavender soap bubbles in the tub. As she relaxed, she isolated the event that led to her pain. Rose realized that she was blaming her husband for everything that went wrong while he was away. She then felt victimized and fearful (\"What would happen if he were to go away even longer?\"). That kind of thinking, she thought, had led to her complaining so much when he came home. Then, when her husband left to help the neighbor, Rose had interpreted his behavior as uncaring. She had thought, \"He cares more about a neighbor than he does about me.\" She then had felt angry and abandoned. Rose felt stuck for a while at this point, but she knew from past experience that eventually she would work things out. So, she enjoyed the smell of the lavender and the feel of the warm water surrounding her. After a few minutes of relaxing, she began to remember the good time she had had with her friend the day before. She thought about how much her friend really liked her and how good that made her feel. Rose remembered how she had complimented her friend on her new hairstyle. Then Rose thought of her behavior when her husband had returned home. She had done the opposite of complimenting him. This insight led her to think about his leaving for the neighbor\\'s in light of her own behavior. She found herself laughing and saying to herself, \"I guess we both like being around women who appreciate us.\" When her husband came home, Rose\\'s pain was still there (although it had decreased after the bath). More important, however, her mood had changed and so did her behavior. She asked her husband about his trip. He came over to the sofa and began talking a little hesitantly. She smiled as he was talking, and he relaxed and took her hand. They both laughed at some of the posturing of his colleagues. By the time they had finished talking, Rose noticed that her pain didn\\'t seem as bad. This lesson contains a wealth of material that can help you not only deal better with your pain but also improve other areas of your life. It is critical, however, that you not just read this material but put it into practice immediately. In the activities we suggest, we focus more on learning to monitor and identify thoughts and on using the ABCD model than on the other methods that we describe in this lesson. All of the methods are useful. Once you have the ABCD model mastered, you may want to review the other sections in this lesson. They can only add to your progress over time. Changing Thoughts and Feelings 145 Activities That Can Help Critical Activities 1. Over the next three days try to jot down in your journal or notebook all of the thoughts that occur to you concerning your pain. Note when and where these thoughts occur. Try to act as an objective observer while writing down your thoughts. In other words, try not to censor or debate your thoughts; simply write down all the thoughts that come to you. Remember that it takes practice to become familiar with your particular brand of thinking. Automatic thinking is lightning fast. The first day you will likely miss some thoughts. But the second and third day you should have quite a list. Go over your thoughts and try to label them using the list on pages 133-134. Don\\'t be concerned if some don\\'t fall into a specific category. Just leave an underline to go back to some time later. Then, over the following 3 days, try to catch your thoughts in stressful situations even if these are not directly related to your pain. Do the same labeling process at the end of the 3 days. This practice will be invaluable as you get to know your patterns of thinking. 2. Take the thoughts that you recorded in the previous activity and choose one category of thoughts that recur (e.g., catastrophizing). You may want to choose the category in which thoughts occur most frequently. Any time one of these kinds of thoughts comes up in the next week, use your journal or notebook to write down statements to dispute these thoughts. After you become adept at disputing one category of thoughts, work on a second category of thoughts. We have listed a set of thoughts below that our patients have found useful in disputing their automatic thoughts. See if you can use some of them. See if you can add some of your own that will be useful in the future. + \"I can cope.\" ^ \"It\\'s no one\\'s fault that I am in pain.\" + \"Relax, I can manage my pain.\" ^ \"I have managed this situation before and I can manage it again.\" + \"Most people act out of their own motivations. It\\'s unlikely they really meant to hurt my feelings.\" ^ \"I am learning new coping skills each day.\" ^ \"The pain comes and goes. I can outlast it.\" + \"No one thinks less of me because I have this pain.\" 146 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE My own disputing thoughts: Optional Activities 3. If you like a more structured approach, you may want to construct a table in your notebook or journal and keep a diary of stressful situations using the ABCD model. Date and time 9/14, 8:35 a.m. 9/15, 10:30 a.m. A Back pain while driving Boss yelled at me B \"Oh no my back is going out again.\" \"I\\'ll have to pull over and never get to where I\\'m going.\" \"I\\'ll be laid up now for weeks.\" \"How could I be so stupid?\" \"He probably wants to fire me.\" \"There goes my next promotion and raise.\" \" He is always expecting the impossible.\" \"I can\\'t stand much more of this!\" C Fear; anxiety; sick to my stomach Shame; anger; crying; heart racing D \"It will be okay. I may have to take a break and be late. I\\'ll take it easy a bit later.\" \"I feel bad that he yelled at me. He\\'s probably having a really bad day. I\\'ll talk to him some other day when we\\'re both less stressed to see how we can make things go more smoothly in the office. Tonight, I\\'ll take a bubble bath and call a friend to plan an outing.\" Note. A = activating event (pain or other distressing situation); B = belief systems (thoughts); C = consequences (feelings, behaviors, physical sensations); D = disputation.

Questions to consider. ^ When you can once again be active (e.g., walk, exercise, do chores around the house) and when you are relaxed and friendly despite the pain, how do you explain to people when you have a setback and act and feel differently? + Do you expect and demand too much of yourself on good days or on bad days? How can you change these expectations? L E S S O N 8 Gaining Self-Confidence The transition from tenseness, self-responsibility, and worry to balance, receptivity, and peace is the most wonderful change a man can make. The chief wonder about it is that it so often comes about not by doing, but by simply relaxing and throwing the burden down. William James I f you have worked through all (or a good many) of the lessons in this book, you may _/. be feeling better, if not physically then at least emotionally. Your life is different and, although you may not yet be aware of it, the seeds of self-confidence have been planted. Every day you follow the program, it\\'s like caring for your garden. Eventually your selfconfidence will become apparent to you, like the first crocus arriving in spring. Over time, the pain will become less prominent in the foreground of your life. It will be more like background noise that is bothersome but does not stop you from living a satisfying life. You will have grown from being a person coping with pain to a person thriving despite the pain. This is all because you have + listened to your body and taken the right steps to respond to these signals; ^ developed and achieved reasonable goals; ^ paced your activity and rest cycles; ^ increased the variety of pleasurable experiences in your life; ^ improved your relationship with others; and ^ learned to think yourself into feeling better. Not only are you developing confidence in yourself, you are also developing confidence in others and in the future in general. In this lesson, you will learn how to hone some of these skills to further build your confidence. We\\'ll start with a brief recap by way of questions to consider and then build from there. 150 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE A Daily Inventory What does your body have to tell you today, right now? Only by carefully paying attention to your body moment by moment, hour by hour, and day by day can you really learn what you need to do to manage your pain. How do you feel right now? Staying aware of your feelings also helps you to learn important connections between actions (or inactions), thoughts, and stressors. What are your limitations today? It is important to distinguish, on a daily basis, what your body prevents you from doing (what you are physically incapable of doing) and what your thoughts and feelings prevent you from doing. This helps you to make friends with your body rather than attacking it with thoughts such as, \"My back is always acting up and hindering me\" (i.e., my back is the enemy). It is important to listen to your body, even if what you hear is not positive. But remember that listening to your body and giving in to discomfort are two different things. Am I beating myself up today? In the beginning, you were always tough on yourself, beating yourself up in your thoughts when you were unable to do all you expected of yourself. If you are feeling down today, you may be beating yourself up. Ask yourself why. You may be giving more than you have to give, and thus feel depleted. Or you may be having thoughts such as, \"I\\'m such a burden to others. I have to ask for help today.\" You know yourself better now, and you can identify the kinds of thoughts that may be leading you to feel bad about yourself. If I am having a bad day today, how can I keep my head above water? At some level, even on bad days, you know that you can only work with your body, not against it. Think of your body as a child. Care for it as if you were taking care of a child. You nurture the child but you do not coddle it. You listen to your child, not only when the child is happy and healthy, but also when the child has pain and is sick, don\\'t you? Do not be afraid of listening to your pain. It doesn\\'t mean the pain will take you over. You are still in charge. Learning to Love Yourself You can only grow to love yourself when you accept and respect yourself as you are. Loving yourself is not holding yourself up to some ideal of what you would like to be at any given time. Try to remember that everyone who does his best at any given time has a right to selfacceptance and respect. You are part of this \"everyone.\" When you do your best, even though it is not \"ideal,\" you still need to give you yourself credit. You may view yourself as a patient when you are having a bad day, but what if you viewed yourself first as a person, a person worthy of your own respect and goodwill despite having limitations because of your pain? Gaining Self-Confidence 151 Self-acceptance is the important first step in learning to love yourself. The second step is to invest your time and energy in your own well-being before any other priorities. This investment does not mean that you are being selfish. It means that you are being responsible. Only when we are \"full\" do we have anything left over to give to others. Only when you respect your own needs can you then respect the needs of others. We discussed acceptance early in this book. Here it is important to elaborate on that topic, because you will have difficulty building confidence and loving yourself unless you fully understand what acceptance entails. First, acceptance is an ongoing process. It is not a state that can be achieved for good. Acceptance provides a moment-to-moment climate that permits the possibility of change for the better. It is also a longer term process that entails several stages: 1. Denial of Limitations. In this early stage, people act as though nothing has happened to them. They act as if there is no real problem. They hide their condition from themselves and from others, presenting themselves as feeling better than they really feel. They may use painkillers or alcohol to continue denying their pain problem. 2. Rebellion Against and Anger About Limitations and Pain. In this stage, a person is aware of the pain and the existence of a problem, but they fight this awareness. They may push their bodies as if they were machines. They may frantically call on all kinds of specialists and feel misjudged and misunderstood by everyone. They keep fighting even if it causes them more pain. 3. Despondency, Depression, and Passivity. In this stage, a person may view the pain problem as unsolvable. They feel helpless and hopeless and do not see a way out. They may avoid responsibilities or suffer from sleeplessness during the night. They may increasingly turn to alcohol and other drugs. After a restless night, they may just stay in bed and feel hopeless. 4. Openness to Adapting to New Circumstances and to Learning New Things. In this stage, the person becomes more open minded. They decide that they have a problem but that there may be solutions. They may buy a book such as this. They may begin to feel more hope, more control over their lives. They begin to feel better about themselves, and a result, they interact with people differently. Instead of seeing setbacks as failures, they see them realistically, as part of the process of living with chronic pain. 5. Acceptance. As a result of going through these stages, they gradually come to accept their body, their situation, and their chronic pain. Instead of fighting, they make peace with their bodies and themselves. This acceptance is a process, so some days, hours, or moments they may be more accepting than others. It is important to realize that people move back and forth between these stages. That is why we emphasize that acceptance is a process. You will find yourself at different stages of 152 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE this process at different points in time, even when you are following the advice in this book and even when you are taking good care of yourself. What stage do you feel you are in today, at this very moment? It is also important to emphasize what acceptance is not. Acceptance does not mean that you no longer feel pain or that you no longer see the consequences of having chronic pain. You are still aware of limitations. Not every day is a good day. Acceptance is not pushing yourself beyond realistic limits. It is also not doing less than one is able. Acceptance is not just lying in bed either. Acceptance means just thatthat you accept the positive and the negative without needing to deny or exaggerate either. Becoming Your Own Best Friend Before you can truly garner appropriate support from others, it is crucial to become your own supporter, your own best friend. Perfectionism is the enemy in becoming your own best friend. You may not think of yourself as a perfectionist, but you may be surprised. Do you criticize yourself silently when you make a mistake. Do you say things to yourself silently such as \"that was dumb\" or \"I should have known better\"? Are your sentences littered with words like \"should\" or \"must\"? When others do things to help you, do you sometimes feel resentful because they don\\'t do them like you would if you could? These are all tell-tale signs of perfectionism. Perfectionism is the enemy, because it is not fair to demand more from yourself than you can achieve. We usually learn to become perfectionists early in life. Sometimes we learn to expect perfection in some areas but not in all areas. In the past you may have heard, \"Make sure that you make a good impression.\" \"What would the neighbors think?\" Or, you may have belonged to some highly productive organization, where you encountered much more skill in being self-critical than in being self-confident. One of our patients learned to push herself so hard that when she won a red ribbon in sewing, she felt bad because it wasn\\'t a blue ribbon. Another had had a teacher who stood her up in front of the classroom and said, \"Mary, always 99% never 100%.\" Unconsciously, such experiences become internalized. That is to say, they become part of your own self, and how you think about yourself and others. Without even being aware of it, you may be operating under the belief that \" What others think is more important than my own opinion. \" \"Only the best is good enough. \" You are a unique human being. + Think a moment about your uniqueness. What is unique about you and how you think, feel, and act. If this is difficult, think about some funny quirk, something positive. Or, just think about the size and shape of your eyes or your laugh or lifelines. It is unlikely anyone else has exactly the same shade and shape of eyes, or the exact Gaining Self-Confidence 153 placement of laugh or lifelines (don\\'t even think of them as wrinkles). Try to improve the way you talk with yourself given your uniqueness. Even limitations can be considered \"unique.\" When you try and don\\'t succeed, how about saying to yourself in a friendly way \"That was a fair try. Trying is more important than succeeding. I like and respect myself for trying. I\\'ll probably do better some other time.\" + Try not to compare yourself with others or with your \"former self.\" If a person is continually watched, observed, and evaluated, he or she experiences a lot of stress. If you are constantly doing this to yourself, you will cause yourself unnecessary stress. You\\'ll behave more naturally and feel more relaxed when you are not worried about how you measure up to some arbitrary and unachievable standard or when you are not measuring yourself against others. If you had siblings or cousins, do you remember how it felt to be \"compared\" in a negative light? It was unlikely that it made you feel good about your uniqueness or that it really motivated you in a healthy way (being \"driven\" is not being motivated in a healthy way). Instead of comparing yourself with others or with your own self, find your own way to be proud of yourself. Seeking and finding your own way will give you confidence. See how it feels to proudly say, \"I did it my way and it worked.\" You Can\\'t Earn Love Love is a gift freely given and freely received. If you think that you must do your very best to be loved, then your thinking is confused. You then try to earn love, you do yourself and often others a great injustice. In fact, you are setting yourself up to fail! Your lovability is not determined by what you do or by what you have. Being lovable is a given, like the color of your eyes. If someone does not love you as you are (assuming that you are respectful of him or her), then one must question whether they are capable of loving you (or anyone else) right now. Self-love is most important. Self-love is more about who you are, what positive qualities you would like to achieve, and the efforts you make to achieve them. Think for a moment: What kind a person do you want to be? What qualities go into being that person? How can you work toward achieving those qualities? Can you love yourself in the process (rather than just when achieving your goals)? Although the next question may seem a bit unpleasant, it can be useful to ponder. How do you want your family and friends to remember you if you die before them? Try not to get into the thought of proving something to them (or if you do, you may want to ponder this question: What do you want to prove and to whom?). 154 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE It\\'s very satisfying to be able to say to yourself, \"I don\\'t have to be as good or better than others. I just need to be myself. I can accept myself as I am, with my imperfections and my limitations and also with all my unique characteristics. That is how I want to be thought of and how I would like to be remembered.\" Controlling the Things You Can Control As we discussed earlier in the book, most things in life are not under our control. But it is helpful to take charge of things that you can control. The following statements are helpful in that regard. Try saying one of them to yourself each day, and see how they \"fit.\" ^ My situation is not responsible for my mood. I can redirect my thoughts and change my mood. + I am not (my appearance, height, intelligence [IQ], income, health, accomplishments). I am me and that is enough. ^ What others think of me is none of my business. What is more important is how I think and feel about myself.^ I am not responsible for other people\\'s moods or their happiness, but I can be a positive influence on both. The Problem of Pride When you have chronic pain, you need assistance at times. But often you may feel diminished and dependent when this occurs. Most people are unaware of it, but this is not a problem of dependency, it is a problem of pride. All of us are dependent on othersall of us. From the waitress at the coffee shop to the most powerful politicians, all of us rely on others. If you have difficulty accepting this, think about electricity. Aren\\'t we all dependent on electricity and on the workers who provide it? Aren\\'t we dependent on farmers and fishers and beef and poultry ranches for our food? \"Yes but,\" you may be thinking, \"that\\'s a condition that is shared by everyone. I have to ask for help some days in getting the mail.\" First, let\\'s look at what makes it unpleasant to you when tasks and responsibilities that used to be yours have to be taken over by others. Does it make you feel as if you are not indispensable or that you can easily be replaced? Do you begin to feel \"less than\" or worthless? Society plays a big role in glorifying (false) independence. If you have bought into this, you are likely to feel sad or angry or depressed when you need help. You may start taking these feelings out on others, who seem so independent to you. You might begin telling them Gaining Self-Confidence 155 that they are not doing tasks properly or the way you would do it. If your friends and family tell you not to worry, that they will take care of something, do you behave even worse? If they seem frustrated at being interrupted, do you feel ashamed or angry? These are all signs of false pride. This is nothing to be ashamed of, but it is something to work on. For many people, receiving is more difficult than giving. Does this ring a bell for you? Could you consider that when people help you, you are giving them a gift as well? Feeling helpful is a good feeling. Can you work on receiving help graciously and showing appreciation? If this is too difficult, find a way to help others first. See how you feel when you make a phone call and listen to someone who feels lonely or sad or anxious without needing to get anything in return. See how it feels when you offer a piece of information to someone who can use it, perhaps through a note in the mail. Then, the next time someone helps you, try to remember the good feeling you had helping someone else. Even if your helper is grumpy, don\\'t assume that helping you is not helping him or her. Be gracious anyway. If your friends and family tend to help too much, you can ask them to involve you as much as possible. Maybe you can\\'t help in the doing of the task, but you can help in the organization and planning. Also, stress to them that it is helpful to you if they would ask for your advice, counsel, and support sometimes. They may have as difficult a time asking for help as you do! With your family and with your friends, it\\'s important to think through what you really want and need before you ask them to do something for you. Often people think that they want something concrete when they really want some time and attention. Sometimes people think they want attention, when they really want someone to fix a meal. So, take the time to ask yourself what you really want. Then, find the courage (yes, it takes courage to ask for what you really want) to tell them. In a gentle way, tell the people in your life how they can help, how they can play an important role in your life. If you still have difficulty with asking for help, you may need to rephrase the way you are asking. Here are some ways that patients have found useful in asking for help: + Would you be so kind as ... + Would you possibly be able to help me . . . ^ May I please ask you to do something . . . + I would really like . . . + You would do me a great pleasure by ... + I would be grateful to you for ... Try to remember that when one person is unable to help, think of someone else. It is important to have a range of people whom you can call on for assistance. Interdependence 156 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE does not pertain to just one person. It means having a network of people with whom you can give and receive. You can be rightfully proud of yourself when you have learned to ask for help graciously, when you have learned to express appreciation for help, and when you have been able to accept \"no\" for an answer just as graciously. These capabilities will add to your self-confidence and improve relationships with friends and family. Learning to Stand Up for Yourself Many people find it hard to stand up for themselves. Lack of self-confidence, feeling unlovable, fear of conflicts, and a lifetime of habitually not asserting oneself are all obstacles to this important capability. People who don\\'t stand up for themselves tend to avoid conflicts. They may say \"yes\" when they mean \"no.\" They may not agree with something, but for the sake of peace, they give in. However, in the long run they are not able to hide their true feelings. Then, when hurt feelings and frustrations eventually become too much to contain, they are likely to be expressed in the form of an outburst of anger. The people around them are frightened, and they themselves may be frightened too. They may feel bewildered and embarrassed. They may think, \"This is not like me. I don\\'t like that person who just came out. I must never do that again.\" When people with chronic pain are not assertive, the people around them start to treat them differently, more as a patient than as a person. People no longer say what they think, but what they think the patient wants to hear. Everyone tries to mind-read, which never works. So, family and friends may avoid the person with chronic pain. Everyone eventually begins to wear a mask that is not natural and is exhausting for everyone. If this description seems to fit your situation, you may begin to feel that you are not an equal partner in the relationship. Others may feel you are no longer their support and refuge. To begin to change this, it is important to learn how to express yourself and to make your own position clear in each situation that requires this. When something bothers you or when people are pressuring you to do or say or feel something that you don\\'t, it takes courage not cave in. But, if you want to have a real relationship with the people around you and if you want to feel better about yourself, you must begin to say \"no.\" You must begin to challenge people when they behave in ways that are not helpful. Let\\'s focus on saying \"no.\" In the beginning, this will be hard. You may be awkward. People who are not used to asserting themselves, often say \"no\" more harshly than they intend when they first try out the word. Think of ways you can say no in a respectful but clear way by reviewing situations Gaining Self-Confidence 157 in the past when you said \"yes\" when you really meant \"no.\" How might you have responded differently? In the beginning, you may want to start with the easiest situations in which to say \"no\" in your own way. Gradually work up to the more difficult situations. As you do this, you will gain confidence in yourself and feel more in control of the things that are under your control (i.e., your decisions about where to go and what to do). Balance, Balance, Balance In all of these situations, it is important to seek balance. For example, in asking for help, try not to move from one extreme (e.g., doing it all by yourself) to the other extreme (e.g., asking others do everything). You can ask people to do certain tasks for you temporarily until you can improve your functioning. You can begin to do small things for yourself that you used to ask others to do for you. And, remember, some days, no matter how well you have followed this pain management program, you may need more help than other days. Don\\'t start saying \"no\" to everything when you never said \"no\" to anything before. Don\\'t try to be assertive with everyone at first. Take your time. Skills and capabilities need time to acquire. Learning to Problem Solve Many people assume that \"self-esteem\" is a feeling. Actually, it is a result of acting in certain ways: nurturing yourself, communicating well with others, being assertive, following through on commitments (especially to yourself), and effectively solving problems, to name a few. Here we will focus on problem solving. Problem solving is not a natural ability. It is learned. The first step in learning is to begin thinking of problems and conflicts in a different way. If you always see things from the other\\'s point of view, try thinking of the problem or conflict from a different point of view (e.g., an objective observer of the situation). If you always see things from your own point of view, try mentally walking in the shoes of the other person involved in the conflict or problem. Most problems with family and friends are communication problems. It\\'s amazing to learn how often we misinterpret other people and they misinterpret us. One of our patients found it helpful to write about such problems in letters (unsent) between herself and the other person. First she wrote about what happened (the specific behaviors, not the interpretation of the behaviors) and how she felt (not thought) about these. Then, she did the same from the point of view of the other person (again, writing about her behaviors and how the other person may have felt). Next, she visualized the benefits of having addressed the problem or conflict constructively. This three-part exercise 158 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Exhibit 8.1. The Steps of Problem Solving Step Question/Action 1. Problem identification What is the real problem or concern? 2. Goal selection How do I feel? What do I want? 3. Generation of alternatives What can I do? What else can I do? 4. Decision making Which alternative seems best? 5. Implementation How can I do this? Do it! 6. Evaluation Did it work (solve the problem)? If not, what went wrong? Return to steps 1-5. helped her stay open-minded and kept her from \"dumping\" her feelings on the other person when it was not the right time to discuss the problem or conflict. These and other problems can benefit from a more structured approach to problem solving as well. Exhibit 8.1 provides a list of stages and questions that are helpful to consider in solving any problem, particularly when you write your answers in your notebook or journal. Solving the Problem of Pain-Associated Distress Let\\'s look at this structured method with regard to pain-associated distress. First, redefine the problem (not the pain itself but some feeling, thought, or behavior) as something that is affected by the pain. For example, you might redefine the problem as a conflict with your partner over scheduling or distress about a lack of social activities in your life. Define this problem in specific terms. For example, in the case of a conflict with a partner, the problem is not \"getting along with my partner\" but \"adjusting our schedules to meet his or her needs and any limitations that I have.\" Next, define what you feel and what you want in specific terms as well. For example, in the case of lack of social activities, you might write, \"I feel lonely and not part of life. I want to have more people and activities in my life.\" Then, generate some ways of solving the problem. Brainstorm a list of at least three ways you might help solve your problem, and don\\'t edit your solutions before you even consider them. Some of our patients have found it helpful to imagine how others in similar circumstances might respond if asked to deal with a similar problem. Gaining Self-Confidence 159 From your list, for each proposed solution, evaluate the advantages and disadvantages from your point of view (and, in the case of a conflict with a person, from the point of view of that person as well). Rank the solutions in the order in which you think they might be most likely to solve the problem. Consider how you might go about putting this solution into practice. Again, it might be good to brainstorm a list. Think through how you might engage in activities to lead to a good outcome, one that resolves the problem. Then, try out what you believe would be the best and most realistic approach to solving the problem. Finally, evaluate what happened. Was it successful? Partially successful? Did it fail? If it wasn\\'t fully successful, what might you have done differently? Do you think that one of the other alternatives you generated might have worked better? Why? If the problem continues to bother you, return to steps 1-5. (For example, you may need to redefine the problem. You might add new approaches to your original list of problem solving alternatives.) In any case, remember to give yourself credit for making the effort to solve the problem in a constructive way. For example, you might say to yourself, \"I\\'ve made a good start. I\\'m not going to sit back and hope or wish the problem would go away. I\\'ll reward myself for trying and then go back to think through the problem again.\" Learning From Others You can learn a lot from people who have already attained success (not perfection) in their lives. The approach these individuals take has been studied, and what has been found is that they possess certain characteristics. These are described here: Autonomy Autonomy requires learning to set your own goals. You can involve others, but the final responsibility for your goals and your choices is yours. It also involves letting go of meeting others\\' expectations of you and being less sensitive to what others think of you. This may be harder than it at first appears, but it is an attribute worth working toward. Appropriate Risk Taking This involves being prepared to take risks. People with this characteristic focus more on what they have to gain rather than what they have to lose. Reynolds Price, author of many books 160 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE of fiction but also an account of his own serious illness (i.e., A Whole New Life) learned to take this approach when he became ill. Like other successful people who exemplify this characteristic, Price did not take unreasonable risks, but he did learn to know himself, to be realistic, to weigh outcomes, and to make choices on the basis of these factors. Realism Successful people are realistic without being drawn into pessimistic or overly optimistic thinking. They don\\'t aim too high or too low. They pick themselves up when they fail, and they evaluate what they might do better next time. They don\\'t expect to run the marathon unless they have trained systematically. Present Orientation Successful people do not dwell in the past, which they consider \"history.\" They are continually active in making realistic plans for the future and who they want to become eventually. They take initiative in making these plans become reality by experimenting in the present. Focus on Possibilities Successful people focus on possibilities. Instead of rehearsing the problem over and over, they are most involved in thinking about solutions. They develop talents that enable them to meet challenges, and this makes life seem like a challenge that is interesting and exciting. Strive for Success Successful people have the courage to strive for success, even when they encounter major obstacles, such as pain or serious illness. They realize that hope is not enough. They don\\'t have to use hope to goad them into action. Instead of focusing on fear of failure, they focus on discipline and life skills. Mistakes are seen as learning opportunities, rather than reasons to despair. Summary You can only learn to live with pain if you regain confidenceconfidence in yourself, in others, and in the future. This lesson has reviewed some of the earlier lessons and outlined Gaining Self-Confidence 161 a number of other ways to regain self-confidence. Read the lesson again when you are feeling down or a bit hopeless. Each time you read it, you may take in a little more. Activities That Can Help Critical Activities 1. List two problems that you have been struggling with recently. (1) (2) Now, use the steps in problem solving described on pages 157-158 and in Exhibit 8.1 to work on these. Write out the steps and your responses in your journal or notebook. Put your solution into practice and evaluate what went right and what went wrong. Make sure you reward yourself for trying, even if the outcome is less than you hoped it would be 2. Think of a conflict or a problem that you have recently had that involved someone else. Use the same problem-solving steps that you did in the previous activity and record your work in your journal or notebook. 3. If you are unassertive, reread the section on assertiveness. Try saying no to a person you feel safe with. Then, as your confidence in this capability grows, begin saying no to people who tend to intimidate you. Optional Activities 4. Consider the following question: Today, in which stage of acceptance do you find yourself? a) denying that there is something wrong b) rebelling c) feeling despondent or depressed d) feeling ready to try new solutions to your problems e) accepting your situation and yourself just as you are L E S S O N 9 Putting It All Together Be not afraid of life. Believe that life is worth living and your belief will create that fact. William James A^efore you started this book, you may have assumed that your pain was solely the -/_-/ result of some physical damage in your body. We have tried to emphasize that physical factors definitely are involved. However, as you have seen as the lessons progressed, there are other elements that contribute both to your pain and the effect that of pain on your physical and emotional functioning. In this lesson, we bring together all the new insights and behaviors we have shared throughout the book, and we add a few more, such as the effect of the past on the present, problems with motivation, and the finer points of setting goals. Because knowledge is power, we want you to have as much power as you can with regard to your pain and your life. We also are going to stress the importance of humor and taking things less seriously. As the cartoon character Pogo said, \"Don\\'t take life too seriously ... it ain\\'t nohow permanent.\" Nonetheless, we will start this lesson on a serious note. Awareness of what we are going to discuss will pave the way for a more joyful and less serious approach to life. Pain: Past, Present, and Future Previous pain experiences can influence your current experience of pain and the thoughts and feelings that are associated with that pain. If you ever had to leave a job under adverse conditions (e.g., a layoff, being fired), you probably will never forget the emotions that you experienced. Even after several years in a new workplace, if problems arise you are likely to 164 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE experience, consciously or unconsciously, a level of anxious arousal. It is as if stressful memories predispose us to experience anxiety in situations that are similar later on. If you have had surgery or if you have had some gruesome experiences with regard to pain (including perhaps some insensitive health care providers), some mental (as well as possibly physical) symptoms are likely still there. These serve as reminders of the distress you experienced. In other words, when you experience pain in the present, you are likely to also experience the effects of memories from previous pain experiences. However, memory and pain cause distortions. If your pain is very severe now, you may recall your previous pain being less severe. If the pain you feel now is mild, you may recall that the pain you used to experience was worse. Your present pain becomes the anchor by which you judge what your pain used to be like and what you anticipate it will be like in the future. These perceptions feel as if they are true, regardless of objective reality. Your present pain can also influence what you anticipate (What if this pain gets even worse?) and consequently cause you to limit your activities to prevent pain in the future. However, as we have seen, anxiety and worry open the pain gate, so these anticipations are important to work with (e.g., as described in lesson 7). It may also be the case that your feelings of pain are telling you something about the presentthe here and now. Your body does not protest without reason. Maybe there is too little harmony, security, and balance in your life. It could be that the relationship between your coping resources and ability (what you are able to bear) and your burden (what you have to bear) is out of balance. Numerous other factors in the present can cause your pain to increasefamily problems, emotional upset, worry, lack of understanding from your significant others, financial or work problems, or inappropriate activities, to name only a few we have previously described. The pain in the present is telling you to take stock and to shore up your resources (including your coping capabilities). Even experiences from the past that are unrelated to pain can influence your reaction to pain. The laws of learning we discussed do not just apply to physical pain. The laws of learning help shape our character (i.e., our habitual ways of being and behaving). Are we flexible or rigid? Are we comfortable with some emotions (e.g., sadness) but not others (e.g., anger)? Do we resemble our parents, family members, or other strong authority figures in our ways of dealing with emotions? We are aware of and can remember only a small proportion of these previous learning experiences. It is the especially negative or distressing experiences that we push out of our conscious memory. This is a matter of survival. Most of us cannot be consciously aware of all the sadness, loneliness, fear, and pain that we have experienced in our lives. Nevertheless, a negative atmosphere growing up, traumatic experiences, and poor coping models do leave their mark. The more intense the experience, the more pain in the family, the greater the influence. Putting It All Together 165 Feelings, as an adult, that you are not allowed to be weak, sick, or afraid of being dependent can be a result of experiences you had growing up. For example, if as a child you had to carry a lot of responsibility in order to survive, then you may find it difficult later as an adult to let go of control with confidence. How might this work in your present life? Let\\'s say you did have to carry too much responsibility as a child. Now, you may have difficulty asking for help. After you have hurt yourself doing something you weren\\'t ready to do, you might also find yourself saying, \"Why am I so stupid? Why did I have to do it all on my own? I should have asked for help.\" If you were consciously aware in the present of all that had happened to you in the past, you would know that your pattern of independence is understandable. There was likely a period of time when you had to do it all by yourself. You had to do this to survive and function. In other words, in the past there were circumstances in which that independent streak was very appropriate, but now it may be causing you difficulty. You Have More Power as an Adult The good news is that as a more consciously aware adult you have more power to create a safe, enjoyable environment in which you can learn more adaptive skills. Some people assume that \"you can\\'t teach an old dog new tricks.\" Some \"experts\" even proclaim that our character is formed by 3 years of age. But studies have shown that people can change throughout life. People can change in their 90s! Think about how your pain may have influenced your personality. Likely, it began when you were an adult. Many people we have treated have told us, \"I am not the same person I was prior to the start of my pain.\" Well, positive changes can happen as a result of pain as well. You may know people who claim they can\\'t change. It is true that people differ in their degrees of ability to change. Each person has different learning histories that shape who they are. The \"hardware\" (the brain) is roughly the same for most people. But the \"software\" (past experiences; thinking, feeling, and behavior patterns) is uniquely different for each one of us. Initially you were \"programmed\" by your genes, family, and community environment. As you grew up, you began to develop your own preferences; goals; and styles of thinking, feeling, and behaving. The initial software programs, although never entirely erased, can be modified with life experiences. Many people hate particular programs or patterns they see in themselves or in others. Alcoholics, chain smokers, drug addicts, and pain patients (in contrast to people who have pain) may intensely dislike many aspects of themselves or their current lives, but they feel helpless to change. They have yet to take responsibility for their own lives. 166 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE As the author James Allen stated, Each is the architect of his own personality. Not the circumstances, not the problems, not the pain, but the way in which we deal with it, determines our sense of happiness. Happiness is not the absence of pain and cares. Taking Charge of Your Patterns Before you experienced chronic pain, you were used to functioning in a particular way. After the pain, you became used to functioning in a different way. Both lifestyles were a set of habits, a part of who you were or are. Most people are attached to their habits, even if they are not good habits. And, as we said, habits are sometimes formed during particular periods of your life and may be difficult to let go of when you reach another period For example, in young adulthood, it may be necessary and even desirable for people to work really hard. When they retire, unless they have prepared for this transition, they can have a most difficult time and can cause difficulties for those around them. Pain can have similar results, and that is why we have stressed changing your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, even if this takes you out of your habitual \"comfort zone.\" If you do not adapt constructively, you can make life harder for yourself and for those around you. Even good habits can become destructive when followed too rigidly. For example, we have stressed that it is a good idea to spread your work in or outside of the home, your chores, your physical activities, and your errands over the week rather than trying to accomplish them all in one day. Organizing your activities in this way offers important advantages. You accomplish just as much (if not more) but with less strain. However, if this good habit becomes the driver and you the passenger, even a paced schedule can become a problem. For example, if you have found it helpful to tidy the kitchen thoroughly on a Saturday (rather than trying to clean the whole house that day), and you have a bad day on Saturday, you may feel that you have to tidy the kitchen anyway. You may have decided this not because it is necessary, but because it is Saturday. Your habit, rather than your real need, has become the driver in your life. Flexibility must be a part of a well-balanced life. If you want to change bad habits, a few strategies can be helpful. Ask yourself what this habit helps maintain (fear, pride, perfectionism?). If these feelings are difficult to work through, you might find it helpful to see a counselor for a few sessions. However, what is not helpful with a difficult habit is simply to excuse it by saying \"That\\'s just the way I am.\" That excuse will give you a temporary out, but in the long run it will defeat you. What is most helpful is to prioritize the habits you want to change and choose one habit to change at a time using the methods we have outlined in this book. The following discussion will be helpful in using all the methods we have discussed. Putting It All Together 167 Motivation 201 Earlier in the book we described why and how to get motivated to make changes. Let\\'s call that Motivation 101. This is the next level in learning about that topicMotivation 201. Let\\'s review first. The amount of effort that you are willing to put in to reach any goal is your motivation. The strength of your motivation is determined by the following: + The clarity of your goal: Exactly what do you want? ^ The attractiveness of your goal: What are the benefits to you? + The perceived and actual feasibility of your goal: Is it possible or is it realistic, given your current limitations? ^ Your skill level: Do you have the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve your goal? ^ Your willingness to persevere: Do you have the courage to continue despite occasional setbacks? Many people with chronic pain say, \"I would do anything to get rid of the pain.\" But they actually lack what they need to change. Often, they may lack motivation. If you are having difficult putting the lessons in this book into practice, you might review the list above to see if motivation is a problem for you. The Seasons Change, and So Do You Try to keep in mind that what you find enjoyable today, this week, or this month may not always be enjoyable. The things that bring us joy are not constants. Sometimes, social contacts bring us joy; other times, solitary pursuits (e.g., hobbies, prayer, meditation) bring us greater joy. Some people use enjoyable activities to motivate themselves to do things that aren\\'t enjoyable (e.g., phoning a friend after they have taken a walk that they didn\\'t look forward to). But after a while, they find that the prospect of the phone call no longer helps them over the hurdle of walking when they don\\'t \"feel like\" walking. Then, it is time to think of new ways of bringing oneself joy. If your joy recipes are limited, then you have less with which to spice up your life. That is why it is helpful to sample regularly from the menu of life\\'s small joys. Other ways of staying motivated include becoming more knowledgeable over time. We have stressed throughout this book the importance of both others\\' knowledge about pain and your own personal knowledge of pain. It helps to update your knowledge bank from reputable sources when you are feeling bored with your pain management program. 168 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE But it is also helpful to gain knowledge in any area in order to keep your mind sharp and your interests lively. It is best to do this when you are not in a down period or having a bad day. It\\'s hard to motivate oneself to learn a new skill or body of knowledge when things are going poorly. Instead, when things are going well or you are having a good day, begin to think about what you would like to learn to do or what you would like to study. Some television can be relaxing, but a daily overdose of television can be deadly to mind and spirit. Perhaps you have always been interested in the history of quilting, but have never found the time to explore this. Perhaps your interests are in archaeology. Don\\'t feel you have to have training or a college education to explore your interests. Just begin where you are and build knowledge and skills that will later serve as resources when other areas of your life are not so good. What does this have to do with pain? When pain is unavoidable, distraction can be one\\'s most useful ally. However, you must become acquainted with your ally when you are not in pain in order to feel comfortable turning to your ally when distraction is truly needed. Motivational problems sometimes stem from not knowing how to set goals. Although we cover the basics of this topic in lesson 2, there are some finer points that you may want to consider. The Mechanics of Goal Setting Remember that most people need both short-term and long-term goals to feel successful. It is helpful to formulate your goals in terms of daily, weekly, monthly, biannual, and annual goals. It is also critical that you formulate your goals in terms of effort, not in terms of results. This is because we have control over our efforts, but we do not have complete control over the results (although some patterns of effort are more associated with success than others, e.g., pacing). Place your goals, especially your daily, weekly, and monthly goals, in a prominent place, so you are reminded on a daily basis of what you are trying to do. Periodically review your monthly and annual goals to remind yourself of what you are working toward. Making copies of the activity, relaxation, and progress charts provided early in this book are useful tools to keep track of progress toward goals. These, too, can be posted in prominent places, and a notebook containing tabs for each month can help you keep track of progress in your thinking and behavior. Most people find that it helps to have an attractive or personally meaningful cover for their journal or their notebook in which they keep their goals and progress charts, so that they are apt to keep it out to review regularly. A three-ring binder that allows you to insert Putting It All Together 169 a picture or some other item on the front cover allows for changes over time. These can be found in most office supply stores. As you see progress in moving closer to achieving your goals, your motivation will increase. When you see connections between helpful patterns and positive benefits, your motivation will increase as well. The sense of accomplishment (i.e., consistent efforts) will help build self-esteem. Our patients have taught us that goals work like magnets. The closer they get to them, the stronger the attraction. Summary Pain is an important messenger, and pain management is the critical skill you need to decode your pain\\'s message and thrive despite the pain. That, in a nutshell, is what this book is all about. Some of you may have read this book without doing any of the activities. That\\'s okay for now. Your timing may be off with regard to change, and you may need to come back to this book at a later time when you are more ready. But keep this book in a safe place. We are here to work with you when you feel able to do so. Others of you may have been working through the book consistently. You have likely seen changes in your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors first and in your experience of pain next. For these readers, we offer a last lesson on maintaining the positive changes that have been achieved by following the lessons in this program. As most dieters know, the initial pounds are easier to lose than the later ones. And keeping weight off for good is more difficult than losing it in the first place. So, please don\\'t skip the next lesson. It\\'s just as important as the rest. Activities That Can Help Critical Activities 1. Think about a habit of yours that has been difficult to change. Then, list some of the ways to motivate yourself that we describe in this lesson. Pick one or two and try them for at least 6 weeks (it takes at least 6 weeks to change an ingrained habit). At the end of that time, record in your notebook or journal how and why you were successful in changing. 2. If you are one of the readers who has not tried any of the activities so far, consider why this is so. Are you going through a very demanding time but will do the activities as 170 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE soon as you can catch your breath? Do you tend to put yourself last on your list of priorities and perhaps need to rethink that? Do you tend to procrastinate and need to work on that? Or are you one of those people we found depicted in a cartoon once: Given the choice of entering the door marked \"heaven\" and entering the door marked \"reading about heaven,\" do you tend to choose the latter? If so, have a laugh at yourself and turn to the activities at the beginning of lesson 1. 3. If you have discovered particular problems with regard to your past that may be contributing to your difficulty in practicing this program, write about these in your journal or notebook. If you are still having problems, consider short-term counseling with a therapist familiar with pain management as well as with general problems of the past influencing the present. Optional Activities 4. Choose one or two of the suggested readings or audio programs listed at the end of this book. Check them out from the library or order them from your local bookstore or on the Internet. L E S S O N 1 0 The Importance of Maintenance and \"Setbacks\" Change is a process, not a discrete event. uccess in managing pain is dependent on an individual\\'s capacity to adjust and to make changes as needed. For chronic pain, we have seen that changes may be necessary in just about every area of lifeyour daily activity and rest habits, the way you choose to think about your pain, and the way you relate to others, to name only a few. In this lesson, we stress maintenance, which is the last step in the pain management program. We review the three most important pain management principles. We also discuss how periodic relapses are in some sense normal, although we help you to experience as few setbacks and relapses as possible. The Top Three Pain Management Principles Principle 1: Bringing More Physical Activity or Exercise Into Your Life Pain reduction comes about when you are reasonably able to exert yourself physically despite some discomfort or pain. Exercising within your limits can be therapeutic both physically and mentally. The keys to success in this regard are being active regularly and consistently. Our patients have taught us that if they establish a schedule and stick with it, they invariably feel pain less often and less intensely. 172 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Principle 2: Ensuring Sufficient Relaxation Pain reduction occurs when you are able to relax despite the pain. Acceptance and peace can\\'t coexist with struggle and tension. Our patients have taught us that balancing activity and rest and finding time each day for relaxation and enjoyment are crucial to pain management. Principle 3: Bringing More Diversion and Fun Into Life Pain needs competitiondiversions that help you focus on the things that are going well in your life or that create opportunities for well-being mentally and emotionally. This changes the scene from pain in the foreground and life in the background to life in the forefront and pain to the rear. Our patients have taught us that boredom and being stuck in a rut are roadblocks to successful pain management. Most people find the first two principles the easier ones (note we do not say \"easy\") to implement. The third principle gives many people the most problems. Consider the case of Fred. Fred had significant pain problems when his wife suddenly died. He was barely able to provide essential care for his three children. One evening, his son approached him about helping with a school project. Fred rudely sent him awayhe was preoccupied with his pain and his loss. However, his son kept on badgering him. Troubled by vague guilt feelings about not paying attention to his children, Fred decided to try to get involved in the school project. He soon found that it was more complicated than he would have thought. He decided to break the project into manageable segments. Fred worked on the project with his son for half an hour before his son had to go to bed. Fred promised that he would continue to work on the project. It took him until two o\\'clock in the morning. Fred felt a sense of satisfaction. He crept upstairs and proudly placed the finished project next to his son\\'s bed. While working on the school project, Fred did not focus on his pain. The pain did not disappear, but it faded into the background. It was no longer the focus of his attention. You need the healthy tension that is realized by social contact, creativity, and, yes, fun. Fun, as Fred learned, can be as unpredictable as the weather. One just has to decide to \"go outside\" of oneself to discover it. Developing hobbies, stimulating creativity, deepening social contacts, playing games, becoming adventuresome, talking, laughing, and even reading and writing can bring fun and color into your life For each person, what is fun will differ. Some find satisfaction in quiet pursuits, whereas others like the hustle and bustle of being in a crowd. If you are having difficulty with this pain management principle, remember to seek activities that fit you, but don\\'t be afraid to step out of your comfort zone once in a while. Here are some additional pointers: Maintenance and \"Setbacks\" 173 + Are you especially interested in concrete things? Are you practical? Activities such as crafts, car or motor repair, model building, sewing, woodworking, and quilting are practical and creative as well. + Do you enjoy learning new things? Activities such as chess, bridge, crossword puzzles, and Scrabble often appeal to people who like to stretch their minds and learn new things. Other food for the mind can be found in libraries and on the Internet. (Be cautious with the Internet, however. There is also a lot of \"junk food\" online as well.) Mentally, you can go on voyages of discovery to far away, foreign regions; you can go back in time, to earlier civilizations; you can share the thoughts of the great thinkers; you can bury yourself in countless subjects or specialize. Especially when you are less able to be continuously physically active, enriching your mind can be a powerful antidote to pain. + Do you have artistic interests? Activities such as drawing, painting, music, drama, and literature are examples of artistic interests. You don\\'t have to actually \"create\" to be creative. You can simply enjoy the creations of others. Being artistic includes \"being\" as well as doing. If you haven\\'t considered such activities before, try to have an open mind. Try out different areas. There is a saying that is apt here: \"The unknown is unloved.\" + Are you interested in social activities? Volunteer work of all kinds, club membership, community center activities, special interest groups, or classes are examples of \"fun\" that might appeal to you once you\\'ve given them a chance. If you have a talent for organizing, volunteering for service clubs, political parties, community action groups, and the like, there are many opportunities for you to have fun doing what you do best. The main thing is to ensure that you have people in your life and that you keep meeting new people periodically. If getting around town is too difficult, write letters, telephone people, ask them to drop by. People are unlikely to visit unless invited. Take the initiative on your good days; later, even on your bad days you will find social companionship comforting. + Do you like to work with numbers? Activities include starting collections, volunteering to be the treasurer for an interest group, joining or helping set up an investment club, and so forth. + Do you have interests in nature? Are you interested in everything that lives and grows? You might choose to put some effort into container gardening, keeping an aquarium or terrarium, keeping a pet bird or cat (but not both!), putting together a herbarium, fishing, and ecological activities, among others. In Exhibit 10.1, we include some additional examples of different activities that were suggested by our patients. By no means should these be viewed as a complete list of interests and activities. You may have some ideas that are very enjoyable that we have not even hinted 174 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Exhibit 10.1.

Box 850, Rocklin, CA 95677, http://www.theacpa.org/ at. Many others that we list will be of no interest to you whatsoever. What is important is for you to have a list of enjoyable activities that fit you and from which you can choose on a daily basis. To sum up, when you can no longer perform what used to be your \"normal activities,\" you will likely have a sense of empty space in your life. If nothing pleasurable is found to replace these activities, negative emotions such as irritability, depression, or sadness may fill up this space. Sometimes it takes a serious jolt to be released from these emotions. Then, unexpected sources of strength and energy are found. The case of Eileen below shows how this happened to one of our patients. We hope that you won\\'t wait for such an event to begin enjoying life and unearthing strengths and talents that you may not even know that you possess! 176 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Eileen took part in our pain management program and was determined to improve her life. However, she was stuck. No matter what she tried, she felt her situation deteriorating. Walks became shorter; she started using crutches and eventually needed a wheelchair. A few months after starting our program, her son was involved in a serious car accident. During Eileen\\'s difficulties, her son had always been a great support. Now he needed her help. To her own surprise and those who knew her, the new task, the new demands, released unexpected energy. The \"What, How, and When\" of Staying Involved in Life When you have a clear picture of the kinds of activities that interest you, it is important to make a choice and a plan. Ask yourself concrete questions: + \"What do I want to do?\" ^ \"How will I accomplish this?\" 4 \"When will I start?\" + \"What do I need to do to get going?\" + \"What problems might get in my way?\" + \"What can I do about potential problems that I anticipate or that arise unexpectedly?\" It often helps to tell others what you want and plan to do on a daily basis. Seek advice and encouragement from others. Each evening take a look at what pleasurable activities you included in your day. How far did you get with your plans? Do your plans need adjusting? How might you bring even more pleasure into your daily life? Managing Flare-Ups Most of our patients do experience periodic episodes of worsening pain, occasional sleeplessness, and morning stiffness. These flare-ups are temporary, and, if managed well, are typically followed by improvement. When flare-ups occur, it is important to take an active approach to managing them. At first, you may feel distressed that pain has returned or gotten worse. You might worry that the pain has returned full force and will never remit. In your darkest moments, you may feel that all is lostthat the skills you learned in this book have been Maintenance and \"Setbacks\" 177 of no use whatsoever. In your brighter moments during flare-ups, you might remember what we said about Murphy\\'s Law: \"If something can go wrong it will.\" And Mrs. Murphy\\'s commentary on Murphy\\'s Law? \"Murphy was an optimist!\" But seriously, let\\'s look at causes of flare-ups. Flare-ups are sometimes caused by identifiable aggravating factors. A weekend doing too much yard work or the physical stress of repetitive motion (e.g., too many hours at the computer) may be followed by increased pain and stiffness. Emotional stress, such as conflicts with family or friends, may also exacerbate pain and lead to sleeplessness. Certain weather conditions may set off a flare-up. However, many times flare-ups occur with no identifiable cause. In these cases, it is best not to spend too much time analyzing what caused the flare-up, because this may actually increase the pain. If you do identify specific factors that clearly aggravate your pain, you can possibly reduce them in the future by avoiding or limiting certain activities, making a plan to deal differently with conflict, and so on. Before the next flare-up occurs, the most important thing you can do is to develop a personal flare-up management plan. In Exhibit 10.2, we describe a typical plan. Note that this is only one example. You are unique, and you need to develop plans specifically for you. It can be helpful to go over your plans with a nurse, doctor, or physical therapist. This kind of planning ahead is called relapse prevention in many fields, including pain management. After a flare-up, it is important to rest and recover (for a reasonable, limited time while still maintaining activity using your pacing skills). It is also important to review what was effective and to commend and comfort yourself for having weathered the increased pain. Exhibit 10.2. Sample Flare-Up Management Plan + Change activity-rest cycle to decrease activities by one half. ^ Cut back on physical exercises by a certain amountcheck with a physical therapist to determine amount. ^ Over 3 days, gradually increase activities up to level prior to flare-up. + Practice relaxation and controlled breathing exercises twice as often as before flare-up. ^ Increase use of other pain coping skills such as distraction, imagery, and positive thoughts. ^ Increase frequency of relaxing activities. ^ Inform family that you are having a flare-up and what you will be doing about it. ^ Tell significant others what they can do to help you during the flare-up. 178 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE But what do I do during a flare-up? This is a reasonable question. During a flare-up, relying on your newly developed qualities, such as acceptance, is critical. Remembering that pain and distress are a necessary part of life and that they cannot be entirely avoided can be helpful. Remembering that you are not alone in the world of chronic pain is helpful as well. Acceptance of pain when you are having extremely high levels of discomfort is never easy. But our patients have taught us that if they try to observe the pain without trying to change it, they feel better than when they are frantically seeking control over the pain. They have told us that it is better to observe their thoughts and feelings than to act on them impulsively. They have told us that acceptance may not decrease pain, but it may decrease suffering. You may have heard the adage, \"Pain is necessary, but suffering is optional.\" Pain and suffering are not the same thing. Pain is the physical hurt you feel; suffering is when you tell yourself lies about pain (e.g., it will never go away) and judge yourself harshly for having pain. Suffering is when you blame other people who are not to blame or when you try to control people, places, or things that are not under your control. Pain is unavoidable at times. Suffering is a result of the lack of acceptance of that pain and associated feelings and emotions. Suffering also occurs when you forget that there is more to life than even intense pain. Suffering decreases by engaging in pleasurable activities that soothe and satisfy your senses, such as listening to music, stroking a pet, watching a relaxing show on television, burning a candle with an aroma you enjoy, having a cup of your favorite fruit or ice cream, or getting or giving a massage (even a foot massage can be highly pleasurable). When you find out that you are able to put your flare-up management plan into action, that you are able to bring rest, harmony and also fun back into your life, despite pain, then you know that you are accepting life on life\\'s terms. While you may be in pain, you will not necessarily be suffering! You will identify with the prayer with which we began this book: \"Grant me the SERENITY to accept the things I cannot change; COURAGE to change things I can; and WISDOM to know the difference.\" A Final Word Your investment of time and energy in this pain management program and your commitment to your own well-being have made you a different person than you were when we first met you in this book. Regardless of flare-ups, setbacks, and other unexpected challenges, what you have accomplished is IRREVERSIBLE! We encourage you to return to review the different lessons periodically, because you may find new things each time you reread a lesson. We have shared a tremendous amount of information. We hope to hear from you about what worked and what didn\\'t! Remember, we\\'re all in this together! (And yes, there is homework in this lesson as well. Darn!) Maintenance and \"Setbacks\" 179 We have listed key points of this self-management program. You might want to copy it and place it someplace where you will see it frequently so that it can serve as a reminder. Key Points to Remember ^ Be alert to the erroneous myths about pain. * Pain is not a reliable signal of injury. * The absence of injury or disease does not mean that your pain is not realAll pain is real. * Your pain should be taken seriously. * There is a no pill for every ill, \"when in doubt cut it out\" is not a useful way to treat chronic pain. * Hurt and harm are not equal. * If you have had pain for a long time, there is much you can do about ityou are not helpless and hopeless. ^ Know your limitsbalance overload and underload to find the optimal load for you. + You are a person not a patient\\\\ + Maintain a regular exercise plan that gradually increases until you reach an optimal level; stay with it; keep charts where you record the amount of your exercise. ^ Move it or lose it!, but exercise smarter not harder. + Pacing of activity and energy is important, balance activity and rest (relaxation). ^ Maintain a regular sleep schedule. ^ Practice relaxation and controlled breathing exercises on a daily basis. + Increase pleasant activities. ^ Communicate with significant othersrely on sharing, not mind-reading. + Be aware of the Laws of Learning and the role of attention, anticipation, and fear. + Thoughts, feeling, behavior, and the body are related. The pain gate can be open or closed by each of them. + Change painful thoughts into realistic ones. + Build up your \"wants\" and avoid the \"Tyranny of Shoulds and Musts.\" + Accept yourself and your limitations; the new you may be different from the old but not worse. + Reward yourself for your efforts and not just the results. + Expect relapses, setbacks, and bad days, but do not let them defeat you! Be yourself, act like yourself, and like yourself, so you can take good care of yourself! 180 THE PAIN SURVIVAL GUIDE Activities That Can Help 1. Make three plans. a. A plan to systematically become more active over time (indicate what, when, where, how much, and for how long). b. A plan to bring even more fun and relaxation into your life (indicate what, when, where, how much, and for how long). c. A plan to deal with inevitable flare-ups (i.e., your relapse prevention plan). List the options, skills, and techniques you can use. Be as specific as you can. Place this in a prominent location so that you can refer to it immediately when you need to.  COMMUNICATION TRAINING  I.\\tGood communication requires: \\tA speaker who is able to effectively communicate the intended message and \\tA listener who is able to understand the intended message.  \\tThe specific rules for being an effective listener and communicator are very important to your ability to develop positive intimate relationships.  II.\\tTwo General Modes of Communication\\tThere are two general modes of communication.   A.\\tThe feeling expression mode is when the speaker is looking only for support and understanding from the listener.   B.\\tThe problem solving mode is when the speaker is raising a concern for the purpose of solving a problem.  III.\\tListening Skills During the Feeling Expression Mode of Communication\\tThe intent of some communications are simply because the speaker wants to tell the listener how he or she feels without necessarily wanting to figure out a solution at that moment.  At these times the speaker is looking for support and understanding from the listener.  \\tTherefore, to be a good listener, it is important to discriminate between:  A.\\tThe times when the intent of the communication is to express feelings (at which time validation without problem-solving is appropriate) and B.\\t When the intent is to come up with a solution to a problem (at which time both validation and problem solving are appropriate). C.\\tWhen the intent is to express feelings, the listener should: 1.\\tListen actively (demonstrate by your body posture, and facial expression that you are listening). 2.\\tParaphrase-summarize the speaker\\'s remarks and check your accuracy. ?\\tParaphrasing Example: a.\\tSpeaker: I had the worst day.  I found out that JoAnne, who I thought was my friend, has been dating Jeff behind my back, even though she knows that I have had a huge crush on him ever since I met him.  Of all the people she could date, she had to choose him!  I feel so hurt that she never even let on that she was doing this. b.\\tListener:  So you are feeling betrayed and disappointed because someone you had confided in and trusted, has been listening to you talk about your crush on Jeff and never even bothered to tell you that she was dating him. 3.\\t Reflect- Communication contains both a content and a feeling component.  The content is what the person says and the feeling refers to the underlying affect.  Reflection requires you to listen well enough to summarize both the content and feeling that the speaker is trying to communicate (e.g. So you are feeling angry and devalued because your boss didn\\'t give you the promotion).   ?\\tAsk open-ended questions if you don\\'t understand the speaker\\'s feelings or thoughts and check your accuracy (e.g., What is it about this situation that bothers you?). 4.\\tValidate:  Try to get into the speaker\\'s shoes and see how, given the assumptions that he or she is making, it is reasonable for him/her to feel the way that he or she feels.  Communicate your understanding and acceptance of the speaker\\'s expression as legitimate feelings.   ?\\tIt is important to emphasize that a communication that you can understand the speaker\\'s point of view does not require you to agree with him or her, and it does not have to mean that you would have the same emotional response under the same circumstances.  However, each individual\\'s emotional response is always legitimate (e.g., never say,you shouldn\\'t feel that way) and as a good listener, you will make the effort to try to understand how they feel.   ?\\tA validation means that given the interpretations that the speaker has made, you can understand how he or she might feel the way that they do.  (E.g.,So you feel left out when I talk to my friends about shared experiences that don\\'t include you. Is that right?).   ?\\tValidation is a very important listener skill when the speaker is looking for support and understanding. 5.\\tCheck Impact: Check to be sure that your understanding of what the speaker has expressed is correct.  Do not fill in the gaps with guesses as to what the speaker is thinking or feeling without asking whether you are correct.  Do not mind-read. 6.\\tDo not attempt to give the speaker solutions.  Simply paraphrase, reflect, validate, and check impact. IV.\\tSpeaker Skills for the Feeling Expression Mode of Communication A.\\tThink about your reasons for communicating.  Determine that your intent is to communicate your feelings and that you are not looking for solutions, but validation. B.\\tExpress your own feelings about the topic usingI statements.\\tExample:I am feeling angry and hurt rather thanyou make me feel angry and hurt.\\tRemember that other people are not responsible for how you feel. C.\\tSpeak clearly: Try to think about what you are feeling and how best to communicate these feelings.  Understand that if the listener misinterprets the speaker\\'s communication, it may be due to a lack of clarity on the part of the speaker. D.\\tCheck to make sure that the listener understood what you were trying to communicate.\\tExample:Do you understand why I am upset? V.\\tSpeaker Skills During Problem-solving Mode of Communication A.\\tLeveling-\\tIt is necessary to let the listener know what your feelings and thoughts are if you want to develop or to maintain a close relationship.  This is difficult for some people who fear that expression of feelings will evoke catastrophic results.  At certain times, however, if you respect your own needs and desires you will be easier to like and to love.  Therefore, leveling means that you will take the risk of stating your thoughts and feelings and of sometimes being assertive.\\tExample:When you tell me that you are going to call me on a certain day, and then you don\\'t follow through, I feel hurt and depressed. When you don\\'t do anything special to acknowledge my birthday, I feel as though you don\\'t care about me.\\tLeveling requires 4 steps: 1.\\tKnow what you are feeling 2.\\tKnow that what you want and need is important 3.\\tMake things a two-way street ?\\tLearn to ask for favors as well as to give them.  The person who is all-giving will become resentful. 4.\\tAnnounce your Filter ?\\tLearn to recognize the impact that you may have and what the consequence my be by stating your feelings. a.\\tExample:I\\'ve had a hard day, and if I appear angry, it is not directed at you.  It would be best if I were alone for awhile\\tHow to Level Constructively 1.\\tChoose important legitimate issues that are worth discussing with the goal of problem-solving. 2.\\tChoose an appropriate time and place to introduce the topic. Be sure there is enough time to engage in a complete and full discussion of the problem. 3.\\tChoose one specific important gripe.   ?\\tDo not store up grievances to be let out all at once.  (i.e., no kitchen-sinking, or airing of old resentments). 4.\\tStick to one issue at a time (no cross-complaining or countering the speaker\\'s complaints with some of your own). 5.\\tDo not insult or put the other person down ?\\tExample:If you can\\'t figure that out you are pretty stupid 6.\\tDo not threaten the listener. ?\\tExample:If you do that one more time we\\'re through 7.\\tBe specific: ?\\tAlways use the following structure: a.\\tWhen you do x, in situation y, I feel z b.\\tFor example,When you promise to go somewhere with me, and then back out, I feel hurt. c.\\tWhen doing this choose vulnerable emotions (hurt, rejection) over attacking emotions (anger) 8.\\tDo not Use Generalizations: ?\\tExamples: Do not use any statements that begin withyou always oryou never 9.\\tStick to the behavior, don\\'t use words that imply personality traits or character flaws ?\\tExamples:You are so irresponsible, undependable, lazy, etc ?\\tIf you act as though it is a trait, the other person may feel as though it will be very hard or impossible for them to change your opinion of them, so why bother. ?\\tReference to a specific behavior feels easier to change. 10.\\t Stick to thehere and now ?\\tDon\\'t bring up past grievances or long lists of examples of previous behaviors that demonstrate the problem. 11.\\t UseI statements and express your own feelings ?\\tExample:I feel discounted when you don\\'t pick up after yourself B.\\tDefining the Problem 1.\\tMention something about the other person that you honestly like before mentioning the behavior that is currently upsetting you.  Try to make the praise related to the problem ?\\tExample: In many ways you are the best roommate that I have ever had and you are so considerate of my needs and feelings.  That is why I was so hurt when you went out with your friends from home and didn\\'t invite me to come with you 2.\\tDescribe clearly and specifically  a.\\tthe undesirable Behavior,  b.\\tthe situations where they occur,  c.\\tand the consequences of the problem for you. 3.\\tTry to have an example of a time when the problematic behavior occurred. ?\\tThere is no need to list example after example ?\\tIt is also unnecessary to make an attribution about what the past cause of the problem may be. ?\\tExample,I like it when you hold me while we watch TV, but I feel rejected when you aren\\'t physically affectionate in public). 4.\\tFollow the rules for constructive leveling. 5.\\tIf the listener\\'s summary statement (paraphrase, reflection, and validation) is not accurate, correct the inaccuracy by using different words to describe what you wanted to communicate. ?\\tExample:I don\\'t think you understand why I am upset, let me try to explain it in a way that you might be able to understand 6.\\tAdmit your role, or contribution to the problem. ?\\tExample:I think that I contributed to this misunderstanding by expecting you to read my mind about what I wanted when I could have been more direct about my preferences. 7.\\tDiscuss only one problem at a time 8.\\tDon\\'t make inferences about the other person\\'s motivation/intentions. ?\\tExample:You did that to punish me ?\\tTalk only about behavior you can observe ?\\tYou know the other person\\'s intentions only through their behavior and only the behavior can upset you.  Therefore, your problems are solved if the behavior changes, so don\\'t worry about their intentions. 9.\\tBegin by turning specific negative gripes into suggestions for increasing positive behavior. ?\\tExample:  Instead of saying,I hate it when you don\\'t kiss me hello when you come home from work.  sayI would really like it if you would kiss me hello when you come home from work. 10.\\tMake suggestions about behavior changes that you can make in order to help the listener change his/her behavior. ?\\tExample: What about if I made the effort not to nag you about your household responsibilities, and maybe you could try to remember to pick up after yourself. 11.\\tAsk the listener for feedback on your impact ?\\tExample: It would help me if you could paraphrase what your understanding is of what I just said 12.\\tGive positive feedback for appropriate responses by your partner. ?\\tExample:It means a lot to me that you are willing to try to understand why this behavior hurts me 13.\\tDon\\'t Expect Sweeping Changes ?\\tStart with less than what you would ideally want, but something that seems possible to your partner. a.\\tExample:How about if you could spend 10 minutes talking with me about how my day went VI.\\tProblem-solving Listener Skills B.\\tDefining the Problem:\\tThe goal of Defining the problem is for both parties to agree upon and to come to a shared definition/understanding of what the problem is, and how it may be hurtful to one or both parties in the relationship.\\tDuring the problem definition phase, it is important for each listener to adhere to the following rules: 1.\\tListen to and Accept the Speaker\\'s Complaints as Legitimate Feelings. 2.\\tReceive every statement made by the speaker by  a.\\tparaphrasing, reflecting, and validating.  b.\\tCheck to be sure that you are correct.   c.\\tThen ask,What can we do about that? 3.\\tBe careful that when you are validating your partner\\'s feelings that you are trying to understand how he or she feels.  Do not read between the lines or attribute motives or intentions. 4.\\tDo not respond withyes-butwhen a suggestion is made or a point of view is stated.  This communicates a rejection of the other person\\'s point of view. 5.\\tListen actively and demonstrate this by your body posture and facial expression. 6.\\tAsk open-ended questions when you don\\'t understand what your partner is trying to communicate. 7.\\tGive feedback about your own feelings. ?\\tRemember to useI statements to communicate feelings, including any feelings you may have about something said by the speaker during the problem-solving session. 8.\\tDo not use present causes of the problem as an excuse, but as an aid to defining the problem. ?\\tBad Example: I wouldn\\'t use that demeaning tone of voice if you would not take so long to respond to me when I ask you something. ?\\tGood Example: I think it would help me to feel less frustrated if you would try to respond more quickly when I ask you a question 9.\\tDo not insist that your partner\\'s behavior causes your problematic behavior or suggest that your partner change before you will change.  You should agree to change independently of your partner\\'s behavior and he/she can help you change by offering to change his/her problematic behavior. 10.\\tStick to the issue at hand.  Don\\'t counter what your partner has said with another complaint. 11.\\tWhen giving feedback on the impact of the speaker, make it clear, brief, specific and on topic. ?\\tRemember that you are providing information with the goal to make things better.  Your goal is not to unload past resentments or to get even. ?\\tSo, if I understand what you are saying, you would like me to call you more frequently\\tOnce both parties have agreed about the problem definition, they should focus only on solving the problem. VII.\\tBrainstorming\\tDuring brainstorming both parties generate as many solutions to the problem as possible without regard to the quality of the solutions.  Therefore, neither party is allowed to evaluate or critique any of the suggested solutions during this period. VIII.\\tForming a change agreement 1.\\tDescribe all changes as specific behaviors 2.\\tInclude information as to when the changes will occur  3.\\tInclude information as to the expected frequency of any changes.  4.\\tRecord everything in writing in a contract 5.\\tIn the contract each party agrees to increase the frequency of a specific behavior. 6.\\tAgree on appropriate rewards for following the contract. IX.\\tEditing\\tResearch suggests that people that know each other well (married people, roommates, friends, family) are ruder to one-another than they are to strangers or acquaintances.\\tIt is important to be polite at times you are hurt and angry with each other.\\tYou must decide to be polite, regardless of your partner\\'s behavior. A.\\tHow to Edit Constructively 1.\\tIf you are asked to do a favor for someone, state what you can do and not what you can\\'t do. 2.\\tExpress sincere and positive appreciation.  Try to find something positive to say in response to your partner\\'s efforts.  Does your partner have good intentions? 3.\\tDon\\'t complain or nag 4.\\tAvoid giving compliments that are actually insults 5.\\tIf you have a specific issue to resolve, schedule a leveling session 6.\\tBe courteous and considerate.  Try to think about how the other person might feel. 7.\\tExpress interest in your partner\\'s activities; try to listen and ask questions.  Don\\'t monopolize the conversation. 8.\\tAllow your partner to finish speaking before responding. Don\\'t interrupt. 9.\\tTry to word things positively, saying things that your partner will like.  Don\\'t put your partner down. 10.\\tCriticize your ideas or behavior and not yourself.  When you put yourself down, you put the listener on the spot to either build you up or say something to support you.  Get support by asking for it directly.  It is an insult to someone who loves you to say that they are stupid enough to love a worthless person. 11.\\tFocus on the present situation.  Don\\'t bring up old resentments.  If you want something, don\\'t throw in a complaint with your request.  If you have an issue schedule a leveling session. 12.\\tThink of your partner\\'s needs and desires, not just your own; be empathic.      Almost everyone knows people who can be described as intetpersonally skillful or socially competent. These are individuals who seem to exhibit the ability to handle other people effectively and who are highly reinforcing to those with whom they interact. At a social gathering, these are the people who can easily meet others, converse effectively with them, convey and elicit information freely during conversations, and leave others with the feeling of enjoyment following the interaction. At a business meeting, this might be the person who can clearly state personal viewpoints or opinions, lead others to believe that he or she understands and appreciates their opinions, and offer disagreeing views without causing others to feel they have been attacked. During a job interview, this is the applicant who is able to convince an employer, within just minutes of time, that he or she is vocationally competent, well.rounded, diligent, re sponsible, and the ideal person to hire. Some people appear to have developed and refined a social style that permits them to achieve rewarding intetpersonal outcomes, while at the same time leaving others with favorable opinions of them; terms such as \"extroverted,\" \"socially ascendent,\" \"assertive,\" and \"socially skilled\" are all used to describe persons with these response capabilities. However, these are not the terms typically used to describe the behavior of our clients. Ranging from the pervasive social impairment observed among institutionalized persons, such as chronic psychiatric patients or the mentally retarded, to the much more well defined and situationally specific social deficits of higherfunctioning persons, it is evident that intetpersonal behavior represents a problematic area for many individuals. The modification ofclient social skills is often an important aim of therapy. Interpersonal impairment is a defining characteristic of many emotional and behavioral disorders. Bellack and Hersen (1978), for example, have noted that there are literally hundreds of theories concerning the development of schiz ophrenia. These often discrepant explanations range from biochemical to 1 2 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions dynamic to behavioral to genetic theories. Yet, regardless of the clinician\\'s theoretical position on the development of schizophrenia, almost any clinician would use anextremely uniform and consistentsetofdescriptors todescribe the behavior or appearance of a \"chronic schizophrenic.\" The \"chronic psychiatric patient\" is almost invariably described in terms of massive social deficiency: extreme nonresponsiveness to other people, withdrawal, lack of appropriate emotionalreactivity toothers, and the presence ofvarious interpersonal appearance \"cues\" that others find idiosyncratic, peculiar, or odd. It is, most prominently, the social behavior of chronic schizophrenic individuals that sets them apart from other people. As Bellack and Hersen note, it is unclear whether these social deficits are always a consequence of schizophrenia or whether they may be contributory to the diagnosis of that disorder. Similarly, there seems to be variation in whether such individuals had earlier acquired an effective socialskills repertoire, but then ceased to exhibit those skills following long-term hospitalization, or whether effective social skills had simply never been acquired during development. Those issues notwithstanding, it is apparent that ~rsons labeled as \"chronic schizophrenics\" tn?ically exhibit massive social _ \"deficits, which impair their ability to establish appropriate relationships and ..f!!!ction normally in the commllni~. Without intervention, it is unlikely that such iiiaividuals will develop friendships, fmd or hold jobs, or adapt successfully to noninstitutional environments. Similarl mentall re rsons often exhibit relativel social-skill impairl!!cmt. MStntal retardation has n conceptualized historically in terms of both intellectual subnormality and interpersonal deficiency (American Association on Mental Deficiency, 1977), and investigators have long noted that the social functioning ofretarded individuals within the mild to moderaterange ofimpairmentisasubstantialpredictor ofvocational, interpersonal, and independent-living adjustment (cf. Doll, 1953). Presumably, if skills-deficient retarded citizens could be taught more appropriate social skills, they too could be integrated more successfully into various community settings and would achieve better interpersonal acceptance among nonretarded persons. There is evidence suggesting that the greater the number of cues that an individual exhibits conveying that he or she is retarded, the more others will respond unfavorably to that person (Kelly & Drabman, 1977; Rosenberg, 1959). Thus,...@!! aim of skills-training with this client population would be to _ ~reduce interpersonal cues orbehaviors indicative ofretardation and to increase more appropriate social skills, which would facilitate the client\\'s development of reLltionships. -In me case of\"1Dstitutionalized or formerly institutionalized psychiatric patients as well as retarded persons, skills deficits may be quite pervasive, cross-situational, and strikingly apparent. ,Yet, among higher-functioning Social Skills and Psychological Adjustment: Conceptual Foundations 3 clients, interpersonal skill deficiencies can also be oblematic. Clinicians, counse ors, and thera ists have Ion observed that inte rsonal relationships are 0 n Jrect y identified by clients as reasons for seekin treatment. xamp es mc u e c lents\\' complaints 0 eir inability to form or initiate social relationships with others, social anxiety, loneliness and shyness, being rejected by others, or the inability to assert themselves when confronted with unreasonable behavior from other people. Often, very direct references to interpersonal skill difficulties are made by clients in their earliest interviews with the therapist or counselor. At other times, clients present in treatment with initial vague complaints of anxiety or depression, and it is not until somewhat later that the therapist discovers specifically that unsatisfactory interpersonal relationships are the basis for more generalized mood or anxiety-related difficulties. It is evident, then, that while some low-functioning client populations are characterized by massive social deficits that are immediately apparent upon even casual observation, difficulties in handling and establishing interpersonal relationships are reported by even high-functioning clients seen in almost any counseling or treatment setting. What Are Social Skills? We can define social skills as those identifiable, learned behaviors that indi-viduals use in interpersonaI situations to obtaIn or to maintain reinforcement from their environment. When conceptualized in this manner, social skills can essentially be viewed as behavioral pathways or avenues to an individual\\'s goals. Let us direct our attention to three aspects of this definition of social skills: (1) viewing socially skilled behavior in terms of its ability to lead to reinforcing consequences, (2) the interpersonal siwations in which social skills are exhibited, and (3) describing skilled behavior in an identifiable, objective manner. Social Skills as Behaviors That Elicit Reinforcement from the Environment One approach to categorizing or defining interpersonal skills is based on their function or utility for an individual. Some interpersonal skills serve the purpose offacilitatingtheestablishment ofrelationshipswithotherpeople. Otherskills, although used in an interpersonal context, serve to obtain goals or reinforcers that are not themselves social in nature. Still other social-skill behaviors function primarily to prevent others from removing or blocking reinforcement to which an individual is entitled. 4 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions Social Skills That Facilitate Relationship Development The establishment of relationships with other people is, for most individuals, a desired goal or rewarding experience; consequently, social relationships can be considered to be reinforcing events for most people. These interactions might include such things as dating, having friends with whom one can comfortably converse, and meeting new people easily at parties or other infonnal gatherings. However, attaining each of these desirable social goals requires that the individual first engage in a set ofrelatively well-organized skill behaviors. For example, in order to date another person, the individual wishing to attain that goal: (1) must be in a setting where potential dates can be met; (2) must initiate an appropriate conversational interaction, which provides ili\"e potenti8.1 date with a favorable impression; and (3) must make a specific request to continue or renew the interaction at a later time. Ibe constellation of these and similar-SOCial betiavlOrs that effectively lead to the establishment of dates has been tenned \"heterosocial or date-initiation skills.\" A related but more gene@ type of SOCial competency is needed for the purpose of establishing conversations or friendships with others whom one does not yet know. Here, the goal is perhaps not to obtain a date, but to have an enjoyable conversational interaction. This short-range goal of conversation is also a prerequisite to the development of closer friendship relationships, and the behaviors thatleadtothose outcomescan betenned \"conversational skills.\" In similar fashion,.\"commendatory skills,\" or \"commendatory assertion,\" haL been described as an important aspect in the establishment of si\\' lions ipSWi 0 erpoope 0pe & Lazarus, 1966). \"Commendatory skill\" refers to~the a6ihty to warmly and convincingly compliment the good actions 2f... other people, which 10 turn may foster a reciprocation of their positive re.... - sponses. Date-initiation, conversational skills, and commendatory social skills seem primarily relevant to adolescents or adults. Prosocial-play skills in young children also serve to facilitate the development of their peer relationships. Certainly, many of the behaviors that constitute effective prosocial-play skills among children are different than those adults might use to establish friendships, but the purpose is the same: to exhibit peer-valued social skills, which promote the development of relationships and the reciprocation of positive actions from others. Allofthe interpersonal skillsthatfacilitate thebuilding ofrelationshipshave in common with one another the fact that they increase the social attractiveness or reinforcement value of the person exhibiting them. Because others respond positively to individuals who are skillful in conversation, date-initiation, commendatory behavior or, in the case of children, prosocial-play skills, these Social Skills and Psychological Adjustment: Conceptual Foundations 5 competencies serve not only as avenues by which a person can initiate reinforcing relationships, but they also increase the likelihood that others will seek out further opportunities to interact with the individual. Social Skills Used in an Interpersonal Context to Bring About Nonsocial Reinforcement In some cases, socially skilled behavior serves to help an individual attain desired and reinforcing goals that are not themselves interpersonal in nature. For example, job-interview skills occur in the context of a social interactionthe interaction between the applicant and the interviewer-but the reinforcer sought by most applicants is being hired, rather than building a relationship for its own sake. Job-interview skills thus represent the constellation of social behaviors that are c able of Ieadin to the nonsocial but nonetheless im rtan rem orcer of being hired for employment. A number of investigators have ~ examined the manner In Milch Job-mtervlew skills, or the social behavior exhibited by an applicant in the job-interview situation, can influence whether or not the applicant will be hired (cf. Furman, Geller, Simon, & Kelly, 1979; Hollandsworth, Glazeski, & Dressel, 1978; Kelly, Wildman, & Berler, 1980). Social Skills That Prevent the Loss of Current Reinforcement In contrast to those skills that principally enhance a client\\'s own reinforcement value and facilitate approach responses from others, or those skills that permit a person to attain other kinds of desired nonsocial goals, different competencies may be needed to handle the unreasonable behavior of others. \"Refusal assertion\" serves such a purpose. When a person is engaged in some rewarding activity or wishes to express feelings, beliefs, or personal opinions, it is possible that others may attempt to block or inhibit that individual\\'s own goal-directed behavior. In essence, some other person would then be unreasonably attempting to remove current activities that the individual finds reinforcing, or to keep the individual from doing things that are potentially rewarding. ~usal assertion refers to those competencies that a person can use to prevent others from blocking his or her own oal-directed behavior; they rovide client WI appropriate social avenues for expressing feelings, disagreements; and requests for the antagonist to chan e his unreasonable behavior. Whl e each of these I ferent types of social skills represents strategies for obtaining reinforcement of some kind or preventing its loss, the behaviors that constitute each type of skill differ. As we will discuss in more detail shortly, many of the skill behaviors one would use to initiate a date are quite different than those one would use in a job interview. Similarly, many of the actions that 6 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions comprise an effective refusal-assertive response are not the same as the behaviors that make up the skill of assertively commending the positive conduct of another person. It is apparent, then, that a wide range of qualitatively and functionally different behaviors are subsumed under the generic term of \"social skill\" or \"social competency.\\':\\'Social-skills training derives its meaning only within the .. context of the teaching of a specific type of skill. Social-skills training denotes tJie generat treatment approach of applymg learning principles for the purpose of increasing the interpersonal competencies of clients; clinical interventions must be targeted toward a specific type of goal skill, such as refusal assertion, conversational skill, date-initiation behavior, or job-interview skill, based upon the exact nature of client deficits and needs. Situational Specificity of Social Behavior Traditional psychometric measurement of social behavior has often assumed that social competence can be represented as a single range, continuum, or dimension. For example, some measurement approaches have described a linear social-competence continuum, with high competence at one end of the range and low competence at the other (cf. Bemreuter, 1931; Cattell, Eber, & Tatsouka, 1967; Drake, 1946; Eysenck, 1947). Presumably, a given individual could then be \"located\" at some point along this dimension, usually based on responses to a self-report measure of general social competence. Similar formulations and measurement procedures have been used to create continuum models for generalized traits of introversion-extroversion, orientation toward others or away from them, social dominance versus submissiveness, and so on. However, there appear to be several major limitations associated with the conceptualization of social competency in terms of generalized, continuumlike traits. As suggested in the previous section, what we term social skill or competence is a collection of different types of skills, which are used for different purposes. There may be little correspondence between the ability ofa given individual to effectively exhibit one type of social skill and the ability of the same individual to effectively exhibit another type of social skill. Wolpe and Lazarus (1966), for example, have noted that some clients are able to effectively assert themselves when confronted with the unreasonable behavior ofan antagonist (refusal assertion), but lack the commendatory skills repertoire to communicate positive or affectionate feelings to others. Other investigators have found that training skills-deficient clients in more effective commendatory social skills largely failed to improve their ability to handle situations requiring refusal assertion (Geller, Wildman, Kelly, & Laughlin, 1980; Kelly, Frederiksen, Fitts, & Phillips, 1978). A similar situation probably exists for some college students who handle many everyday interactions successfully but Social Skills and Psychological Adjustment: Conceptual Foundations 7 lack the skills repertoire needed to present themselves effectively during employment interviews. This may be due to infrequent exposure to the jobinterview social situation and to the relatively specialized skills needed to effectively handle it.:...It appears unwarranted, then, to assume that individuals_ . will be consistently skillful across different t s of social com tency, and it may more useful to construe the various kinds ofsocial skills as functionally \\'cbscrete abthfies. 1he degree fo which a particular type of skill will be important or functional for an individual depends upon how frequently the person is in situations where that skill is needed, as well as the importance or value of the goal that can be attained by using the skill. Effective date-initiation behavior is more salient for individuals who are single and seeking to establish date relationships than for persons who are already happily married. Conversational skills may be more important for individuals who must frequently meet others than for people with a small group of friends and more solitary pursuits. Effective job-interview behavior is more salient to the individual seeking employment than to the individual who has been working contentedly at the same company for years. We would expect that individuals are likely to most develop and exhibit social skills that permit goal-attainment in situations that they encounter frequently or, conversely, we may expect that individuals are likely to experience greater dissatisfaction if they do not have the social-skills repertoire that is needed to handle those interactions that could lead to personally salient goals. There may be little necessary correspondence between an individual\\'s ability to exhibit one type of social skill and the same person\\'s ability to effectively handle situationscallingfor anotherkind ofskill; inaddition, evena single type of social skill, such as assertiveness or conversational skill, is not consistently exhibited across all situations. Mischel (1968) has argued that while clients and therapists may perceive a high degree of consistency in social behavior across different situations, objective assessment often indicates that the social behavior or skills of the same individual are determined by the situation the individual is in. Thus, a person may exhibit effective refusal-assertion skills in one situation but fail to exhibit the same skills in a different situational context. Eisler, Hersen, Miller, andBlanchard (I975)foundthatthequality ofeffective assertion among psychiatric patients varied depending upon such factors as whether the antagonist in a role-play situation was portrayed as familiar or unfamiliar to the client, whether the antagonist was a male or a female, and the circumstances surrounding the need to be assertive. Other investigators have found that clients who could generate appropriately assertive responses during role-plays of troublesome situations were considerably less effective in handling the same incident when it occurred in the natural environment (Bellack, Hersen, & Lamparski, 1979). These findings make intuitive sense. Ifwe were to observe a given individual 8 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions across various interpersonal situations in which another person behaves unreasonably towards him, we would expect to find that the manner in which the person handles an antagonist would vary, depending upon many situational variables. These might include whether the antagonist was a family member, a close friend, an acquaintance, a stranger, a co-worker, or a supervisor at work. The sex and age of the antagonist may also determine a client\\'s response; one might well behave differently toward a peer than toward a very elderly person, even if the two individuals acted identically. Cognitive factors, such as the perceived intent of the antagonist, can influence wbether an assertive response will occur and, if so, the verbal or nonverbal nature of that response. For these reasons, construing assertiveness as a generalized, cross-situational tr . appears both bebaviorally inaccurate Slm IStlC iscbel 1968. simi ar pattern of situational specificity appears likely for other types of social skills. The quality, competence, or ease of conversational interactions exhibited by a client will depend upon situational factors, including the familiarityoftheotherpersonintheconversation, thesex oftheclient,thesex ofthe partner, andthepurpose ofthe interaction (e.g., talking with astrangertopass some time at a bus stop, conversing with one\\'s boss, or conversing with the intention of asking the other person for a date). Failure to Exhibit Socially Skilled Behavior An individual\\'s failure to exhibit socially skilled behavior in a given situation can be explained in a number of different ways, as we shall discuss below. ..Lack ofskill acquisition or learninr. It IDa): be that a 5pecWC twe ofsocial skill was never acquired or was inaAAguately learned, lmd therefore is never exhibited in any situation. In this case, the client does not bave the appropriate skill behaviors in his or her repertoire.

Here, the structure of the setting is a cue ecting the social behavior of the child.

Inthiscase,the sex oftheotherpersonappearstobeadiscriminativecue, such that same-sex partners elicit a skilled type of response, while opposite-sex partners elicit a much less effective social-skill response. Situational variables may affect reinforcement. As ific t of social s may m eren con uences, suc that in some situations it is rei 0 ,w e m er situations it is not reinforced. As we will ela rate moremorougbly in Chapter2, itislikely that social skills ofalmostanykindare learned and refined naturalistically as a result of their ability to lead to reinforcement. If a skill is reinforced consistently in some situations but not in others, an individual should learn to identify or discriminate those situations in which a particular interpersonal strategy is most functional or capable of leading to reinforcement. Thus, for exarnple, the assertive skills that one would use to effectively resolve a disagreement with his brother might be different than the skills the same person would exhibit when disagreeing with a hottempered supervisor at work. A college student\\'s interactions with her roommate will be quite different than her conversation on a job interview or with her college advisor, because somewhat different behaviors are likely to be reinforced in each of these situations:Jgeally, individuals learn what social skills .!ill be reinforced in different settings, and adapt their behavior accordingly. However, problems can arise ifa person either enters a situation and does not know what social skills will be reinforced or ifthe person\\'s social style is so inflexible that a skill is rigidly used even when it is not adaptive. For example, people may handle many situations in a passive manner, even when assertion is appropriate, because they have not been previously reinforced for exhibiting assertive behavior. Describing Socially Skilled Behavior in an Objective, Identifiable Manner In order to teach clients new social skills, it is necessary to objectively define those behaviors that make a given type of interaction skillful. Let us assume that we are watching a number of people while each is confronted with the unreasonable behavior of another person toward him or her. We might observe 10 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions and label as \"assertive\" the way one person handles an antagonist, and label as \"unassertive\" the way another handles the same situation. Labeling an interpersonal response as assertive or unassertive is a result of our observation of various behaviors included in the response; the behavioral components of refusal assertion might includethepresence ofsuch nonverbalcharacteristics as eye contact, firm affect, verbal fluency, appropriate loudness, gestures, and shortlatency ordelay between the conclusion ofthe antagonist\\'s comments-and the individual\\'s response. Verbal content components of an effectively assertive response could include a statement conveying recognition of the antagonist\\'s viewpoint but verbal noncompliance or disagreement with the other person; a request for specific antagonist behavior change; or the proposal of an acceptable solution to the conflict (cf. Eisler, Miller, & Hersen, 1973; Linehan, Goldfried, & Goldfried, 1979; Mullinix & Galassi, 1978; Woolfolk & Dever, 1979). Thus, the social ability termed \"refusal assertion\" can be broken down behaviorally into a constellation of identifiable behavioral components. Since these component behaviors can be specified and described in a relatively clear-cutandobjectivefashion, thesocial-skillstrainingtherapistcanassessthe extent to which each component is present in a client\\'s interactions and then train those components that are absent or deficient. Ifthe identified components are the salient determinants of an effective response, one can teach the skill by teaching the components comprising it. This behavioral mode of skill-analysis may be applied not only to refusal assertion, but to any form of social competency. One can observe how skillful individuals initiate or maintain conversations, handle job interviews, meet persons whomthey wishtodate, orcommendtheactions ofothers. Inthecase of children, it is possible to observe play and social-behavior differences between popular and unpopular children. In social-skills assessment and training, one seeks to determine those specific behavioral components that constitute the desired type of skill, and then to systematically teach the identified component behaviors to the skills-deficient client. Social Skill Functioning and Psychological Adjustment Traditional theories of rsonality and psychopathology have long reco nized ,,Eelationshjps between social fiJDktjoning and emotloniit adJustmentiJhese rela: tionships have been most thoroughly elaborated in the personality development descriptions of Harry Stack Sullivan, Alfred Adler, Karen Homey, and other neo-Freudian interpersonal theorists. Sullivan, for example, rejected the notion of an internal rsonali construct, arguing instead that what we term\"personality\" exists and can be defined on y 10 e context 0 1Oterpersonal rell!:. _tionships. To the extent that an individual successfully interacts With others,_ - Social Skills and Psychological Adjustment: Conceptual Foundations 11 that individual will receiv accumulating itive social feedback and c a IS r self in a positive fashion (Sullivan, 1953). On the other hand, when relationships With significant other people are characterized by anxiety, frustration of needs, or negative feedback, the individual\\'s self-appraisals will be correspondingly negative, distorted, and regressive. Such constructs as self-esteem or self-concept are thereby determined by the interpersonal relations and feedback that an individual receives during the course of development. Homey\\'s theoretical approach to personality also stresses interpersonal functioning in relation to adjustment. According to her formulation, the social insecurity of a child early in life produces an enduring disturbance in that person\\'s later social interactions, which takes the form of excessive and maladaptive \"movement toward people,\" including \"neurotic\" and lifelong needs for affection; \"movement away from people,\" characterized by social avoidanceorindependencetopreventbeing hurt; or\"movementagainst others\" (Homey, 1945). When an infant or child has experienced parental social inconsistency, overindulgence, hostility, or deprivation, later relationships then become recurrently maladaptive as the individual attempts to reduce the basic social anxiety that had been created earlier. In similar fashion, Adler\\'s description of personality stresses the relationship between detrimental early life experiences (including parental pampering, neglect, physical or emotional inferiorities, and absence of sibling contact) and corresponding later disturbance in social functioning (see Adler, 1931). These theories provide a descriptive linkage between early social relationships and personality.

Reinforcers are not absolutes, and goals that one person considers highly desirable may be quite unimportant to someone else. However, achievement of most of the goals sought by clients (and anyone else) does require reasonably successful 12 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions interaction with other people. The goal ofestablishing friendships requires that a client initiate and maintain certain types of informal conversational interactions; without those skills in his or her repertoire, it is unlikely that the client can develop satisfactory friendships. In order to establish dating relationships, a more specialized set of social-skill competencies are needed. To maintain feelings ofself-worth and to feel that one can communicate beliefs or opinions to others, assertive capabilities must be present in the individual\\'s skills repertoire. To achieve the goal of being offered a desirable job, a candidate must first convey socially to a potential employer that he or she will be a competent, achieving employee; in order to be promoted to a better job, requisite social skills include the ability to interact effectively with subordinates, peers, and supervisors across a variety of different work situations. To the extent that a client\\'s interpersonal repertoire permits the attainment of goals that the client deems reinforcing, that individual is likely to evaluate himself or herself in positive terms. Thus, favorable self-evaluation (including such global descriptors as \"self-esteem\" and \"self-confidence\") forms as a consequence of a social-skills repertoire that permits the attainment ofpersonally meaningful goals. In addition, as social skills are practiced and become reinforced within specific goal-oriented situations, it is likely that they will continue to be exhibited and that the skills repertoire of the client will become further elaborated. For example, the individual who has the skills to initiate interactions with others will not only be reinforced for those initiations, but will also develop close relationships conducive to the practice, refinement, and learning of additional social competencies. On the other hand, ifa client has failed to acquire the social-skills re rtoire necessary to attain personally sigm lcant go s 10 e environment, a much more detnmental pattern is probable. As a result of an mtltuu skills deficiency, a chem may be persistently unable to achieve sought-after goals, and attempts at social initiation may actually be punished. In this way, the child who lacks peer-valued play and social skills could be such an unrewarding agent that other children seek to minimize their contact with the skills-deficient child. An adolescent who is severely deficient in date-initiation skills may have his orher attempts to initiate dates repeatedly rejected. The formerly institutionalized psychiatric patient with severe social-skills deficits will find it extremely difficult to establish appropriate social relationships in the community, especially if he or she \"looks like\" a former psychiatric patient to most poopl~ outsideoftheinstitution. AnunemployedmotherwhohasbeenonWelfare,but who in fact is employable and seeks work, may be consistently rejected for employment because she lacks the social skills to portray herselfas vocationally competent under the stress and novelty of an interview. Under such repeated failure conditions, it is likely that clients will develop negative self-evaluations and begin to cognitively label themselves as\\'socially awkward, unsuccessful, undesirable, or unattractive. Thus, the initial skill Social Skills and Psychological Adjustment: Conceptual Foundations 13 deficits ofclients are antecedents for the failure to attain personally reinforcing goals, which in turn gives rise to persistent negative self-evaluation. As a result of unsuccessful social interactions, a client is also likely to develop failureoriented cognitions and anticipate anxiety when confronted with situations that he or she feels unprepared to handle effectively, based on past experience. Meichenbaum and his associates (Meichenbaum & Cameron, 1974) have described the manner in which such failure-oriented cognitions can foster social anxietyand, underthedisruptiveinfluence ofthisanxiety, resultinevenfurther impaired social-skill performance. A likely consequence of this pattern is that the client\\'s attempts to handle the troublesome situations will extinguish as a result of nonreinforcement, punishment, or the uncomfortable anxiety associated with attempts to attain goals when the requisite skills for doing so are insufficient. Avoidance of the situations, social isolation, or abandonment of the desired but unattainable goals are prediCtable outcomes. Unfortunately, this pattern of initial skill-deficiency may well perpetuate continued skills deficits in the future. By avoiding situations that require social competencies that he or she lacks, the individual is not likely to be in a position to learn more appropriate skills. The socially isolated child, by virture of reduced opportunities for peer interaction, will be less likely to observe and interact with skillful peer models and less likely to be reinforced by others when skillful prosocial behaviors do occur. The formerly institutionalized adult who lacks everyday conversational skills may be so avoided by other people that there will be continued isolation and few opportunities to learn more effective social skills in the natural environment, thereby perpetuating continued skilldeficiency. By intervening to teach clients more appropriate social skills, it is possible to interrupt this cycle. The aim of social-skills training is to directly increase th~ behavioral competency of individuals so that they can achieve successful outcomes in those types of social situations where their current skills are inadequate. Thus,JIle target for intervention is the individual\\'s current social .behavior itself. rather than postulated early-life contributors to the observed deficits. As a client learns and practices new social skills in the therapy or , training environment, and then exhibits them in previously troublesome situations in the natural environment, more satisfactory outcomes in those situations should be achieved and the client\\'s self-evaluation and self-perception of competence wilt correspondingly become more positive. Skills-Training and Client Growth Some observers have suggested that most traditional psychotherapies seem principally oriented toward the \"removal\" of sources ofpsychological discomfort (Hollandsworth, personal communication, 1979). Clinicians and counselors have directed a great deal of attention to techniques that reduce client 14 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions anxiety, reduce client depression, and reduce client conflict. If troublesome behaviors and characteristics could only be eliminated from a client\\'s functioning, that individual would then be able to cope and adapt more successfully. Thus traditional treatment often a more oriented to removing undesirable charactens ICS an to systematicall stren thening esirable response cap Illes. n contrast to this essentially pessimistic \"discomfort uction\" mOdel, socuif-skills training approaches seek to build new behavioral competencies in clients. In this manner, skills-training adds to the adaptive and social repertoire of the client, rather than simply reducing discomfort. Behavioral treatment approaches have been criticized b some clinicians on Jhe grounds that they are i erently mechanistic, controlling, coercive, or that ~ e fail to reco\\' he tential for\" rsonality growth\" (Bre er & McGaugh, 1965; Portes, 1971; Rogers & Skinner, 195 ; Shoben, 1%3). However, behavioral social-skills training explicitly recognizes and uires the abi ItY 0 C len soc an e as a result of their learning experiences, rhaps more an 10 almost any other treatment a proach. Social-skills training assumes t reg ess 0 w y a c lent has not learn ow to handle certain interpersonal interactions successfully, that client can be taught more effective behavioral competencies ifthe desired competencies are identified clearly and iflearning principles are systematically applied to increase them. Since training requires that the client actively practice and rehearse new responses to troublesome situations, the client becomes actively and directly involved in treatment, rather than being a passive recipient of the therapist\\'s advice or interpretation. As we will see, the learning theory principles that are employed in social-skills training are the same as those learning theory principles that presumably operate to facilitate social-skills learning in the natural environment. Thus, kills-trainin intensifies or com resses naturall -occurring learning ex riences within treatment ssions and utilizes the tenti 0 benefit from e mtensive learning exposure. There is also an ex licit 0 timism that once c lents ave a new skills to their inte rsonal re rtoire in the Jiii ng seRmg, filer can then learn to generalize or extend the exhibition of.these skills to previously troublesome social interactions in the natural environiiient. eqUipped wim new competencies, the individual should experience ~more successful outcomes in the situations targeted for treatment. Naturally-occurring reinforcement contingencies (including more positive reactions from others in interpersonal situations, the formation of relationships with others, feelings ofpersonalsatisfactiondue to more effectiveexpression ofbeliefs, and more satisfactory attainment of goals) can then maintain improved social skills beyond the initial training environment. Once more appropriate skills are exhibited and reinforced in the environment, the client\\'s increased confidence will allow him to be exposed to still other social interactions, accompanied by enhanced opportunities for the natural learning of additional competencies. Chapter 2 The Social-Learning Theory Model of Skills-Acquisition Ifwe conceptualize social skills as learned strategies that serve purposeful or goal-directed functions, it becomes appropriate to determine how they are nonnally acquired during development. If the factors responsible for the naturalistic learning of social competencies can be specified, it should then be possible to incorporate similar principles in training interventions for clients who have not yet acquired those skills. Social-learning theory has provided the foundation for viewing social competencies as learned behaviors. This theory postulates that the development of behavior, including the interpersonal style of an individual, can be accurately described, explained, and predicted based on learning theory principles. If one can determine the specific learning history of an individual, it will be possible to account for the manner in which that person handles situations, such as those situations requiring socially skilled responses. Social-learning theOry, as applied to skills development, has the principles of instrumental or operant ~naltiOnmg as its basiS. \\'I\\'he operant approach emPhasizes the Importance of environmental antecedents and consequences in the development and maintenance of behavior. However, such theoreticians as Bandura, Rotter, Mischel, and Meichenbaum have elaborated learning principles to include the effects of vicarious (modeled) sources oflearnin co nitive expectancies and subjective rei orcement value situational s ificity of behavior, and the role of cognitive behaviors (such as self-statements an self-mstructlons):.Social- Learning Mechanisms and the Naturalistic Development of Sodal Competencies Social skills are acquired naturalistically as a consequence of several basic learning mechanisms. These mechanisms include: direct positive reinforcement of the skills; vicarious or observational learning experiences; receiving 15 16 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions interpersonal feedback; and the development of cognitive expectancies concerning interpersonal situations. Let us review each of these mechanisms. Skills-Learning as a Result of Direct Reinforcement Even during very early infancy, it is apparent that rudimentary social behaviors can be developed and maintained by their reinforcing consequences. Infants appear to learn very quickly those behaviors capable of eliciting positive consequences from the environment, including: crying to bring food, attention, or relief from discomfort; smiling and cooing to bring social attention and stimulation from others; and the exhibition of motor skills, which lead to physical and attentional responses from other people (Engen, Lipsett, & Kaye, 1963). Over time, the interpersonal repertoire of behaviors exhibited by the child becomes much more elaborated, diverse, and verbal, just as the variety of events that assume positively reinforcing properties becomes increasingly diverse, social, and removed from primary (body-need) functions. To the extent that various types ofsocial interactions lead to positive consequences for a child and later for an adult, it is likely they will be reinforced and included in that person\\'s interpersonal repertoire. The manner in which direct personal reinforcement history operates to shape thenaturalistic development ofsocial skills appears tobe governed bya number of factors. One of these is the subjective value of the events that can serve as reinforcers. Reinforcement is not an absolute property, and reinforcers are defmed in terms of their functional ability to increase the likelihood of the behaviors that they follow. The extent to which such social outcomes as play with peers, conversations with others, dates, or positive comments from other people serve as functional reinforcers varies across individuals. Ifsuch events do not function as salient reinforcers for a given individual, it is likely that the social skills that lead to those outcomes will be less developed. Rotter, for example, notes that predicting the likelihood for a given behavior to occur must take into account the subjective reinforcement value of the consequating event to the individual (Rotter, 1954). Interestingly, autistic and some severely retarded children appear highly unresponsive to the interpersonal attention that most children fmd reinforcing, and remain oriented toward primary (biological-need) rather than secondary (social) forms of reinforcement. This may partially account for the impaired social-skills development of these persons, since many interpersonal consequences of skill-exhibition do not seem to be salient reinforcers for them. Even in less extreme cases, the potency or subjective value of reinforcement availablethrough use ofvarioustypes ofsocial skillsaffects the skills\\' development. A second mechanism influencing the direct learning of skills involves the specificity of circumstances under which they are reinforced. Mischel (1973) The Social-Learning Theory Model of Skills-Acquisition 17 has pointed out that very few social behaviors are reinforced consistently across all situations or settings. and we observed earlier that social skills differ both functionally and qualitatively depending upon the nature of an interpersonal setting. Similarly. whether or not a given type of skill will be exhibited across differing situations can be determined by the individual\\'s reinforcement history for behavior in those situations. This becomes particularly important when people approach novel situations in which they have had no direct learning experience. If an individual approaches a novel interpersonal situation that is perceived and cognitively labeled as similar to other past situations in which a certain type of social response was effective (or which provides cues similar to those present in past learning), the individual is likely to behave in a manner consistent with behavior that worked in the past (Mischel, 1973). To the extent that the skill behavior will also be effective in the new situation, this form of response-generalization will prove adaptive. On the other hand, novel social situationscan be problematic ifdifferent social skillsare needed to handle them and if the person has little reinforcement history for engaging in those skills. as well as if the new situation was incorrectly perceived and different response contingencies are, in fact. operating. Finally, basic research on reinforcement scheduling has demonstrated that new behaviors are most efficiently established under conditions in which they are reinforced on a consistent basis, with each instance of the desired, correct behavior being reinforced whenever it occurs (Reynolds, 1958). Unfortunately, most social skills are not reinforced on such a consistent basis when they are fltSt being acquired. An individual\\'s early attempts to express assertion, to ask someone for a date, to interview for a job, or to meet new people following discharge from an institution may not be reinforced with consistently positive responses from others. This is especially likely when the person has not yet fully mastered the skill and is relatively less able to engage in it effectively. Ifa ...!Qcial behavior is repeatedly attempted but does not lead to some positive ~uence, especii11y during the earlier stages of learning, it may well ~xtinguish ana cease to be eXhibited. Skills-Learning as a Result of Observational Experiences We learn how to handle interpersonal situations as a result of our direct experience in those situations and, more specifically, as a result of reinforcement histories for handling them in certain ways. Another potent source ~f skills-learning is observing how other people handle situations. Bandura (1969) has described the influence of observational or vicarious learning (termed \"modeling\") on social behavior. and demonstrated its effect in a large number of studies._Exposure to a model can have any of three types of effects: (1) the modeling effect, in which the observer of the model acquires a 18 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions new behavior that he or she did not exhibit viousl as a cons ence of the ,observation 0 m I; () e sinhibitory effect, in which exposure to the model causes the observer to more fr uend exhibit a behavior that had bee sent earlier; the inhibitory effect, in which the observer e .. behavior less frequendy r exposure to a model than before exposure to it (Bandura & Walters, 1963). With respect to social skills-development, the modeling and disinhibitory effects appear most important. Children, adolescents, and adults develop new competencies to handle situations by observing how live models around them, including parents, siblings, friends, co-workers, and supervisors, handle those situations. Thus, social-skill knowledge can be acquired initially without personal learning experience in the relevant situations. For young children, parents and older siblings are among the most potent sources for imitative social learning; in time, other models in the environment become important sources of observationallearning and supersede the influence of family models. This appears particularly true in adolescence, when peers become extremely influential sources for modeling social-skill behaviors (Lasseigne, 1975). A number of studies have investigated the circumstances under which modeled learning is most likely to occur and when the observer is most likely to actually exhibit a new behavior seen in a model (cf. Bandura & Huston, 1961; Bandura & Kupers, 1964; Bandura, Ross, & Ross, 1963). Some ofthe factors that appear to facilitate observational learning include: 1. Age ofthe model. particularly in childhood and adolescence. Children are most likely to imitate the behavior of a model similar in age to the observer or slightly older. Social behaviors exhibited by younger models are less likely to be imitated. 2. Sex ofthe model, with models ofthe same sex as the observerexerting a stronger influence than opposite-sex models. 3. Likeability ofthe model. with models high in warmth and affectionate characteristics more salient in influence than cold, unaffectionate-appearing models. 4. Perceived similarity to the observer. Ifanobserverperceives oristold that a model is similar to himself or herself, a greater degree of imitative learning will occur than if the model is seen as highly dissimilar. 5. Observed consequence to the model when the model engages in the social behavior. If the observer watches a model engage in a social behavior and also sees that the model achieves a positive outcome as a result ofit, thereis increasedlikelihoodthatthe observerwill imitatethatbehavior. This is termed \"vicarious reinforcement,\" since the observer sees the reinforcing consequence achieved by another person. On the other hand, The Social-Learning Theory Model of Skills-Acquisition 19 observed (vicarious) punishment of a model\\'s social behavior decreases the likelihood of imitative behavior. 6. The observer\\'s own direct learning historyfor engaging in the same or similar social behavior as seen in the model. In many cases, the observer has had some direct, personal experience handling situations similar to those in which the model is seen. The observer may have engaged in similar social responses as well. If the observer has a personal history of being rewarded for behaviors similar to those now exhibited by the model, it is more likely thattheobserverwill actuallyexhibitthemodeledsocialbehaviorthan ifthe observer has been personally punished for behaviors now seen in the model. Inthisway, theobserver\\'sexpectanciesconcerningwhatwouldhappen ifhe or she actually engaged in the modeled behavior influence the likelihood of performing that skill. While live models are a source of much observational learning, other forms of modeling also account for social-skill acquisition during development. These include portrayed realistic models, such as television or filmed portrayals of others; portrayed nonrealistic models, including cartoons, or animated nonhuman models; and symbolic models, such as idealized, elaborate verbal descriptions of the conduct of another person (a good Christian, the perfect Eagle Scout, or the ideal employee of a company). A good deal of clinical and research attention has been directed toward studying the manner in which naturalistic modeling can exert a detrimental effect on behavior. This has been particularly emphasized with respect to the effects of portrayed, televised violence and sexual misconduct, as well as the effects of live peer-modeling of antisocial or delinquent behavior during early adolescence (Bandura, 1965; Bandura, Ross, & Ross, 1963; Rosekrans & Hartup, 1967). However, it seems likely that for most people, adaptive and prosocial skills are more often learned observationally than are antisocial behaviors. In early childhood, the ways in which parents and older siblings handle social situations can be observed and copied, rather directly, by the young child. During school years, children appear to imitate the social behavior and play-skills exhibited by other children, particularly those classmates and friends who exhibit the characteristics that are associated with increased likelihood of imitative learning (e.g., same sex, same age or slightly older, warm, and successful when exhibiting the behaviors). Adolescents and adults also learn how to handle many social situations by imitating the behavior of others; initiating friendships and dates, learning how to handle job interviews or college-admission interviews, disagreeing with others, and expressing oneself assertively are skills acquired, in part, by directly watching other people in those situations or receiving detailed verbal modeling instructions from them. 20 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions Especially when approaching novel situations, people often visualize, recall, and imitate the social skills that have been seen in others and used successfully by them. If modeled learning is an important mechanism for the naturalistic development of social competencies, one might specify some conditions under which it might fail to occur. Ifa child lacks appropriate live models due to isolation from parents, older siblings, or peers, there would be correspondingly less opportunity to observe bow they handle interpersonal situations. Several studies provide indirect support for this pattern. Miller and Maruyama (1976) and Shrader and Leventhal (1968) have reported that \"only\" children or children who are the oldest in their families (and therefore lack older-sibling models) exhibit more frequent peer difficulties and behavior problems, at least through later childhood. This effect appears to dissipate over time, presumably as the role of farnily models becomes less crucial and the presence of peer models outside the family increases during school and later years (Birtchnell, 1972). At the same time, prolonged peer isolation in childhood bas been associated with a variety of more frequent coping and social-interactive problems in adult life (Elkins, 1958; O\\'Neal & Robins, 1958; Stennett, 1966). Individuals who have fewer opportunities to interact with socially skilled peers will also have less opportunity to watch and observationally learn from them. A child with few friends will be more isolated from peers during free play at school, during after-school activities, and at other times. In addition to diminishing the probability that the child will be directly reinforced for appropriate interaction skills, the simple physical isolation from others also decreases exposure to more skilled models. The same patterns can exist well beyond childhood. The shy adolescent or adult who has always shunned social activities in favor of solitary and nonsocial pursuits will have correspondingly less exposure totheconductofskilled models; whenthis individualapproaches new interpersonal situations, the strategies for handling them may not be based on the observed behavior of others, but only on a trial-and-error system from limited personal and direct social-learning experience. The absence of appropriate skill models is extremely evident in the environment of institutionalized persons, such as retarded or emotionally disturbed children and adults. Within a confined institutional setting, there may be very few peer models who exhibit those social skills that are adaptive in the noninstitutional environment; in fact, social behaviors that are modeled in residential facilities for chronically low-functioning persons may be quite unadaptive outside that setting. Most therapists who work in long-term residential facilities such as retardation centers and psychiatric hospitals are well aware of the low level of social-interaction quality within them. From a sociallearning perspective, the relative absence of skillful models significantly im-pairs opportunities for those clients to observationally learn more adaptive The Social-Learning Theory Model of Skills-Acquisition 21 competencies and also reduces the likelihood that appropriate skills, if exhibited, will be actively reinforced by other clients in that setting. The potential for modeling-induced social-skills learning to occur is also diminished in those kinds of interpersonal situations in which people rarely have the opportunity to observe others. The social skills needed to effectively convey to one\\'s boss the \"case\" for a raise or promotion may be unclear if one has never observed this situation well-handled by someone else. Effective job-interview behavior can be especially troublesome to the inexperienced applicant, who has had little personal experience in that specialized situation and who has not observed successful models exhibit job-interview skills. Disharmonious couples, especially those who are isolated from very close couple friends, are unlikely to observe the effective conflict-resolution skills exhibited by others; this occurs primarily because a couple\\'s adaptive conflictresolution strategies rarely occur under circumstances in which others can observe them. Thus, all people acquire social competencies not only as a result of personal learning experience and their direct-reinforcement history, but also by observing the modeled behavior ofothers. Under circumstances where opportunities for modeled learning are reduced, the development of those skill competencies may be correspondingly weaker. Skills-Learning and Interpersonal Feedback As individuals gain practice in handling a certain type of social situation and develop adaptive skills that bring about favorable outcomes, their behavior becomes more refined and well-honed. The initial attempts of a previously unassertive person to behave in an appropriately assertive fashion may be somewhat awkward, stilted, and uncomfortable, but will become progressively more refined under favorable, reinforcing conditions. The early date-initiation behavior of a young adolescent is usually less effective than that adolescent\\'s dating skills two years later. Adults often feel less at ease and behave less skillfully when ftrst meeting a new person in conversation, but more at ease during subsequent interactions. If social behavior in a given situation is reinforced through some positive outcome, it will not only tend to recur, but will change and become more effective over time. An importagt mechanism contributing to the refinement and sharpening of skills is feedback. In..social contexts, feedback is the information one receives from another person that communicates his or her response or reaction to one\\'s behavior. If someone is conversing with an acquaintance about interests and hobbies, that person may notice that the conversational partner becomes much more attentive when certain topics are discussed, such as tennis and sports, and much less attentive when other topics are mentioned, such as family problems. Consequently, the person adapts his or her social behavior in response to the Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions feedback provided by the other individual. Feedback can be positive in nature, strengthening certain aspects of social skills. Examples of such positive feedback might include another person\\'s increase in eye contact, posture movement toward the individual who is speaking, or verbal comments conveying explicit interest in what is being said. Feedback may also be negative, thereby weakening aspects of the particular behavior. Negative feedback could include such responses as reduced eye contact, yawning, or movement away from the speaker. In a sense, what we term \"feedback\" can be actually viewed as social reinforcement (or the lack of it) administered contingently by the other person in the interaction. Some researchers have suggested that feedback, by definition, is only a molecular or \"process\" form of reinforcement over the course of social interactions (Madsen, Becker, & Thomas, 1968). A number of studies have demonstrated that contingent feedback can alter the social behavior of clients, even without their awareness of it (see Greenspoon, 1955). Ideally, however, feedback should be direct and convey relatively specific information for the person to whom it is directed. To exert its maximum impact, feedback will be associated with a specific aspect of behavior and will be communicated clearly and verbally to the individual. With the information provided through feedback, the person receiving it will be better able to change and enhance his or her impact on others. In some cases, clear feedback is provided during the course of an everyday interaction. Examples of this might include being told: \"It made you look honest when you looked me right in the eye\"; \"I didn\\'t believe that you were really being firm because you were smiling\"; \"You talk too much about your problems\"; or \"You make me feel comfortable because you get me to talk about myself.\" In these examples, the person receiving the comments is in a position to either maintain or eliminate certain social-skill behaviors, since the informational nature of the feedback is clear-cut. In many routine interactions, social feedback is more ambiguous or essentially absent. If an adolescent attempts to initiate dating behavior and is repeatedly rejected, he usually does not receive very specific feedback as to why he is turned down by the prospective dates. What aspects of his style were deficient? Were there verbal or nonverbal elements of his date-initiation behavior that led to repeated rejection? If so, what were the deficient or inappropriate aspects? Without such information, the individual is not likely to know how he is being perceived and will not be in a position to change these behaviors. Similarly, an individual may feel that he is making an appropriately assertive response t<;l some troublesome behavior from another person. However, others may be quite perturbed by his behavior and consider it highly aggressive, rather than appropriately assertive. They are, perhaps, identifying certain aspects of the response (hostile tone, antagonistic comments, no verbally conveyed reThe Social-Learning Theory Model of Skills-Acquisition 23 cognition of their position) that make the response noxious and ineffective. Unless the individual receives specific feedback from others on those aspects, they may be quite difficult to change. Unfortunately, with the exception of occasional feedback provided by close friends at the request of an individual, most everyday interactions provide little opportunity to receive this kind of clear-cut information. It must often be inferred, without great precision, from the more global and general reactions of others; as feedback becomes less precise and less tied to identifiable behavior, it also loses its ability to help people refine their own social skills. Skills-Learning and Cognitive Expectancies Julian Rotter introduced the notion that the subjective value ofa given reinforcer must be taken into account in order to accurately predict whether an individual will engage in a behavior leading to that reinforcer (Rotter, 1954). Thus, as we noted earlier, social skills will assume greater importance and meaning if they lead to outcomes that a client values highly. Another predictor of social behavior, first noted by Rotter, is the individual\\'s cognitive expectancy for success in a given situation. o nitive expectancies are beliefs 0 in the received probability of successfully handling some situation. A;fording to 0 er, -expectanCies develop as a result of experience in a situation or in other situations similar to it. If a person has learned through direct experience, modeling, or feedback that he or she is able to handle a social interaction effectively, a positive cognitive expectancy for future success will develop. Assuming that the interaction is also enjoyable, rewarding, or significant (and therefore has relatively high reinforcement value), the individual is likely to approach that situation. On the other hand, the probability is low that one will enter into situations requiring skills that one feels unequipped to exhibit satisfactorily, even ifthe potentialoutcome mightbequitedesirable; suchskills carry a low cognitive expectancy for success. In short, Rotter\\'s formulation can be interpreted to suggest that individuals will enter into situations requiring socially skilled behavior if both (I) the potential outcome from using those skills is sufficiently reinforcing and (2) the individual has developed, based on experience, the cognitive expectancy that he or she will be able to exhibit the skills needed to handle the situation effectively. What are the mechanisms that comprise cognitive expectancies for success or failure in handling a given situation? In the previous chapter, we noted that the way in which clients label situations and what they actually tell themselves about their performance can influence skills-development and -exhibition. More specifically, if a person has a history of success in handling some type of interaction (such as those requiring general conversations with others, assertive 24 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions expression, job-interview skills, date-initiation, or commendatory skills), the person is likely to label those situations as enjoyable, stimulating, orchallenging, and to label his or her own behavior as competent, successful, or effective. Conversely, negative expectancies are probably acquired as a result of past difficulties in handling the troublesome situation and are maintained by cognitions of failure concerning performance in that situation. Two related approaches seem useful for reducing negative expectancies and the related anxiety that maintains them. One is to directly alter the detrimental manner in which clients label and covertly talk to themselves when they are anticipating the troublesome interaction (see Meichenbaum & Cameron, 1974). However, unless a skills-deficient client does actually acquire more adaptive ways to handle the social situation and achieve greater success in it, the success of cognitive modification alone appears unlikely. Thus, a second approach is to directly increase the behavioral skills-eompetency of the client to successfully handle those interactions that have proven troublesome. Social-Leaming Principles: The Active Ingredients of Skills-Training Interventions The learning of social competencies in the natural environment is determined by such factors as history ofdirect reinforcement for skilled behavior, imitative or observational learning history, feedback and the shaping or refinement of skills, ample opportunities to practice newly acquired behaviors, and the development of increasingly positive cognitions or expectancies for performance. Regardless of why certain competencies were not acquired naturally in socially deficient clients, the same learning principles can be used to teach those skills in our treatment interventions. The treatment principles that appear crucial to an ofclinical social-skills inin intervention are: mstfuCtton- and rationale provided to the client, modeling eXPQsure, opportunity for actu ctice of the skill, reinforcement and back on the client\\'s behavioral .1JlCtice, an gene ization of skill-improvement to the natural environment. Let us consider first how these general social-learning treatment principles can be applied to skills-training and then we will examine several interventions that have actually used them. In Chapter 4, implementation of the principles will be considered in more detail and applied to specific types of skills-training interventions. Instruction and Rationale Provided to Client At the beginning of any social-skills training session, it is important to clearly convey to the client the exact skill-behavior or component that will receive attention that day and to provide a rationale for its importance. For example, an The Social-Learning Theory Model of Skills-Acquisition 25 assertive-training intervention may be intended to increase several verbal and several nonverbal components ofassertion, such as eye contact, voice tone and loudness, affect, verbal noncompliance, and statement of position. Ifincreasingclienteyecontactis the aim ofa particularsession, the therapistmightbegin that session by verbally telling the client how eye contact is defined, why it is importanttoexhibiteyecontactduringinteractions,andsoon. Forcomplicated verbal behaviors, clear identification of the component skills for the client is even more important, and examples may be given to illustrate the verbal behavior that will receive training attention that day. The purpose ofbeginning each session with brief instruction and explanation of the component by the therapist is to ensure that clients understand that day\\'s expectations for their performance. Modeling Exposure Client exposure to a model who correctly exhibits the skill-component being targeted for training in the session permits the observational learning of that component. While verbally presented instructions or examples of a skillbehavior given by the therapist may provide an initial purpose for that day\\'s session, a client\\'s own observation of how a model actually exhibits the skill-component often conveys more clearly the nature ofthe desired behavior. Models during training sessions can be live or portrayed. An example oflive modeling might be two therapists interacting during a role-play with one another. One of the therapists serves as a model for the client to observe, and the therapist model exhibits the skill being targeted in that day\\'s session. In assertiveness-training, for example, one therapist might play an antagonist with whom a second (model) therapist interacts. If verbal noncompliance and the statement of one\\'s own position are the behavioral components of assertion to be trained in a particular session, the model exhibits these components in his or her response to the antagonist..If the purpose of the intervention is to teach a clientconversational skills, and ifthe skill-component selected for trainingthat day is getting one\\'s conversational partner to talk about himself or herself. the two models might engage in a brief conversation with one another. In this modeled conversation, verbal behaviors, such as asking appropriate questions to elicit information from one another, could be illustrated. The important function here is that the live models exhibit, correctly and clearly, the desired skill-component for the client to observe. Modeling exposure can also be accomplished using portrayed models, such as videotapes, which show the models exhibiting socially skilled behavior. In assertion-training, a video fUm might demonstrate a model handling the unreasonable behavior of another person and exhibiting all components of assertion. Conversational-skills-modeling fUms could show two people engaged in effective conversation, again exhibiting the behavioral components that will 26 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions eventually be trained to the client. In job-interview or date-initiation training interventions, the film could show a model successfully handling those respective situations. The advantage of exposing clients to a videotaped model exhibiting the relevant skill, rather than exposing them to a live therapist model, is that the filmed model\\'s behavior can be controlled and predetermined to ensure that the skill components are correctly, consistently shown. It also permits the therapist to observe the filmed model along with the clients and to point out important aspects of the model\\'s behavior to them as they occur. This could not be as easily done if the therapist were simultaneously modeling the skill. Overt Practice or Behavior Rehearsal After a client is instructed on what component behaviors comprise an effective skill and he or she observes them in a model, it is then important to have the client actually practice that skill. Overt practice or rehearsal in handling a troublesome interaction adds the skill-components into the client\\'s behavioral repertoire, beyond the simple understanding of what he or she should do differently. In all cases, practice or rehearsal within sessions is intended to approximate, as closely as possible, the actual troublesome situation of the natural environment. Rehearsal assumes that when a client is able to handle an interaction more effectively in training, and when new skills have been added to the previously deficient repertoire, the client will then be in a position to exhibit those skills outside of treatment.Overt practice or behavior-rehearsal within trainin sessions is one of the factors that most dramatically sets SOCl -Skills training apart from traditional interpersonally orien orms 0 -:psychothera&:. PrOCedures for client behavior-rehearsal depend upon the type of skill being trained, the specific kinds ofsituations that a client reports as troublesome, and thenature oftheintervention(suchas whethertrainingisbeingconductedwith a single client or a group of clients). Four forms of rehearsal or practice that have been widely used in social-skills training are structured role-plays, semistructured extended interactions, unstructured social interactions, and informal rehearsal verbalization of examples of the skill-component withintraining sessions. Role-plays. Assertive-training role-plays consist of a narrated description of some situation the client has found difficult to handle in the past. Another person, perhaps a therapist, plays the part of an antagonist in that situation and behaves unreasonably toward the client. The client then practices making assertive responses to the antagonist, focusing on the correct use of the component behavior receiving attention in that training session. Several difThe Social-Learning Theory Model of Skills-Acquisition 27 ferent troublesome situations are usually role-played in the same session, since the aim of training is to teach the client to handle a variety of situations more successfully. Role-play fonns ofrehearsal during sessions are most suitable when the aim of training is to teach clients to handle the relatively specific comments or behavior of another person. Role-played rehearsal techniques have been used extensively to allow clients to practice refusal-assertion skills when confronted with the unreasonable behavior of others (Butler, 1976; Ochiltree, 1977), commendatory skills to reciprocate the positive behavior of another person (Sloat, Tharp, & Gallimore, 1977), and effective job-interview skills when presented with questions that are frequently asked by personnel managers during employment interviews (Hollandsworth, Dressel, & Stevens, 1977). Semistructured practice. In other cases, the type of social interaction that is being targeted for training is of longer duration and is difficult to present in highly structured fonn with the behavior of the partner relatively fixed. An example ofthis is a conversation, which seems more difficult to structure into a role-play than to engage in naturally. Date initiation and heterosocial skillstraining have also relied upon semistructured practice interactions. For example, in a date-training project, Melnick (1973) allowed a male client to interact for several minutes with a female confederate. During these interactions, the confederate always maintained certain general constraints on her behavior (such as not monopolizing the conversation, requiring the client to maintain the conversational initiative, remaining consistently warm, etc.), but she did not deliver predetermined role-play comments or statements to the client. Clients wereinstructed touse thedate-initiationcomponentbehaviors thatthey hadjust been taught during the course of their practice interaction with the female. Thus, the practice or rehearsal was semistructured and approximated a dateinitiation situation that might occur outside of training. In similar fashion, Kelly, Urey, and Patterson (1980) utilized semistructured conversations between psychiatric aftercare clients and confederates who served as interaction partners to teach components of conversational skill. Unstructured practice interaction. A fonn of rehearsal further removed from highly structured role plays is the unstructured practice social interaction. Here the nature of the rehearsal interaction and the behavior of the practice partner are quite unstructured and natural. In a study on social-skills training with isolated children, O\\'Connor (1969) placed each child in a free-play setting with other children immediately after training sessions and instructed the treated child to be sure to use the prosocial-play skills that had just been taught. The free-play interactions themselves were unstructured and the other children in them were simply playing naturally, rather than role-playing. Similarly, a 28 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions project intended to teach everyday conversational skills to a group of retarded adolescents utilized unstructured practice interaction for behavior rehearsal purposes (Kelly, Wildman, Urey, & Thurman, 1979). Here, two group members were placed in a room together following each training group, and were asked to get to know one another better for about 8 minutes; they were instructed to exhibit the conversational skill they had just discussed in the group-training session. Again, they were not role-playing a conversational interaction, but instead were actually having a conversation. Injo171\\'l(J1 rehearsal verbalization. Finally, it is possible to utilize the principle of behavior-rehearsal somewhat more informally in training sessions by asking the client to practice verbalizing examples of the verbal social-skill component. For example, when clients in a job-interview skills-training group were being taught how to convey information about their past work experience, each client actually practiced saying aloud these statements about experience that he or she would later want to say to a real interviewer (Kelly, Wildman, & Berler, 1980). Regardless of the practice procedure followed, overt rehearsal in handling difficult situations is a key element of social-skills training. It generates not only a sample of the client\\'s actual ability to exhibit a type of social skill, but also provides the client with the opportunity to actually practice new competencies, rather than merely talk abstractly to a therapist about them, or think about them. In addition, when a client is asked to practice or rehearse using a social skill, the therapist is in a position to directly assess the behavioral adequacy of the client\\'s practice and determine whether the client has behaviorally acquired new skill-components. Reinforcement and Feedback to Shape Behavioral Practice While behavior rehearsal of social skills is a necessary aspect of training, it alone is not sufficient to improve performance. Even with ample opportunity to practice new social competencies during training, it is possible for clients to repeatedly perform them incorrectly. Further, even if clients do exhibit improved performance during their rehearsal handling of troublesome situations, they may be unaware of how they improved unless they also receive specific feedback and reinforcement during training sessions. There are a number oftechniques for providing both feedback and reinforcement following cHent behavior rehearsal. Therapist-administered verbalfeedback on the client\\'s performance is one of the most basic techniques. Ifa client rehearses responses to an interviewer\\'s questions during a job-interview training role-play, the therapist might offer The Social-Learning Theory Model of Skills-Acquisition 29 feedback on the quality of the client\\'s role-played responses. Feedback would be tailored to the specific component-behavior that received training attention in that session and not to aspects of the client\\'s performance that had not yet ~ived treatment attention. As we have noted, to be maximally effective, any form of feedback should be direct, clear, and \"tied\" to a specific aspect of the client\\'s behavior. Comments such as \"I think you could do a little better\" do not represent effective feedback because the behavior to which they refer is unclear. Better examples might include: \"You maintained a lot of eye contact, much more than last time. It made you more believable\"; \"You spoke much more about your previous work experience when the interviewer asked about it; that\\'s terrific\"; or \"You spoke loud enough to be heard well, just as we\\'d been working on.\" These examples not only reflect clear, behaviorally referented feedback, but they also constitute verbal reinforcement of the desired skillcomponent. The client is explicitly told that he or she performed well, and is also told why the performance improved. Verbal praise and specific feedback serve to strengthen and maintain appropriate skill-exhibition in behavior-rehearsal; they also function to correct client misapplications of skill-components during practice. An example of this might be when a client is practicing increased eye contact, but is then observed to continually stare at the practice partner. In other cases, an unassertive client may overdo verbal noncompliance toward an antagonist and appear hostile rather than appropriately assertive. Instructional feedback provided by the therapist can suggest behavioral alternatives and shape or refine the client\\'s rehearsal performance. In some instances, clients may immediately learn new component-skills and exhibit them successfully during their first practice interactions. However, this is often not the case. The purpose of rehearsal is not to yield one tentative performance of the targeted skill-component, but instead to firmly establish a new behavior in the client\\'s repertoire. Thus, if an initial rehearsal is unsuccessful or if feedback suggests the need for additional refinement of the component-behavior receiving attention, further opportunities for the client to practice the behavior are indicated Client-administered verbal feedback. In group skills-training interventions, feedback and reinforcement on behavior rehearsal can come from both the therapists and from other group members. Client-administered verbal feedback following another client\\'s rehearsal serves the same function as therapist-administered feedback and may even have increased credibility for some individuals, since the feedback and reinforcement are from peers. Self-observation represents a third type of feedback technique that may be used, when equipment for videotaping and replaying client behavior rehearsal 30 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions is available. Here, the client and therapist together observe a film of the behavior rehearsal that just occurred. Feedback and verbal praise for correct instances of the skill component-behavior targeted for training in that session can be pointed out by both the therapist and the client when they are watching the film. In summary, the learning-theory principles of instruction, modeling, overt practice, feedback, and reinforcement can be incorporated within social-skills training sessions. Implied in this training approach is the notion that these principles can be used to successively shape the various component behaviors that comprise a socially skilled response. While the verbal and nonverbal component behaviors receiving attention at a given time change over the course of the intervention, the actual conduct of any single training session remains relatively constant and incorporates each of these learning principles. By the conclusion of a skills-training intervention, clients should have mastered each of the social-skill component-behaviors that had been targeted for training. Ifthe components taught to clients are, in fact, those behaviors that comprise an effective overall social skill, the client will then be exhibiting socially skilled responses during rehearsal or practice periods within the session. Once clients have learned more effective ways of handling troublesome situations and demonstrate those newly acquired skills within the treatment setting, it is then necessary that they exhibit the same new skills when actually confronted with the troublesome situations in the natural environment. Generalization of Skill-Improvement to the Natural Environment In spite of the emphasis on rehearsal and practice, the ultimate purpose of social-skills training is not to assist clients in more effectively handling the behavior of another person during practice interactions within training sessions. Instead, the skills-training therapist seeks to establish change during these controlled practice approximations ofthe troublesome situation and then, most importantly, to facilitate generalization of the client\\'s enhanced skills back to the problematic situations that occur in the natural environment. If clients exhibit appropriate social skills during rehearsal in the training setting, but then fail to do so in the natural environment, the intervention has served no clinical function. \"Generalization of training effects\" refers to the presence ofa newly learned response or skill under conditions different than those surrounding the initial learning of the skill. There are several types of generalization relevant to the skills-training therapist. These include generalization across time, across physical setting or environment, and across interpersonal situations. The Social-Learning Theory Model of Skills-Acquisition 31 Generalization across time refers to the maintenance of a skill in the individual\\'srepertoireforaperiod oftimeafterithasbeenoriginallylearned. If a job-interview skill-training intervention effectively improves a client\\'s ability to handle interviewer questions during role-play practice sessions, that improvement must then be maintained throughout the period that the client is job-hunting. If the improvement was only transitory and diminishes immediately after the intervention is concluded, little client benefit can be derived from training. Generalization across physical setting or environment refers to the presence of the skill under different \"surrounding\" conditions than those of training. If training physically takes place within an office at a clinic, hospital, or school, but if the real troublesome situations occur in a client\\'s home, workplace, or with friends and neighbors, the client must exhibit his or her new ways of handling the natural environment situation when it actually occurs. Generalization across interpersonal situations. Itis not possible for clients in social-skills training to rehearse handling every possible troublesome situation they will encounter. In assertive-training, one can construct a series of role-play approximations of the situations that a client reports difficulty in handling effectively. However, that individual will inevitably encounter other different situations in the natural environment that also call for assertive responses but that never were specifically rehearsed. In these cases, clients must generalize their use of newly acquired social skills to interpersonal situations slightly different than those that had originally been the subject of trainingorrehearsal. Thisarguesagainstteachingclientssimplyto\"memorize\" specific things to say or to do in specific situations, which might have limited generalization potential; instead they should learn a more general way to approach and behave in a given type of situation. Specific training techniques for incorporating the principles of instructions, modeling, rehearsal, and feedback or reinforcement will be discussed more fully in Chapter 4; procedures for enhancing generalization will also be pre-sented in detail later. However, the majorapproaches for fostering generalization of social skills from the training setting to the natural environment include: (1) selecting situations for rehearsal or practice which approximate, as closely as possible, the actual troublesome situations experienced by a given client; (2) presenting a variety of role-play or practice rehearsal situations during training to increase the likelihood that a client will exhibit the skill under stimulusdiffering conditions; (3) focusing training so that clients learn and understand the general principles of their training, rather than simply memorizing what to 32 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions say in a situation; (4) making clients aware of situations in their daily environment that they can use to try out newly acquired skills; (5) directly reinforcing clients when they report using, or are observed to be using, the newly acquired skill behaviors in the natural environment; and (6) directly modifying clients\\' cognitive self-statements so that cognitions facilitate socially skilled behavior, rather than inhibit it. These generalization procedures can enhance the initial performance of new social skills in the intended natural environment; once more adaptive, functional skills become well established in the client\\'s repertoire, naturally occurring reinforcement can then take over to maintain their use. One Skills-Training Intervention That Illustrates Social-Learning Treatment Principles Let us briefly examine one social-skills training study to more concretely illustrate the general application of instruction, modeling, rehearsal, feedback, and reinforcement within treatment sessions. Hollandsworth, Glazeski, and Dressel (1978) reported their treatment of a 30-year-old college graduate who experienced extreme anxiety during placement-service job interviews on campus. Although the client had good academic credentials, he had been unable to obtain a job offer after more than 60 unsuccessful interviews. Before treatment was initiated, role-play assessment or \"diagnostic\" job-interviews were conducted; in these role-plays, a therapist acted as the interviewer and directed a series of standard interview questions to the client. Evaluation of this role-play performance indicated the client\\'s need to make direct, unambiguous, or focused responses to the interviewer\\'s questions; to direct relevant questions to the interviewer; to maintain eye contact and verbal composure; and so on. With these behaviors isolated as components of job interview effectiveness in which the client was deficient, training sessions were then initiated. Each session began with a brief discussion between the therapist and the client regarding the component or aspect of effective interview behavior that was to receive training that day. Instruction, examples, and the rationale for the component were presented by the therapist. A modeling videotape was then shown; the film demonstrated a socially skilled individual being interviewed for a job and exhibiting all components or aspects of skill in that situation. The client was asked to focus his attention on how the model exhibited the skill component that was to receive attention in that day\\'s training session. Immediately after the modeling exposure, the client himself engaged in the role-play interview, with the therapist playing the part of the interviewer. This \"in-session\" role-play provided the client with an opportunity for actual pracThe Social-Learning Theory Model of Skills-Acquisition 33 tice or behavior rehearsal of the skill. The client\\'s practice interview was videotaped and then replayed with both the client and the therapist watching it. Feedback, corrective instruction, and reinforcement were provided by the therapist as each observed the videotape of the client\\'s just-completed practice role-play interview. Training sessions continued until all previously deficient aspects of the client\\'s job interview behavior were successively improved during practice interviews, and the client was encouraged to use his newly acquired skillsduring genuine interviews outside ofthe treatmentenvironment. Happily, Hollandsworth et al. (1978) reported that the client obtained job offers on each of his first three genuine interviews following the completion of training. This example illustrates quite clearly how the socialleaming principles of instruction, modeling, rehearsal, reinforcement, and feedback can be incorporated to increase the skills of an interpersonally deficient client. Whether conducted with an individual client or with a group of clients, social skills training applies to behavior in the training session those learning principles that account for skills acquisition in the natural environment. As we have noted, social-skills learning in the natural setting often occurs under incomplete or unfavorable circumstances, including few opportunities to practice a given skill, inadequate observation of appropriately skilled models, inconsistent reinforcement or feedback from others, and so on. However, within the treatment setting, it is possible to create an environment conducive to the development of skilled behavior by applying the same learning principles in a more consistent, potent, and directed manner. We will consider the implementation of these techniques in more detail in Chapter 4. Let us now turn our attention toward identifying the exact behaviors that can be taught to skillsdeficient clients and the procedures that can be used to assess client social behavior. Chapter 3 Assessing Client Social Competency and Identifying Skills for Training Before any skills-training can take place, it is essential to consider the issue of client assessment. In this chapter, we will review four aspects of the socialskills assessment that precedes a treatment intervention itself. First, a therapist must determine the kind of skills-training that is needed for a given client and obtain rather specific examples of real-life situations that require that skill and in which the client currently experiences difficulty. Next, the therapist constructsapproximations ofthose specific interpersonalproblemsituationswithin the training or clinic setting so that the client\\'s method of handling them can be scrutinized. In order to evaluate the adequacy of the client\\'s behavior in these sample interactions, it is necessary for the therapist to know what behaviors or components make up a skilled interaction; for this reason, we will review those components that appear to comprise various forms of social competency. The final aspect of assessment is to then compare how the client behaves in the sample interaction with those behaviors that comprise skill in that kind of interaction. This is accomplished by objectively rating various elements of the client\\'s social behavior; when the client fails to exhibit behaviors or components known to contribute to social skill, they can then be identified or targeted for training attention in the treatment intervention itself. Determining the Purpose or Goal Skill for a Training Intervention In the preceding chapters it was noted that \"social-skills training\" is the general description ofa behavior change approach, but one that can be applied to many different varieties or types of interpersonal skills. It is therefore necessary to identify exactly what kind of social skill a given intervention is intended to increase. Wecantermthisfinal, desiredendproduct oftrainingthe\"goalsocial skill\" of the intervention. 34 Assessing Client Social Competency and Identifying Skills 35 Social-skills training is intended to teach clients to more effectively interact with others in certain kinds of situations. For example, refusal-assertion training increases the competence of persons to handle situations in which others may take advantage of them or attempt to stifle their right to expression. Cooperative-play-skills training is intended to increase the ability of children to make friends in situations that provide the opportunity to interact with peers. Similar goal skills, such as effective date-initiation, conversational abilities, job-interview skills, or commendatory assertion, are each competencies that are needed in a particular kind of interpersonal situation (meeting a person one would like to date, meeting an unfamiliar person, being interviewed for a job, etc.). When clients consistently report having difficulty in handling a certain kind of interpersonal situation, or when they are observed by others to have difficulty in those situations, skills-training tailored to the problematic interactions is indicated. Let us consider several case examples illustrating how the need for skills training might be discovered during an early interview or therapy session with a client. Kathy is a 19-year-old who is attending a local junior college while living at home with her parental family. Her initial presenting and identified problems include loneliness, an absence of friends, and discomfort when meeting others for the first time. This discomfort is sufficiently great that she actively avoids situations where she will need to talk with others at any length. She also reports becoming depressed over the past few months. The therapist is aware, and indeed Kathy is aware, that her feelings of loneliness are a result of her failure to meet others, engage them in conversations, and develop friendships. Kathy says that she would very much like to have friends, but simply does not. When questioned about why she cannot more actively meet others and establish social relationships with them, Kathy reports that she has always been shy, it has been difficult for her to talk with people for as long as she can remember. and she often doubts whether she has anything interesting to talk about with others. Kathy spends most of her time studying, reading, and engaged in other solitary pursuits. During the interview, it is apparent that Kathy does appear very shy, speaking in a soft and tentative voice, and rarely looking directly at the therapist. Even with this relatively limited information, one can form some preliminary observations concerning the client\\'s area of social skill deficit. We can hypothesize that this client appears to lack the skills needed to initiate and maintain everyday conversations with others; because of this deficit, she has developed few close relationships and is reporting the emotional feelings of isolation, loneliness, and depression. While there seem to be opportunities for establishing friendships, such as during interactions with other students on campus, she feels ill-equipped and anxious about taking advantage of those situations. An aim of social-skills training in this case might well be teaching Kathy the skills needed to initiate and maintain informal conversations 36 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions with others. From this perspective, by directly enhancing the client\\'s conversational repertoire, it will be possible to equip her with the skills needed to meet others, make friends, and consequently, improve her self-evaluation and confidence. Robert is a 35-year-old middle-management employee in a large company. He has cometoamental healthcliniccomplaining ofjobdissatisfaction, ashorttemper, and feelings of frustration in his work and, more generally, his life. He has become irritated with his family, especially after \"bad days\" at work; occasionally, this takes the form ofanger, while at other times Robert becomes sullen and uncommunicative. The focus of the clinic interview has been narrowed to Robert\\'s work environment, since it appears that many of his difficulties arise there. Upon specific questioning, the client discusses several problem areas at work. One involves his interactions with subordinates who are accountable to him in the department he supervises. Robert reports difficulty confronting them about lax performance and their failure to adopt procedures he feels must be followed. It appears that Robert rarely asserts himself with subordinates on matters involving inadequacies in their job performance and fails to clearly communicate his opinions and positions. Consequently, his department\\'s overall performance is poor and Robert is himself beginning to get pressure from his own bosses to \"shape things up.\" This is frustrating for Robert because he wishes to be liked by his subordinates and certainly doesn\\'t want to be thought of as an aggressive, hostile supervisor. Robert adds that he also has trouble speaking up in company meetings with other managers and does not feel he can offer opinions to them, either. At the end of the interview, both Robert and the therapist agree that many of the problems stem from his unsatisfactory handling of interpersonal situations at work. This interview summary illustrates a case in which an individual seems unable to assert himself satisfactorily with others in the work environment. Thus, assertion training is the type of skill intervention that would appear most usefuL Since the troublesome situations are reportedly confined to interactions with others at work (involving subordinates, professional peers, and supervisors), assertion training might be even more specifically targeted toward those situations. Once again, determining the type of skills-training needed for this client requires that the therapist identify those situations that were reported to be problematic. Whereas for Kathy, conversational and social initiation competencies were deficient, the type of skill that Robert appears to lack involves the expression of refusal assertion in work-related interactions. Some clients may be able to identify, quite quickly and accurately, the nature oftheir interpersonal difficulties andthe exact situations they find troublesome. Some persons may even be able to identify the kinds of skills-training they will need (they may say: \"I need to learn to behave more assertively with people who try to take advantage of me\"; or \"I get very nervous in job interviews and just do not come across effectively\"). However, many clients are unable to easily identify problem areas. It is frequently necessary for the therapist to Assessing Client Social Competency and Identifying Skills 37 evaluate or infer whether or not a client\\'s difficulties are a result ofthe inability to handle interpersonal situations and, if so, the exact nature of those situations that consistently prove troublesome. Once this can be assessed, it is possible to then detennine the type of skills-training that will be most useful. Client reports of how they behave with others, or their descriptions of social situations they find difficult, provide one source of infonnation on the type of social-skills training that is needed. Another source of similar infonnation is through the direct observation of a client\\'s social interactions. The staff of a state hospital residential program for emotionally disturbed adults has long observed the very low quality of informal social interactions among patients in the program. In the day activities lounge of the facility, most patients sit by themselves, often staring aimlessly and almost unaware of the other individuals around them. The principal free-time activities were predominantly solitary in nature and usually consisted of watching television, reading, or smoking cigarettes. Most clients in the hospital had been diagnosed as schizophrenic, but very few were actively psychotic or acutely disturbed at present; instead, the general atmosphere was one of withdrawal, lack of social responsiveness (other than during structured activities such as recreational therapy), and isolation. Because of an increased emphasis on deinstitutionalization and community-based services, many of these patients would soon be leaving the residential facility to live, or perhaps to work, in thecommunity. However,theprogramstaffwaswellawarethatthesepatientswould have great difficulty establishing relationships, finding and obtaining employment, andadjustingtothe socialdemands ofcommunityliving. Couldtheybetaught, quite simply, to look and act less like \"former mental patients\" before they left the hospital? As we noted earlier, clients in residential facilities often exhibit social-skill deficits in a number of areas. These deficits are often sufficiently severe and long-standing that it is necessary to rely on staff observations rather than client reports to suggest the need for skills-training. For example, the patient who has been socially withdrawn for a considerable period of time may not have the appropriate skills to initiate interactions and may not even find interactions to be reinforcing any longer. Here, treatment might be based more upon staff observations of the need for social-skills training than the patient\\'s own descriptions of troublesome interpersonal situations. The type of skills-training intervention is detennined by the deficits observed in individual patients or groups of patients, as well as the interpersonal situations they will need to handle effectively in the future. Patients who hope to work following hospital discharge might benefit from training in the effective handling of job interviews. Patients who are passive and susceptible to being exploited by others could benefit from assertiveness training; still others may require general conversational-skills training. Children represent another population group whose appropriateness for 38 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions social-skills training must often be based on external observation. Because many children have difficulty accurately verbalizing interpersonal problems, information on the types of situations the child cannot handle effectively may principally come from therapist observations, as well as observational reports from teachers and parents. Tanuny, a 5-year-old girl, was brought to the clinic by her parents, who were concerned about the child\\'s peer difficulties at school. Tammy\\'s teacher also had recommended that the child receive assistance. The parents reported that Tammy was an only child who was doing well academically in her first-grade class. However, she appeared to have trouble making friends and preferred activities in which she did not have to interact with other children. The parents reported that their daughter rarely had friends over to the house, although the parents would welcome friendsiftheyweretovisit. OnthoseoccasionswhenTammy\\'sparentshadobserved herplayingwithothers. sheseemedaloof, shy, andsoughtoutthecompany ofadults nearby rather th:m other children. The parents reported no family difficulties nor other recent problems. Contacted over the telephone by the therapist, Tammy\\'s teacher confmned this pattern of social isolation. When the therapist inquired about specific examples ofTanuny\\'sbehavior, the teacherindicated that during recess, the child would invariably play by herself rather than with others. Also, during unstructured classroom activities, such as art projects, Tammy would always work alone. The teacher felt that Tanuny had no friends and appeared unhappy. Other children had becotne disinterested in Tanuny because she made no efforts to reciprocate any oftheirapproaches toward her; occasionally, classmates wouldpickonher by calling her names. During the clinic interview, Tammy was generally quiet and provided little information. She said that she got along well with her parents and had fun with them. However, when she was asked who were her best friends at school, she shook her head and said that she didn\\'t have any. In thiscaseexample, relativelyfew details oftheproblemcouldbepresented by the child client herself. The teacher had greater opportunity to observe and detail those situations that were troublesome for the child. The formulation at which we might arrive based on the information presented here is that Tammy lacks social skills needed to interact with peers. This seems particularly true in the case of free play or unstructured classroom activities. Because Tammy does not exhibit social skills in her relationships with classmates, they find her an unrewarding play partner and largely ignore her presence. The aim of treatment might most logically be to increase the child\\'s skills for initiating verbal interactions with peers, joining others in play, and then playing cooperatively with them. If such peer-valued social behaviors could be increased, it is likely that Tammy would gain greater acceptance by others, be included in their activities, and eventually come to value social play more than solitary activities. To summarize, the type of skills training needed for a given client is determined by the nature of those social situations in which difficulty is Assessing Client Social Competency and Identifying Skills 39 experienced. Initial infonnation can be obtained by carefully interviewing the client to detennine the nature of troublesome situations, or by direct observation of a client\\'s interpersonal deficits if he or she is in a residential setting, school, or some other observationally accessible environment. Gathering Specific Information on Troublesome Social Interactions If it were possible for a therapist to follow a client about all day every day, eventually the therapist would see the individual encounter some of the situations that are reported to be troublesome. The therapist could then observe just how the client behaved in those situations and would be in a position to closely pinpoint deficiencies in the client\\'s handling of troublesome interactions. Unfortunately, this kind of direct, exhaustive observation is almost never possible and the therapist must devise some alternative, time-efficient strategy to assess a client\\'s social skill behavior. This can be accomplished by devising sample interaction tasks to approximate the situation that a client does not seem to handle well at present. Let us take the case example of Robert, as it was described earlier. We recall that the clinical fonnulation in this example was that Robert seemed unable to assert himself in the work environment, most particularly during interactions requiring firmness and making opinion statements to his subordinate employees and his fellow managers. According to our initial fonnulation, Robert\\'sgeneralfeelings offrustration andirritabilitycouldbeattributed tohis ineffectual handling of such problematic work situations. Thus, assertiveness training appeared a reasonable treatment approach. However, we still have not leamed much about the exact situations that this client appears to have difficulty handling, and we know very little about his precise current behavior in those situations. A more thorough interview is needed to generate specific examples of situations that Robert finds difficult. Whom, exactly, does he have trouble with? Can we pick several situations that have actually occurred over the past week and detennine what circumstances led up to them, the basis for the conflict, what the other person said to him, how heresponded, andsoon?The aim ofthis detailed inquiry is to leam andnote, as precisely as possible, the exact situations that present difficulty. In some cases, a client simply does not engage in difficult social interactions. One example of this was Kathy, the shy 19-year-old student who felt awkward during conversational interactions and could establish few friendships. Here, it was not readily possible to leam more about difficulties she had while engaging in interactions, because she routinely avoided them. In this case, the therapist might discover examples of those situations where Kathy could meet others. Upon detailed questioning, the therapist might discover that Kathy has the opportunity to converse with others before classes, at the campus cafeteria, 40 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions during infonnal \"mixers\" at school, and during the course of church volunteer work. Again, the interview is directed toward identifying, in precise fashion, specific occasions when more adaptive social skills could be exhibited. There are several reasons why the therapist must pinpoint the exact interpersonal-environmental situations where a client experiences difficulties or where more adaptive social skills will need to be exhibited. The first is that training cannot be conducted in an abstract fashion. For example, if one teaches assertiveness, the aim is not to teach assertive responses to abstract, hypothetical situations. Instead, we seek to teach more adaptive skills for use in those situations that the individual client personally finds difficult. Since assertion is situational in nature, it is likely that the situations in which one client needs to be assertive are not the same situations in which another client needs to be assertive. Thus, to appropriately individualize training, it becomes important to detennine the precise situations that a given client finds troublesome. In similar fashion, assessment preceding other fonns of social-skills training should be tailored to those specific situations that a client wishes to handle better. Apart from ensuring that the training intervention is targeted towards those situations that an individual client personally finds difficult, the therapist also needs specific situational infonnation to construct relevant behavior assessment situations. To continue with our assertion example, when we learn the exact interpersonal situations that the client reports as troublesome, we will then be able to construct assessment role-plays that duplicate those same situations. This will pennit behavioral assessment sample interactions that closely approximate the situations that the client will need to handle more effectively. While some clients are able to provide specific examples of past difficult interpersonal situations or are able to pinpoint those situations they would like to handle better in the future, many clients are unable to provide this detailed infonnation in a single interview. In those cases, it may be useful to ask the client to self-monitor interpersonal problems that he encounters between interview sessions with the therapist. This might take the fonn of a daily diary recording procedure. Depending upon the type of skills-training intervention anticipated, clients might be asked to record each day those social situations in which they felt frustrated, wished they had asserted their opinions, had the opportunity to meet new friends, wanted to initiate a date, and so on. When clients record this infonnation between initial interview sessions to bring their recordings to the therapist, they should record the events briefly but with sufficient specificity that the therapist can make an assessment of the interpersonal situations that closely approximate the actual troublesome interactions experienced by the client. In the case of children with social-skills deficits or lower-functioning adults with very limited skills repertoires, it may prove more desirable to have someone make such recordings who is in a position to closely observe the client. Thus, a teacher might keep a record detailing the interperAssessing Client Social Competency and Identifying Skills 41 sonal situations in which a child was observed to have peer difficulty at school, or the staff of a residential facility might record those situations in which an institutionalized client seems to exhibit the most severe social-skills deficits. This information-gathering phase of assessment continues until the therapist bas a clear understanding of those specific interactions in the natural environment in which the client seems to exhibit social-skills deficits. When we can describe the exact interpersonal situations that have caused problems in the past, or can identify quite precisely the interpersonal situations that we wish the client to handle well in the future, it is possible to devise approximations of those interactions for behavioral assessment purposes. Constructing Role-Plays, Semistructured and Unstructured Interactions within the Treatment Setting There are several ways for the therapist to create behavioral assessment interactions in the clinic or treatment setting to sample the client\\'s initial or pretreatment social competence. These are role-plays, semistructured extended interactions, and unstructured extended interactions. Each requires that the client interact with some other person, with the therapist observing the client\\'s skill during the simulated interaction. Let us consider how each of these techniques can be used. Structured Role-Play Assessment Procedures Role-play techniques for assessing social skills appear most useful when the client must learn how to respond to the relatively structured or discrete comments and behavior of another person. Types of skills interventions that often rely on role-play assessment include those targeting refusal and commendatory assertion capabilities, as well as job-interview skills. In eachofthesecases, itis possible to structure the behavior of a role-play partner by having that partner make planned comments to the client. For example, in a refusal assertion role-play, a partner can make unreasonable comments to the client and the therapist can observe the adequacy of the client\\'s assertive response. In commendatory assertion role-plays, the partner might make warm or complimentary comments directed to the client; in job-interview skills assessment role-plays, the partner could play the part of an interviewer and direct standard interview questions to the client. In these forms of role-play assessment, <the partner\\'s behavior is structured, scripted, or planned; the situation that is being role-played duplicates a situation that the client wishes to handle more adequately; and the therapist observes the adequacy of the client\\'s role-played response. Most role-plays used in social-skills assessment consist of three parts: (1) a Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions narrated background description of the particular situation in which the client frods himself or herself; (2) some comment made by a role-play partner and directed to the client; and (3) the client\\'s response to the partner. Material presented in the narrated description of a role-play scene is derived from information provided by the clienton actual troublesome situations. Robert, the unassertive manager used as an earlier example, may have told the therapist thatone ofthe problems heencounteredat workwas dealingeffectively with an employee who always came in late. The therapist could learn details of this situation, including the time that the employee usually came in, what the employee said to Robert, the sex of the employee, and so on. From this information, a role-play might be constructed as follows: Narrated Description: \"Imagine that you are at work one morning and itis now 9:30. One of your employees, Bill Smith, bas just come in the door. He was due in at 9:00 and has just missed an important sales appointment. This has happened several times in a week and you are not happy with his continued failure to come in on time.\" Role-Play Partnerts Comment (to the Client): \"Good moming, Robert. Traffic was really bad today.\" CUeDtts Response (to Role-Play Partner): In this role-play example, the focus ofthe therapist\\'s attention is evaluating the client\\'s response to the partner\\'s comment. However, here there is only one structured comment made by the partner and only one response made by the client. It is often desirable to extend the role-play interaction by adding an additional partner comment (and an additional opportunity for the client to respond) within the same scene. For example, following Robert\\'s ftrst response, the role-play partner might then say, \"I\\'m only thirty minutes late.\" Robert is then given a second opportunity to respond in the same role-play scene. A similar role-play approach has been used in job-interview skills assessment. Here, the scene description \"sets thestage\" for a simulatedjobinterview. The partner, playing an interviewer, delivers questions, while the client plays the part of the applicant: Narrated Desc:ription: \"Imagine that you have applied for a job as a salesman at the EvergreenShoeCompany. Youarein theofficeofMr. Wills, thesalesmanager, and you are being interviewed by him. After setting down your application form, he says: RoIe.Play Partnerts Comment (to the Client): \"I don\\'t like to read application forms. Can you tell me about your experience?\" Clientts Response (to Role-Play Partner): In this example, the role-played interview would not be confined to a single Assessing Client Social Competency and Identifying Skills 43 question and answer. Instead, the partner delivers a second question following the conclusion of the client\\'s first response, and continues doing so until a reasonable number of interview questions have been asked. The client\\'s responses to all of the questions can then be evaluated. Logistics of the Role-Play Assessment Procedure Conducting assessment role-plays ideally requires the presence of three persons: the therapist; a second treatment staff-person, who functions as the role-play partner; and the client. The therapist can serve as the scene narrator andas observerofthe client\\'sresponseswhile the role-play interactionis taking place. Physical setting requirements for role-plays are minimal; role-plays can easily take place in an ordinary office, with the partner and the client seated in chairs facing one another. Since the therapist is not ordinarily involved in the interaction itself, he or she should be positioned to observe the role-play unobtrusively, such as from a corner ofthe room and out of the client\\'s line of sight. It is important that the client understand the nature and purpose of any role-play assessment. Specifically, clients should be instructed to imagine that they are actually in the situation described to them and that the partner is actually the other person in that imagined situation. The client is to interact directly with the partner, avoiding parenthetical comments to the observing therapist during the role-play. Clients should be instructed to behave in the role-play just as they normally would act if the situation were genuine. When role-play-assessment precedes a skills-training intervention, it is also important that the evaluation be quite comprehensive and sample the client\\'s behavior across a number of situations requiring the use of a certain type of social skill. Thus, if a client appears unassertive and if earlier interview or self-monitoring data generated nine different examples of problematic situations where that client could have been more assertive, it would be desirable to construct separate role~play scenes for each of those situations. In the case of job-interview training, there is only one situation that will receive treatment attention(theinterviewitself), butwithinaninterviewareanumberofdifferent questions that will be asked ofan applicant. Therefore, an assessment role-play job interview should include a variety of different questions that applicants must know how to answer. Another practical issue when constructing role-plays of social situations involves planning the behavior of the partner. In most cases, the role-play partner\\'s behavior should be planned and structured before the assessment session takes place. For example, the partner may follow a written script ofthe role-played interaction that speciftes what comments the partner will direct to the client for each role-play situation. 44 Social~Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions Validity Issues in Role-Play Client Assessment A central assumption of role-play assessment procedures is that clients\\' behavior in structured role-plays approximates the manner in which they really behave during similar interpersonal situations in the natural environment. Several recent studies have provided evidence that this assumption may not always be warranted, and that clients\\' responses during role-plays do not always predict the way they will handle similar situations outside of the clinic assessment setting (cf. Bellack, Hersen, & Lamparski, 1979). It appears plausible that this may be due to clients\\' perception of the setting in which assessment takes place. Most clients are likely to perceive role-plays as relatively safe and nonthreatening; if one behaves assertively toward a role~play antagonist, it is not likely that any real negative consequence to the client will occur.In the natural environment, clients may be less certain of the consequences of their assertion toward an antagonist and may inhibit behaviors they can emit in the assessment role~play. In spite of this potential limitation, it does appear likely that role-play assessment offers more detailed, accurate, and training-relevant information on client social-skill behavior than do more traditional assessment techniques. For example, a number of client self-report inventories on assertion and other social skills have been developed (cf. Gay, Hollandsworth, & Galassi, 1975; Twentyman & McFall, 1975; Watson & Friend, 1969; Wolpe & Lazarus, 1966). While these can be useful as general self-report screening devices, they provide little information on the exact situations that clients find difficult or on the client\\'s actual behavior in those situations. Several steps can be taken to maximize the validity of role-play clientassessment procedures. First, and as noted earlier, it is important that all role~play situations or scenes be individualized to a client\\'s own needs. Some investigators have developed standadized sets of role-play scenes to assess client assertiveness across a number of situations, such as having someone cut in front of the client in a lunch line, being served an overcooked steak in a restaurant, being overcharged for car repairs, and so on (cf. Eisler, Miller, & Hersen, 1973; Eisler, Hersen, Miller, & Blanchard, 1975). While the use of standardized role-play scene batteries to measure client assertiveness is useful in social skills research, it is preferable to \"tailor\" or individualize role-play scenes in clinical applications of social-skills training. Similarly, job~interview skills assessmentusing role-played interviews will be validonly ifthe role-play interviewer asks the same kinds of questions that a client will be asked in a genuine interview. A related strategy to increase the validity of role-play assessment is to ensure that role-play scenes are presented as realistically as possible and that cues from the troublesome situations in the natural environment are included accurately in the role-plays of those situations. For example, if a client has particular Assessing Client Social Competency and Identifying Skills 45 difficulty interacting with opposite-sex persons, the role-play partner should also be an opposite-sex individual. If a client reports trouble in self-assertion primarily when an antagonist acts hostile or angry, the role-play person should direct comments to the client in a hostile tone. A role-play assessment scene will be most valid when it closely approximates the stimulus characteristics of the intended situation in the natural environment. A final validity issue involves the reactivity of role-plays. Some clients appear able to adjust quickly to the idea of a role-play by interacting directly with the partner, actually imagining themselves in the situation being roleplayed, anddisregardingthe presenceofthetherapistobservingtheinteraction. Other clients may have greater difficulty role-playing situations and feel self-conscious, uncomfortable, and nongenuine. Certainly, one would not expect skills-deficient clients to handle role-plays of troublesome situations effectively and without discomfort, since they presumably do not handle these situations well in the natural environment. Thus, feeling embarrassed or not knowing what to say in a role-play may accurately reflect the client\\'s deficient behavior during similar in-vivo situations and provide important information on later training needs. However, it is desirable to repeat the same role-plays on several different occasions before training is initiated. This permits the client to grow accustomed to the role-play procedure and permits the therapist to obtain a more stable, consistent initial baseline of the client\\'s social competency in the assessment situations. Semistructured Extended-Interaction Assessmenl Procedures While role-plays are useful when the therapist is seeking to learn how clients handle the relatively specific comments or behavior of other people, some forms of social interaction cannot easily be duplicated with a role-play partner who makes standard or predetermined comments to the client. This seems particularly the case in more extended interactions such as conversations or date-initiation. Here, it would be difficult to \"script\" the comments ofapartner during simulations of these situations, and semistructured, extendedassessment interactions may prove more useful. In the assessment of clients\\' conversational skills, several studies have used paradigms in which the client is asked to interact with another person for a set period oftime (see Kelly, Urey, & Patterson, 1980). The partner in this contrived interaction is a confederate of the therapist, in the same manner that a role-play assessment partner was a therapist confederate. However, rather than requiring the client to respond to fixed comments delivered by the partner, in the extended-assessment interaction the client and partner interact in a less structured fashion. Asanexampleofthistechnique, wemightconsideragainthecaseofKathy, the shy 19-year-old who reported difficulty meeting other people. Based on 46 Social~SkillsTraining: A Practical Guide for Interventions interview or self-monitoring data, the therapist may have learned that Kathy has the opportunity to meet other people at her campus snack bar, where students congregate informally between classes. However, she rarely initiates interactions with others there and the therapist would like to assess her current conversation-initiation skills. A semistructured procedure for doing this might involve first presenting Kathy with a hypothetical situation description, as follows: Narrated description: \"Imagine, Kathy, that you have just walked into the snack bar on campus between your classes. You have some free time, so you buy a coke and look for a place to sit down. The snack bar is quite full today and there are no empty tables. You spot a table with one other person at it and decide to sit there. The other person is a guy who is having a soft drink. You have seen him before, but have never spoken to him. As you sit down at his table, he looks at you and smiles.\" In this example, the therapist\\'s description again sets the stage for the assessment interaction; the described hypothetical situation is based on material provided by the client. Because the interaction approximates a naturalistic situation, the client is being asked to role-play an interaction. However, this behavior sampling procedure is much less structured than the role-plays described in the previous section. Following the scene background narration, the client could be seated next to a conversational partner, with the partner playing the part of the male student, and the client assuming her own role as a student. For a set period of time, perhaps five minutes or ten minutes, the client and partner converse as though they were in the described snack-bar situation. The therapist again remains unobtrusive, observing but not engaged in the conversation. Because we are assessing the client\\'s skills, rather than those of the partner, it is useful to establish certain constraints on the partner\\'s behavior. These constraints provide the assessment with its semistructured quality. The partner might be instructed, before the assessment session, to play the role ofthe other person in the interaction and to \\':ad lib\" statements and behavior accordingly. However, the partner could also be told to follow several rules. These include always requiring the client to maintain conversational initiative by asking a question only if the client has just asked one, speaking no longer than 20 seconds at any time (such as when answering a client question), allowing any silences to last for a full 30 seconds before terminating them with a question to the client, maintaining consistently warm affect toward the client, etc. While these constraints do reduce somewhat the spontaneity of the interaction, they also ensure that the conversation will not be dominated by the partner. If that were to occur, it would not be possible to evaluate the client\\'s skills. The client could be told, before the interaction begins, that it will be necessary to maintain the conversation until the time period for it has elapsed. Assessing Client Social Competency and Identifying Skills 47 This semistructured interaction assessment approach can be modified for several types of skill-evaluation by altering the \"stage-setting\" description that precedes the situation. For example, to assess heterosocial date-initiation skills, the narrated background might describe asetting in which the client sees someone that he or she would like to date. The interaction partner could then be an opposite-sex person who, in this scenario, would be willing to accept a dating offer from the client. The client is instructed to interact with the partner for a set period of time, with the aim of obtaining a date, and the client\\'s behavior wbile doing so is assessed. Logistics of the Semistructured Assessment Procedure The staff requirements for tbis form of skills-assessment are the same as those for more structured role-plays: a therapist who sets the stage and observes the interactions, as well as a partner with whom the client actually interacts. Partner training is also required preceding the interaction-assessment session. However, rather than having the partner deliver specific predetermined comments to the client when role-playing each situation, it is important for the partner to follow general interaction \"rules\" as mentioned above. Just as it is useful to repeat structured role-play assessment on several occasions to reduce client reactivity to the procedure and establish a consistent baseline for the client\\'s skills, it is also useful to conductseveral semistructured interaction assessments. These might include varying somewhat the scene descriptions that introduce the interaction or varying the partner on different occasions. However, the interactions used to assess client skills should always be made to closely approximate actual situations that the client has difficulty in handling when they occur in the natural environment. Unstructured Interaction Assessment Procedures A form of social-skills assessment further removed from bighly structured role-plays is the observation ofclient interactions under conditions ofminimal structure. This method of evaluation is possible when the informal social interactionofclientswithoneanotherisbeingexaminedinaclinic oroffice, as well as on those occasions when it is feasible to observe the social interaction of clients in the natural environment. Observation of Clients\\' Skills during Unstructured Conversations with One Another Let us assume that a skills-training intervention is planned to improve the everyday conversational skills of a group of clients, such as individuals confined to some residential facility. The therapist may have observed that con48 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions versations between clients appear to be infrequent and of low quality, but these observations are based on fairly global, casual therapist observations. One way to more specifically assess the clients\\' conversational interactions is to ask two clients to sit down with one another in a room and carry on a conversation. The therapist might provide minimal structure for the interaction assessment, such as by directing the individuals to get to know one another better. However, the basic assessment format is the relatively unstructured interaction in which the clients engage. It is not a role-play, since neither client is playing the part of someone else and because no confederate is used. Instead, the therapist is sampling the interaction skills of each client, but under circumstances somewhat more controlled than by observing them in the in-vivo setting. Control is achieved because two clients are placed in a situation, removed from other persons, and are specifically asked to interact for some general purpose (getting to know one another better, learning more about one another, or so on). This form of skills-assessment is applicable when the aim of traning is to increase the everyday conversational skills exhibited by clients during conversations with one another. Here, the assessment situation (unstructured conversations between pairs of clients in a situation accessible to therapist observation) very closely approximates the setting and behavior being targeted for later training (unstructured conversational behavior between clients on a residential facility ward, a day treatment program, or similar setting). This procedure is also suitable when group social-skills training is planned to improve the skills exhibited by clients during their interactions with one another. However, because this procedure is unstructured and does not attempt to create any situation otherthan the actual conversation that is occurring between clients, its assessment utility is correspondingly limited. Because no interaction confederate partner is used, it is not possible to closely control the conversation\\'s content. Thus, if two clients were paired together for an unstructured assessment conversation and if one talked excessively throughout the time we observed them, it would be relatively difficult to evaluate the skills of the person who did not have an opportunity to talk. Assessment of Client Social Skills in the Natural Environment Earlier in this section, it was suggested that procedures such as client role-plays or semistructured extended interactions are intended to create, in a clinic setting, close approximations of interpersonal situations that a therapist cannot feasibly observe the client handling in the natural environment. Under some circumstances, however, it is possible for a therapist or some other skilled observertoclosely scrutinize the socialskills ofthe clientduring interactions in the natural setting. Direct observation of social behaviors in the natural or in-vivo environment may be possible when: (I) the client\\'s difficulties involve Assessing Oient Social Competency and Identifying Skills 49 interactions with other persons also in the observed environment; (2) the in-vivo setting lends itself to direct observation because the client spends a substantial amount oftime in that setting and can be observed closely while in it; and (3) the particular interactions of interest to the therapist occur relatively frequently or, at least, predictably. Tammy, the 5-year-old child who was reported to experience peer interaction problems and social isolation at school, represents a case where direct observation assessment could be conducted. Since Tammy\\'s difficulties involved her interactions with other children at school, and because she was with other children in the conf\"med school setting each day, it would seem feasible to directly observe how she behaved with them there. Recalling the teacher\\'s reports, we note that Tammy appeared to have difficulty establishing cooperative social interactions during unstructured activities, such as recess or group artprojects. Observation ofTammy\\'ssocialbehaviorcouldbefocusedonsuch times. A therapist or other observer might visit the school at recess, free-play, or group project times, and carefully observe Tammy\\'s social-skill behavior with other children as they interacted naturally. A similar in-vivo assessment procedure can be applied to other settings, such as the naturally occurring conversational interactions between patients in residential facilities. Again, it is important to conduct observations at times when clients have the opportunity to interact; the situations that are assessed should be the same as those situations that will be targeted for behavior change in the forthcoming intervention. Thus, ifan intervention were intended to increase the social-conversational skills ofpsychiatric patients while they are havingdinner together, the initial assessment should be conducted by an observer who evaluates their current conversaional behavior in the dinner setting. Direct observation of clients\\' social interactions during specifically identified situations in the natural environment is an appealing assessment strategy because actual in-vivo performance can be evaluated, rather than performance in contrived analogues of the troublesome situations. So long as a client\\'s manner of handling interpersonal situations during the time of observation is representative of how that client characteristically behaves. one does not have to be concerned about the validity of the assessment. On the other hand, there are several limitations associated with direct, naturalistic assessment of social competency. One is cost-efficiency. Although a client may be in a confined, \"observable\" setting, such as a school or residential facility, a therapist may not have sufficient time to conduct detailed in-vivo assessments. Although it is possible for other personnel, including teachers, aides, or nurses, to obserVe the social skills of a client in a particular type of situation, the observational specificity needed to usefully describe a client\\'s social-skill effectiveness requires that observers be trained rather extensively. As we will consider shortly, one must also be in a position to see and hear the client\\'s responses to other people to assess the adequacy of skill responses; being able to monitor a so Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions client\\'s behavior this closely in the natural environment can prove difficult and can cause clients to react to the close presence of an observer. Additionally, because the therapist is not \"setting up\" a situation known to be difficult for a client to handle, it may be necessary to observe clients for a considerable period of time before one can learn exactly how they are able to interact with others. For example, if we were to observe Tammy during a school recess period, we might fmd that she spent the entire period in solitary play, while all the other children were playing with one another. Although this would tell us that Tammy was isolated and noncommunicative with peers, it would not provide definite information on such important questions as whether she has the skills to initiate play with others, respond to prosocial advances from them, play cooperatively, assert herself, and so on. One way to better assess such specific capabilities is to structure peer tasks so that the social behaviors of interest can be observed more readily. This could be accomplished by arranging tasks that require the participation of the client and the exhibition of a certain kind of skill, such as working with several other children on a puzzle that requires social collaboration or on a project that requires cooperative behaviors (Berler, Kelly, & Romanczyk, 1980). Because the in-vivo social-skill observationalassessment techniques are quite specialized and are most often used to assess childrens\\' interpersonal skills, these procedures will be described more fully in Chapter 10. To summarize, once the therapist has identified the interpersonal situations that aclientappears tohandle ineffectively based on interview data, abehavioral-assessment procedure can be created to observe the client\\'s specific skill in such situations. These procedures include structured role-plays of troublesome situations (particularly useful for assertion or job-interview-skill assessment); semistructured extended social interactions (particularly suitable for conversational-or dating-skill assessment); or unstructured naturalistic observation of client behavior during everyday interactions with peers (especially suitable for someforms ofconversational-skillassessment and theevaluation ofchildren\\'s interaction skills with peers). When an assessment procedure has been selected and a sample of the client\\'s social-skill behavior can be obtained. it is then necessary to establish a technique to objectively evaluate the observed performance of the client and provide information on the skill behaviors that must be trained. A Component Analysis of Social Skills Beforewecanevaluate theadequacy ofthe skillthat aclientexhibits during any assessment sample interaction, we must first know what behaviors to look for. Specifically, what are the elements or behavioral components that when taken Assessing Client Social Competency and Identifying Skills 51 together, compriseaneffective handling ofthetype ofsituations withwhich the client currently has difficulty? In earlier chapters, the notion of analyzing social skills into their behavioral components was introduced briefly. The basic aim of this approach is to determine, quite objectively, what it is that socially skilled persons do when they are engaged in a certain type of interpersonal interaction. Exactly what does a terrific conversationalist do when meeting other people for the first time? How do successful daters go about asking other people do date them? If a personnel manager interviews a candidate and, afterward, feels that the applicant came across extremely well, what behaviors did the manager notice that led to such a positive reaction? Ifwe can accurately and reliably determine the behaviorsthat skilled persons exhibitwhen they are in the kind ofsituationsour client fmds troublesome, it should be possible to then teach the skills-deficient client those same behaviors. Table 3.1 presents a summary of behaviors that have been postulated to comprise various types of interpersonal skills, including refusal and commendatory assertion, conversational skills, date-initiation skills, job-interview skills, and prosocial-play interaction skills in young children. When one of thesegoalskillsisselectedasthetargetforintervention, thecontent oftraining focuses upon the component behaviors that constitute it. More detailed descriptions and examples of these components will be covered in our specialized chapters on each type of skills training (Chapters 7 through 10). However, several points about this table summary merit specific attention. When a social skill is defined by the behaviors of which it is comprised, it is important that those components be identified as objectively as possible. For example, using the data reported for heterosocial skills that are summarized in Table 3.1, observers could presumably watch a client as he is engaged in an interaction with an unfamiliar opposite-sex person and reliably \"see\" or \"count\" each of the behavioral components that occur. We could determine how much time the client was speaking, the frequencies ofverbally reinforcing comments made to the other person, head nods, smiles, statements disclosing information to the partner, and so on. These components of heterosocial competence are defined in a sufficiently objective, clear-cut, and behavioral manner that they can be observed and assessed unambiguously. Similarly, for other types of social skills, the component makeup of the goal \"product\" is also described in the most objective possible manner. Some investigators have established that the behavioral components they cite do differentiate persons competent in a skill from persons judged deficient in that skill. For example, Gottman, Gonso, and Rasmussen (1975) were able to establish empirically that popular children (based on peer-nomination sociometric measures) differed from unpopular children on some of the behavioral components indicated in Table 3.1. These included popular children\\'s TABLE 3.1.

In similar fashion, Minkin, Braukmann, Minkin, Timbers, Timbers, Fixsen, Phillips, and Wolf (1976) compared students judged to be highly competent during conversational interactions with those judged as less competent in order to determine those behaviors related to overall conversational skill. In other studies that have yielded information about the behavioral composition of social skills, skills-deficient clients are first taught to exhibit the behaviors that intuitively seem to be components ofthe goal skill. Then, more global judgments are obtained from external judges to conftrm that the clients are more proficient in the goal skill when exhibiting those component behaviors than before they had learned to exhibitthem. For example, Furman et al. (1979) and Kelly, Laughlin, Claiborne, and Patterson (1979) taught skills-deficient, formerly hospitalized psychiatric patients to increase their rates of such verbal behaviors as making positive statements about past einployment experience, making statements conveying interest in work, and directing questions to an interviewer about a prospective position during role-played job interviews. Later, genuine personnel managers listened to audiotape recordings of the clients\\' role-played interviews when the clients exhibited these skills (posttraining) and when they did not exhibit them (pretraining or baseline). Because the experimentally naive managers rated as higher the overall effectiveness of role-played interviews when these behaviors were exhibited, the authors concluded that the identified verbal behaviors were components of job-interview skill. While this procedure can establish that client use of the behavioral components is associated with higher evaluations of goal-skill competency, it does not provide information on the relative contribution ofeach separate skill component to the final competency judgment. For example, in these jobinterview training studies, it may have been that only one component, rather than all of them, was responsible for the personnel managers\\' favorable posttraining evaluations. In a good deal of previous social-skills training research, the behaviors proposed to be components of a skill and subsequently taught to skills-deficient individuals have been selected based only on intuitive speculation rather than on an empirically demonstrated relationship between those behaviors and external judgments ofcompetency in the skill. Thus, therapists and researchers typically train what they think are the important aspects of the desired competency. Wolf and his associates (see Minkin et al., 1976; Wolf, 1978) have pointed out the need to \"socially validate\" the behaviors taught to clients in skills-training interventions by relating training on the behavioral components to actual improvement in handling situations that the intervention is meant to target. Further basic social validation research is needed, and skills-training therapists might regard verbal or nonverbal components felt to comprise 57 Assessing Client Social Competency and Identifying Skills various social skills in a somewhat preliminary light until more empirical data are obtained. Several other issues concerning the component makeup of social skills can be briefly noted here, but will be discussed more fully when we tum our attention to training techniques in later chapters. The first is that most research has focused assessment attention on the frequency or presence of components making up a skillful response, rather than the manner in which these components are stylistically integrated with one another. As an example, Table 3.1 shows that conversational skill has been rather consistently analyzed. to include such verbal behaviors as asking questions to learn more about another person, self-disclosureofinformationabout one\\'sowninterests, providingfeedbackto one\\'s conversational partner, etc. However, it would be possible for an individual to do all these things during an interaction, but to do them in an awkward, poorly paced style. Ifsomeone \"shotgunned\" many questions to a person he had just met and then abruptly began talking about himself, he could be exhibiting the correct components but with an inappropriate style. Therapists who teach social skills might consider both the verbal or nonverbal components of that skill and the manner in which they are integrated, paced, and vary in response to the behavior of the other individual in the interaction (Kelly, in press). Although little empirical attention has been given to this aspect of social-skills assessment, therapists conducting interventions should be aware of the style with which clients exhibit skill components during assessment and training. A second, related issue involves the optimal extent or degree that even an appropriate behavior should be included in a skilled interaction. Sufficient eye contact has been identifiedas an important aspect ofvirtually all types ofsocial skill, and interventions routinely increase the amount of client eye contact when ithas been deficient. However, too much eye contact may be as unskilled as too little. There is probably an ideal rate for eye contact and, beyond that point, desirable eye contact becomes undesirable staring. This seems true for almost all of the component behaviors included in Table 3.1. While voice loudness, convincing affect, and gestures have all been proposed as appropriate nonverbal components of effective refusal assertion (see Edelstein & Eisler, 1976), each can become inappropriate ifit is exhibited excessively. Similarly, appropriate verbal behaviors in a job interview (e.g., conveying positive information about one\\'s work background or making statements conveying to an interviewer one\\'s interest in a prospective job) can be evaluated as inappropriate ifthey occur too often. While social-skills assessment and training have been characteristically oriented toward increasing currently deficient component behaviors of the desired skill, it must be within the context of increasing them only to optimum levels. In some cases, a therapist may even seek to decrease behaviors that are ordinarily considered appropriate, ifthey 58 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions occur so excessively they become inappropriate. Examples might include clients who overexhibit components such as eye contact or voice loudness, or those who excessively talk. Once again, additional research will be needed to determine the ideal occurrence rate for the appropriate component behaviors of a social skill. Let us summarize the component-analysis approach to social-skill description: Any type ofeffective goal skill can be broken down into the behaviors that are felt to comprise it. This would be conceptually akin to watching an individual who is competent in a certain kind of situation, and observing those exact verbal and nonverbal behaviors that the individual exhibits. Further, a skill\\'s makeup can be described in the most objective, behavioral manner possible by specifying the exact nature of those verbal statements and nonverbal acts that should be present in the skilled response or interaction. When planning a treatment intervention, it is crucial for the therapist to give early attention to conceptualizing not only the type of social skill that will be taught, but also the behavioral components that make up that goal skill. Behaviors such as those included in Table 3.1 can serve to assist the therapist in defining the composition of a desired type of social skill. Behavioral Assessment of Client Social Skill: btillS Performance in Sample Interactions When we analyze a client\\'s social-skill behavior sample, whether it is from a role-play, semistructured, or unstructured interaction, the aim is to locate iftadequacies of performance, which can be targeted for later training. What, exactly, can tell a therapist whether a client\\'s behavior in an assessment situation is adequate or deficient? We have already noted that any type ofsocial skill can be broken down into its behavioral components, such as in the component analysis presented in Table 3.1. If each identified component behavior of a skill is a necessary part ofthat skill, it is then possible to observe whether clients exhibit each of those components in their handling of assessment role-plays, semistructured, or unstructured interactions. Ifa client fails to include essential behavioral components in his or her assessment interaction, those components can be identified as deficient skill behaviors, which will need to be iacreased. To accomplish this evaluation, a therapist objectively rates the client\\'s observed performance on each of the component behaviors that compriae an effective skill. Objectively rating client behavior requires that the therapist evaluate the presmc:e, absence, or adequacy of many social-skill behavior components in the client\\'s interactions. This can be accomplished by simply watching as the client engages in a sample interaction. However, most of the social skills Assessing Oient Social Competency and Identifying Skills S9 described in Table 3.1 have at least six identifiable components. Because it can be somewhat difficult for a therapist to attend to many simultaneously occurring components, \"permanent product\" recordings of client behavior during assessment interaction sessions are often useful. In its simplest form, this can consistofaudiotapingclient performanceduringassessment role-plays orother interactions; the therapist will then be in a position not only to observe the client\\'s \"live\" interaction, but also to listen to the tape recording of it after the session ends and more carefully evaluate the client\\'s social behavior. While audiotape recordings are an economical and feasible way to generate permanent products of client performance, an obvious limitation is that the therapist cannot record information on certain nonverbal components of the client\\'s responses, including eye contact, gestures, smiles, and So on. There are several ways to circumvent this limitation. One is for the therapist observing the interaction to evaluate nonverbal componets \"live\" while actually watching the client in the assessment session; verbal behaviors could be rated from a later review of an audiotape. Alternatively, the confederate partner who is interacting with the client can also observe the client and, following the session, confer with the primary therapist on the adequacy of any nonverbal behaviors of interest in the assessment. It is also possible to videotape the client\\'s performance in the assessment session; both verbal and and nonverbal behaviors could then be rated from the videotape film at any time. Rating Techniques In order to fully evaluate the client\\'s baseline skill in handling whatever situations are presented during assessment, it is necessary to compare the components present in the client\\'s behavior with those behavioral components that will be present in ideal, skilled responses. Therefore, a first step in the skill rating procedure is to organize and list the components that the therapist will look for in the client\\'s assessment-sample interactions. We will first consider the rating of client performance in structured role-plays, such as assertion assessment role-play interactions; rating of more extended sample interactions will then be discussed. Figure 3.1 presents a sample form that illustrates bow a therapist can rate the client\\'s role-plays in situations requiring refusal assertiveness in response to the unreasonable comments delivered by a partner. Ifwe compare the components included on this rating form with the behavioral components that comprise refusal assertion in Table 3.1, it is evident that the rating procedure simply determines whether the client\\'s responses include each important skill component. Thus, a form like Figure 3.1 serves to guide tbe therapist in evaluating the quality or effectiveness of client role-play performance. Whenever one evaluates or rates client social competency, there must be a 60 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions dermed period that constitutes the observation interval. The form presented in Figure 3.1 is used to evaluate each separate assertive response made by the client. Thus, if the assessment session consists of the client role-playing 8 different situations, and if each role-play presentation includes one comment made by the partner to which the client must respond, a total of8 different client assertive responses can be rated. If, for each of the 8 role-play scenes, the partner directs 2 comments to the client (and the client must handle each of the partner comments with an assertive response), there would be 16 separate responses for rating, and so on. Objective rating of skill responses can FIGURE 3.1. Sampl~ Rating Form for Client\\'s Refusal-Assertion Role-Plays Client Name: _ Date of This Interaction: __ Type of Interaction: Pretraining Assessment Session Practice (Training Focused on What Component? _ Follow-up Description of This Role-Play Scene: _ COMPONENT BEHAVIORS 1.

Gestures (Did the client use any observable arm or hand gestures to add emphasis to his/her response?) Absent Present 61 Assessing Client Social Competency and Identifying Skills pinpoint both verbal and nonverbal inadequacies in the client\\'s manner of handling the antagonist\\'s comments. If we observe that a given individual maintains eye contact only about 20% of the time, speaks in a soft monotone, fails to state his or her own opinion, does not convey to the partner more acceptable future behavior, and punctuates responses with dysfluencies, each component will need to be targeted for later training. Over a number ofrole-played scenes, a client may exhibit relatively consistent deficiencies on certain behavioral components, such as never maintaining sufficient eye contact, always speaking too softly, and never exhibiting one of the verbal statement components. Such consistency ofdeficit supports the fact 5. understanding Statement/Statement of Problem (Did the client include in the roleplay response a statement conveying the nature of the conflict problem or a statement recognizing the antagonist\\'S position?)

Absent Present 7.

Absent Present 8. Speech Duration (Length of client\\'s role-play response, in seconds) Seconds 9. Other Components Being Rated (or any undesirable, inappropriate behavior being examined) Definition/Description of Behavior: Frequency Count or Rating: 62 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions that a given component of the skill will require training. On the other hand, clients may exhibit a certain component behavior inconsistently across scenes, including it in certain responses but not in others where it also would have been appropriate. The therapist might then try to determine if the differential performance is correlated with any aspect of the scene. For example, if a male client maintained eye contact while role-playing with male partners but not with female partners, it might signify greater anxiety during opposite-sex interactions and this would need to receive attention in training. On the other hand, a behavioral component may also be exhibited inconsistently because it simply is not well-established in the client\\'s skill repertoire; this would also suggest the importance of directing attention to it in the intervention. In assertion role-plays, the client\\'s responses are ordinarily somewhat brief and they follow the role-play partner\\'s structured comments. However, other forms of social-skill assessment interactions can be more extended and complex. Role-plays of job interviews might consist of an entire series of different interview questions delivered to the client by the role-play interviewer, and the client\\'s responses to those questions can become more elaborate. Similarly, conversational-and date-initiation-skill assessments may consist of relatively extended interactions, perhaps up to 10 minutes. Whether a client talks with a confederate in a semistructured assessment, or whether two clients are \"paired\" together in an unstructured evaluation oftheir conversational skills, the resulting sample interaction can also be rated to determine the frequency that a client exhibits identified behavioral components. For these types of social-skill assessment, the focus of therapist observation and rating is the client\\'s total behavior over the entire interaction. The Urey et al. (1979) and Kelly, Urey, and Patterson (1980) reports of conversationalskills training with formerly hospitalized psychiatric patients, mentioned in an earlier chapter, serve to illustrate this approach to skills rating. In these studies, each client interacted with a confederate partner for a fixed period of 8 minutes withthepurpose ofgettingtoknowthepartnerbetter. Theassessmentfollowed a semistrutured interaction format. To assess the client\\'s conversational-skill adequacy, the therapist observed and rated the entire 8-minute dialogue, tallying the total number of times a client made certain types of statements to the partner-questions directed to the partner, statements disclosing appropriate information about the client\\'s interests or background, reinforcing comments, and so on. Once again, components that are rated in this form of assessment should be the same as the components that are felt to make up an effective performance of the goal skill, such as those included in Table 3.1. Beyond the verbal conversational statements reported in the Urey et al. (1979) and Kelly, Urey, and Patterson (1980) studies, other components ofconversational skill that could also be rated in an assessment interaction include client eye contact, affect, speech loudness, and so on. By determining whether, and 63 Assessing Client Social Competency and Identifying Skills how frequently, such components occur over the entire interaction, it is again possible to pinpoint the extent to which a client is deficient in those specific behaviors that, taken together, comprise a desired goal skill. Ifthe individual is found to spend most of a conversational-assessment period gazing off and talking monotonously about himself, but only rarely asks questions to elicit information from the partner or rarely offers acknowledgments and reinforcing statements to the partner, the therapist then has important information on which conversational-skill components will need special attention in later training. Similarly, rating the performance of a client in a simulated job interview could consist of determining the frequency over the entire interview that the client exhibits each verbal skill-component (such as the total number of statements conveying positive information about past experience, to total number of times the client directs an appropriate question to the interviewer partner, and so on). Nonverbal component behaviors including eye contact, voice loudness, or affect cannot be rated by a frequency count; for each of these components, the therapist might use a rating scale format (such as a I to 7 scale from extremely poor to extremely good) to record the client\\'s general exhibition of the component over the entire interaction. The two kinds of rating procedures described here (evaluating behavioral skill-components present in client responses during structured role-play responses and determining the frequency of behavioral skill-components exhibitedduring more extendedassessment interactions) vary in terms ofthe period oftime when the client\\'s behavior is rated. However, the rationale and purpose for evaluation are always the same: to determine the extent to which clients exhibit component behaviors of a social skill during the sample social interaction that the therapist observes. The components comprising one type of social skill are different than the components comprising another type of skill. Therefore, the exact behaviors that are rated by the therapist must be tailored to the kind of social skill that the assessment situations \"tap\" and to the type of training intervention that is anticipated (assertion, conversational, date initiation, and so on). In the later specialized chapters on these various types of social-skills training, examples will be provided of sample rating forms to measure the components associated with specific skills, and component behaviors will be dermed more fully. In addition, assessment rating issues unique to each kind of skill will be discussed in their respective chapters. Chapter 4 Social-Skills Intervention Procedures for Individual Clients and Groups Following an initial and detailed assessment of social skills achieved through ratings of client performance during sample interactions, a therapist will next wish to give attention to the skills-training intervention itself. In this chapter, we will first consider the design and clinical utility of multiple-treatmentsession interventions. Attention will then be directed toward the procedural conduct of training sessions by reviewing exactly how the previously described principles of instruction, modeling, overt practice, reinforcement, and feedback can be incorporated into sessions for clients treated individually and in groups. Clinical techniques to foster generalization of social-skills improvement to the natural (criterion) environment will also be considered. Because social-skills training with children requires somewhat different training techniques, treatment procedures for skills-deficient children will be covered se~ arately, in Chapter 10. Multiple-Treatment-Session Interventions: A Clinical Overview Just as one can break down any type of social skill into its behavioral components, one can also break down a skills-training intervention into sessions, with separate sessions devoted to each of the behaviors that will be trained. For example, let us assume that a mentally retarded adolescent will receive training in conversational skills because he has great difficulty maintaining appropriate conversations with his peers. Several assessment conversations have been conducted; in each of these, the client was asked to interact with a confederate of the therapist for seven minutes. Ratings of the semistructured assessment interactions revealed that the adolescent exhibited deficits in at least five conversational component behaviors, each of which will be targeted for attention during the intervention. These behaviors included: (1) his rate of con- M Social-Skills Intervention Procedures 65 veying information about himself; (2) his ability to elicit information from the conversational partner; (3) verbal acknowledgments of the partner\\'s talk (such statements as \"Oh,\" \"Really,\" \"That\\'s interesting,\" \"I\\'d like to hear more about that\"); (4) his eye contact; and (5) his affect or emotional tone, which currently appears very dull and flat. One can break down the entire intervention into sessions that sequentially give training attention to each of these behavioral components. For example, following the assessment conversations, the first training sessions can focus on teaching the client to convey information about himself to others during conversations. When he has learned to do this successfully, the next set of sessions can be devoted to a second component, such as eliciting information from others during conversations by asking them questions. When this has been mastered, the clientwill then beexhibitingtwo ofthe five componentskills that had been initially targeted for training. Session attention can then be focused on the next identified component, and this continues until all behavioral components have been learned and are included in the client\\'s conversational repertoire. By moving systematically and cumulatively from one behavior to the next over the course of the intervention, the client should fully master the goal skillbytheend oftreatment. Whiletreatmentsessionssuccessivelytargeteach component, training is always cumulative, with the client continuing to exhibit previously trained behaviors even as new components are added. It may be useful to present an outline that illustrates a multiple-session skills-training intervention that successively targets components of a desired social skill. We can use the conversational skills-training project with the retarded adolescent as an example, and will assume that the five behavioral components each required two training sessions. Session l:Behavioral assessment of baseline or initial conversational skills: semistructured conversation with partner, rated by therapist. Session 2:Repeat same assessment conversations to establish stability of performance. Sessions 3 \" 4:Training on first component: How to convey information about oneself during a conversation.

The approach ofleaming the \"whole\" sldll by successively mastering each of its\"parts\" canbeappliedtoanykind ofsocialskill. Obviously,thecomponents that sequentiallyreceive training\\'attentionwill depend onthetype ofsocialskill being taught and the particular client deficits that were pinpointed during the behavioral assessment observations. This intervention format is well-suited for many applied settings, since it is based on multiple-session, ongoing contact with the same client. For example, the outpatient visits made by clients on a weekly or twice-weekly basis can constitute training sessions; over the course of one month with twice-weekly visits, an 8-session social-skills training intervention can take place. Similarly, since group therapy outpatient sessions usually occur on some regularly scheduled basis (such as weekly), group applicationofsocial-skillstraining canbeadaptedto the same multiplesession, weekly format. The scheduling of training sessions with clients in residential facilities affords still greater flexibility, since the sessions can often be arranged on a more frequent basis. Session Spacing and Duration of the Intervention The duration of a social-skills training intervention is determined by a number offactors, whichincludethefunctioninglevelandresponsiveness oftheclient, the complexity ofthe goal social skill being taught, the extent of skill deficiency exhibited by the client, and the spacing of training sessions. It is apparent that if one is teaching social skills to a relatively low-functioning person, including the mentally retarded and chronically institutionalized individual, considerably more training time may be needed before the client successfully masters a given component. On the other hand, high-functioning persons who grasp quickly the component behavior being targeted in a given session may proceed through an intervention much more quickly. As we have noted, the fact that an individual is low-functioning and severely skills-deficient does not mean that skills-training will be unsuccessful; many studies have reported successful assertive, conversational-sldll, and job-interview training with chronically institutionalized and retarded populations (cf. Furman et al., 1979; Kelly, Furman, Phillips, Hathorn, & Wilson, 1979; Kelly, Wildman, Urey, & Thurman, 1979; Monti, Curran, Corriveau, DeLancy, & Hagerman, 1980; Monti, Fink, Norman, Curran, Hayes, & Caldwell, 1979). However, because it is important that a client fully and consistently exhibit a given component behavior before proceeding to the next, increased sessions for each component may be necessary for low-functioning clients. It is often difficult to predict exactly how many training sessions a client will require. For this reason, it is Social-Skills Intervention Procedures 67 generally best to avoid setting, in advance, a duration for a skills-training intervention. Instead, applied interventions usually continue training a component until a level of consistent mastery has been reached (termed \"training to criterion\"), and only then move to the next component. Thecomplexity ofthe goal skill and the number ofcomponentson which the client is deficient initially will also determine the length of the intervention. If initial behavioral assessment reveals that a client is deficient in eight different verbalandnonverbalcomponents ofthedesiredskill, trainingwilltakecorrespondingly longer than if the client exhibits only minimal deficits. As we notedearlier, the aim ofskills-trainingis notsimplyto teachaclient to exhibit socially skilled performance during rehearsal within the training session and environment. Improvement must also generalize to the natural environment. Most research appears to indicate that this generalization will not occur automatically, even when skilled behavior has been established during training (cf. Hersen, Eisler, & Miller, 1974; Kazdin, 1974; McFall & Lillesand, 1971; McFall & Marston, 1970). This means that clinical social-skills training interventions cannot simply terminate when clients have become proficient in exhibiting the goal skill during their behavior rehearsal or practice interactions. A number of additional sessions after the skills-training phase has ended are needed to encourage, plan, or \"program\" generalization of the improved skills into actual troublesome situations within the natural environment. Techniques for fostering generalization once training has progressed will be discussed later in this chapter. Finally, there has been no empirical research on the optimum spacing interval between training sessions within an intervention. While some studies have reported training sessions held daily or even twice daily (Monti, Curran, Corriveau, DeLancey, & Hagerman, 1980; Monti, Fink, Norman, Curran, Hayes, & Caldwell, 1979), other interventions have successfully conducted sessions on a weekly basis (Falloon, Lindley, McDonald, & Marks, 1977; Linehan, Goldfried, & Goldfried, 1979; Ollendick & Hersen, 1979). The interval between training sessions is often determined by practical constraints, including the frequency that a client can attend sessions, the therapist\\'s client caseload, and other factors. One therapeutic requirement that does dictate inter-session spacing is for sessions to be sufficiently frequent that clients do not forget previously trained components or demonstrate a performance decrement on a component from one session to the next. Because this training intervention model requires that clients successively \"add\" new behavioral components onto those that they have already mastered, it is important that performance does not diminish between sessions due to overly long intervals. One might expect that any inter-session period longer than one week would exert a deleterious influence on training; more frequent sessions appear desirable. 68 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions Is it possible to accelerate a skills-training intervention by targeting several different behavioral components of the desired goal skill in each session? Once again, there has been little empirical data on how rapidly one can cover various skill components and whether it is possible to consolidate several different components in the same session without \"overloading\" clients with too much new information. In general, it would appear desirable to \"add\" new behavioral components slowly, focusing attention on no more than one per session, or devoting several training sessions to any single component if the client has not fully mastered it. Even behaviors that seem very clear-cut and easy to exhibit, such as eye contact, speech loudness, asking a partner questions, and so on, are easy only once they have been well-established in an individual\\'s repertoire. It is important to remember that if some element of a client\\'s social behavior has been absent for a considerable period of time, the highest probability response is that the client will continue to exhibit behavioral deficits, almost \"from habit.\" Covering components too rapidly or attempting to consolidate training on several components within a single session may serve to confuse clients and lead to inconsistent performance of the targeted behaviors during in-session practice. Again, theaim oftrainingistoestablishdurablechangeintheclient\\'s skills repertoire, not transitory improvement exhibited only in a single session. It is far preferable to include additional training sessions for any component behaviors that prove difficult and thereby increase the duration of an intervention, rather than proceed so quickly that new behaviors never become ftrmly established or consistently exhibited in client practice performance. Introducing the Skills-Training Intervention to Clients One of the benefits of social-skills training intervention is that the treatment directly addresses, in a manner clear and understandable to clients, the actual interpersonal problems that have been reported or observed. Once a client is made aware that various emotional or social problems (isolation, lack of friends, inability to be offered ajob after interviews, depression, social anxiety, and so on) can be a consequence of having inadequate skills to handle the troublesome situations, it usually makes a great deal of sense to the client that one way to handle situations better is to actually practice them in therapy. Before preliminary behavioral-assessment sessions take place, clients can be told that the purpose of the assessment role-plays or contrived interactions is to permit the therapist to observe exactly how the client handles sample troublesome situations and thereby determine the type of training that will be needed. When clients are asked to monitor difficult situations by maintaining a selfmonitoring diary, they can be told that they are doing this to provide the therapist with an accurate and detailed account of day-to-day interpersonal situations that create difficulty. Similarly, when the training intervention is about to be instituted, the client can and should be informed about the treatment Social-Skills Intervention Procedures 69 approach: the therapist will provide specific behavioral suggestions on how the client can come across more effectively to others and, in each session, the client will be asked to actively practice using the new behaviors. The notion of \"building\" new skills or ways to handle difficult situations by adding one \"step\" (or component) at a time can be introduced, so the client understands the nature of the entire training intervention. While many people find this explanation reasonable and high in commonsense appeal, the therapist or counselor must also recognize that social-skills training is different than traditional verbal therapy, and may not be the form of treatment that some clients expect. Because social-skills training requires active participation and positive expectancies by the client, additional rationales for the intervention might be provided. For example, the therapist can introduce training by pointing out how individuals can overcome discomfort inasituation byrepeatedlypracticingit, notingthesuperiority ofbehavioral practice of social skills beyond simply talking about interpersonal difficulties, and discussing the manner in which persons can achieve new confidence by seeing that they can now effectively handle those interpersonal situations that might have earlier caused them unhappiness or anxiety. Finally, while clients are told that they willieam and practice new ways of handling interpersonal situations in the training session, they should be made aware that benefit will ultimately be derived when they begin to use these skills in the natural environment and that this important aspect of training will also receive attention later in the intervention. However, before one can use a new skill in the natural environment, one must first learn it in the training environment. The Social-Skills Training Session for Individually Treated Clients Earlier, the learning theory principles of instruction, modeling, overt practice (or behavior rehearsal), reinforcement, and feedback were described as the \"active ingredients\" within any skills-training session. Although the behavioral components to which these principles are applied change over the course of an intervention, the training techniques within any session remain relatively constant. We will now consider how the therapist can incorporate these techniques in sessions with an individually treated client; modifications for group social-skills training will be discussed later. Instructions, Coaching, and the Provision of a Rationale The social-skills training session begins with a discussion, initiated by the therapist, on the component-behavior that will receive attention in that session. In this introduction, it is important for the therapist to clearly define the 70 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions intended target behavior and to provide several illustrations of it. For example, in a date-initiation training session, one behavioral component might be for a male client to learn to elicit information from a female partner as he would in a casual meeting that might lead to a date.\" At the beginning of the session, the client could be told that one way to exhibit this component is to ask the partner open-ended questions that will \"invite\" the partner to talk about her interests, hobbies, activities, background, and so on. The therapist might then present several examples of these kinds of questions (\"Where is your hometown?\"; \"What do you like to do in your spare time?\"; \"What kind of music do you like?\"; and so on) and then ask the client to generate his own examples of the targeted verbal component behavior. Once it has become apparent that the client understands the behavior that will receive attention in the training session, it is useful to discuss reasons why the behavior is beneficial or appropriate to exhibit. This discussion might suggest rationales, including the idea that asking questions enables one to learn more about someone else, permits one to learn of areas of compatibility or mutual interest, \"breaks the ice\" during a conversation, conveys to another person that one is interested in knowing him or her better, and probably flatters the other person, because most people seem to enjoy having the opportunity to talk about themselves. The client might be asked how he has felt when another person demonstrated his or her interest in him by asking questions to learn more about his interests and background. Whenever possible, the client should be encouraged to identify reasons why a behavioral skill-component is desirable or useful to exhibit; when a client can cite the benefits associated with a certain mode of response, the behavior may have greater salience than if the client is simply told by the therapist that it is desirable to exhibit the behavior. However, if the individual appears not to understand the reasons for incorporating a specific behavior in future interactions, the therapist can prompt this recognition by pointing out the potential benefits associated with using a given component. Identifying, discussing, and citing examples of the target component should occur at the start of every skills-training session. The amount of session time devoted to initial instruction and discussion will depend upon the complexity of the component, as well as whether the session is the first one targeting the \"Interestingly, date-initiation training reported in the literature has often focused its attention on teaching males to initiate dates with females; less frequently have studies taught comparable skills to females so that they could initiate dates. This probably reflects traditional sexist stereotypes and biases, since it is likely that females encounter very similar problems in minimal dating. Recent data suggest that males respond quite favorably to females who initiate dating interactions using these same component skills behaviors (Muehlenhard, 1976; Muehlenhard & McFall, in press). Therefore, similar training might be considered for both males and females who seek to increase minimal dating. Social-Skills Intervention Procedures 71 behavior or if it has already received attention in a preceding session. An instruction/discussion period of between five or ten minutes is usually sufficient, since the aim of this aspect oftraining is principally to define the purpose of the session. As training progresses, it is also helpful for the therapist to use a brief period of time at the beginning of a session to review and summarize components that have been covered in earlier sessions. In the date-initiation example we are using, if the client has already received training on several componentbehaviors, thetherapist maywishtobrieflyremindtheclient ofthosebehaviors and point out that the new component will be \"added to\" any that already had been targeted. The Use of Modeling within Sessions Because social-skill models can be either live or portrayed, as in videotape modeling films, the therapist can select either one for use in training sessions, depending upon the availability of technical equipment and the nature of the skill being trained. It is also possible to combine live-modeling exposure with portrayed models. The Therapist As a Social-Skills Model Oneofthe most feasible modeling procedures isfor the therapist to demonstrate the behaviors selected for training. In its most basic form, the therapist can verbalize examples of a targeted component. Examples of this are when a therapist verbalizes sample questions a client could ask a conversational partner, assertive statements that could be made when confronted with the unreasonable behavior of another person, or sample statements made to a job interviewer to convey interest in an employment position. Nonverbal behaviors can also be modeled informally by the therapist. For example, the therapist might interact briefly with the client, first with no eye contact and then with appropriate eye contact, to demonstrate this behavior. Speech loudness and affective components can be demonstrated in similar fashion. When the therapist acts as a skill model, the client\\'s attention should be specifically directed to the behavior that is being demonstrated by the therapist, so that the client can benefit from this form of informal modeling. In other cases, the therapist can serve as a live model in a somewhat more structured fashion. H a confederate is present in the room, the confederate and therapist can model a role-play demonstration interaction with the client observing it. This approach might be used in refusal-assertion training, where the confederate plays the part of an antagonist in some situation and the therapist model demonstrates an effective assertive response, paying particular Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions attention to exhibiting clearly whatever verbal or nonverbal component is being trained in the session. The same live-modeling exposure can be used in joJ>...interview training to illustrate responses to an interviewer\\'s questions (with the confederate acting as an interviewer and the therapist as the applicant model), or in commendatory assertion-training. To demonstrate conversational or date-initiation skills, the therapist and confederate could simulate the appropriate kind ofinteraction with one another for several minutes, again with the therapist modeling the desired component-skill during the course of the modeled interaction. Compared to informal modeling, in which the therapist simply verbalizes examples of a targeted component-behavior, the more structured form of modeling offers several clinical advantages. First, the client is able to actually observe a sample interaction between the therapist and a confederate. This is likely to be more realistic than simply listening to the therapist generate examples of a component-behavior outside of the context of an actual interaction. Second, it gives the client the responsibility for closely scrutinizing someone else\\'s effective handling of a situation. Ifthe therapist models effective responses during simulations of the same situations that the client fmds troublesome and will also later practice, this can be a highly relevant technique for observational learning. Finally, live-modeling of this sort does not require a videotape apparatus or other equipment. Prior planning of the interaction to be modeled is needed to ensure that the interaction creates the opportunity for the therapist to clearly exhibit the targeted component. Portrayed (Videotape) Models When videotape recording and playing equipment are available, the therapist can construct a modeling film to show the client in each training session. In an assertion-training intervention, the film might show a socially skillful model effectively handling the unreasonable behavior of others, offering disagreeing viewpoints, or so on. Conversational and date-initiation training films can be constructed to show models interacting for some period of time and exhibiting all of the behavioral components that should be present in these types of interactions. Similarly, a joJ>...interview film could show an applicant being interviewed for a position, with the model again exhibiting all appropriate components of an effective interview. Modeling videotape films used in social-skills training need not be elaborate and expensively produced to be effective. Narration included in the film is unnecessary, since the therapist can provide any needed comments while it is being shown. The film also need not be long; five to ten minutes would be sufficient todemonstratealmostanykind ofinteraction. Themajorrequirement is that the film clearly demonstrate someone effectively handling the kind of situation that the client wishes to handle more effectively, and that the primary Social-Skills Intervention Procedures 73 model (to whom the client\\'s attention will be directed when observing the film) exhibit those skill-eomponents that will later be taught. When preparing a modeling film used in training, the therapist supervising its construction should ensure that the primary model to be filmed is familiar with the component makeup of the skill to be exhibited. The situation or situations that the film model handles should be very similar to those situations the client finds troublesome. Earlier, we spoke of characteristics that enhance the likelihood of imitative learning; these should be incorporated in the film whenever possible. Specifically, an ideally salient model will be of the same sex and race as the client, approximately of the same age, will appear likeable, and will achieve a positive outcome in the film. In the case of filmed models, as well as when a therapist models a skilled interaction in the session, it is not possible to show only a single social-skill behavior component at a time. For example, one cannot readily make a realistic film or perform a live-modeling exposure that demonstrates only eye contact or only asking questions to a conversational partner, and so on. Instead, the model observed by the client usually exhibits an \"entire\" skilled response or is seen in an interaction demonstrating all the desired components. However, because only one component will receive training at a time, it is important to specifically focus the client\\'s attention on that component whenever it occurs in the modeling exposure. Thus, if a session is targeting eye contact, the client might be instructed to observe principally,how the model looks at the partner when speaking, andtodisregardatpresentanyotheraspects ofthemodel\\'sbehavior. This will prevent clients from being \"overloaded\" in trying to attend to many different model behaviors at one time. The use of portrayed or filmed models in training sessions is desirable for several reasons. Once a film has been made, it can be repeated on a number of training session occasions and the therapist can remain confident that all behavioral components will be consistently exhibited in the modeling exposure. Filmed models who are highly similar to the client can be used; this might not be possible if the therapist serves as a model and differs from the client in sex, race, or age and then it would be necessary for the therapist to live-model if a film were not used. The need to have a confederate or second therapist present in the training session would also be reduced, since the primary therapist and confederate would not have to model live those interactions that are presented on film. Finally. if a videotape modeling film is shown, it is possible for the therapist and client to view it together. The therapist could then pause the film to draw the client\\'s attention to any relevant aspect of model behavior, ask whether the client observed a behavioral component when it occurred, or even replay parts ofthe modeling film for added emphasis. These techniques would not be readily possible ifthe client were observing the therapist modeling live. However, even when live-modeling is used, the client should afterward be 74 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions encouraged to spend several minutes discussing or describing how the model exhibited the component, how that component contributed to the model\\'s effectiveness, and so on. The Combined Use of Live and Videotape Models It is also possible to vary the method ofmodeling exposure across sessions, and to provide several kinds of modeling within each session. As an example of the latter approach, the therapist might briefly model, in a live and informal manner,examples ofthecomponentthatwillbereceivingtrainingattention. In conversational-skill training, the therapist could ask the client to watch as he verbalized sample statements conveying information about his background and hobbies. The client could then observe a modeling film showing two people having a conversation and note how the conversational models exhibited the same behavioral component when they talked with one another. Here, modeling sources are the therapist\\'s sample verbalizations and the film\\'s models. In different skills-training sessions with the same client, the method of modeling exposure can also be varied by showing a modeling videotape on some occasions; by having the therapist and confederate live-model interactions, with the client observing them on other occasions; and by having the therapist verbalize model statements that illustrate a given skill component on still other occasions. Varying the model presentation methods can avoid the possibility that a client will become bored, as might occur when the client repeatedly watched the same videotape film. Combining live-modeling by the therapist with a videotape modeling film also increases the variety of different examples of a behavioral component that can be shown, since the therapist can demonstrate different behavior samples than those shown on a single film. Let us reiterate several of the major points concerning modeling within sessions. First, the aim of any modeling exposure is to permit the client to directly observe someone else\\'s socially skillful response or to observe examples that illustrate a certain kind of component-behavior. This requires, in every session, that the therapist give examples of the targeted component andlor that the client observe a more formalized simulated interaction between the therapist and a confederate. Live-modeling of an actual interaction can be replaced by exposure to a modeling videotape showing a sample interaction. Any modeling portrayal must include the component that will be targeted for training in that day\\'s session, and clients should be told to note specifically how the component is exhibited by the model. Clients should also be encouraged to discuss afterward whether and how they observed the model\\'s use of that component. Just as the instruction/discussion segment of a training session is often relatively brief, the length of modeling exposure should not become overly long. In general, a 5-to to-minute modeling period should be sufficient in any single session. Social-Skills Intervention Procedures 75 Behavior Rehearsal or Oven Practice within Sessions To this point in the training session, the client has been told about the behavior being targeted, has observed it in someone else\\'s interactions, and has discussed its rationale. The next important step is for the client to actually exhibit the component by performing it in a practice interaction. This is an extremely important and potentially difficult task for clients, since it is often much easier to verbalize and \"know\" how to behave in an interaction than to actually perform the new behavior. There are several ways that behavior rehearsal can be incorporated in the skills-training session. One is for the client to verbalize examples to the therapist ofhow the client will use the trained component. This should then be followed by a simulated or practice interaction with some other person, such as a role-play, semistructured or unstructured interaction, that can be observed by the therapist. Verbalizing Examples Verbalizing examples of the targeted skill-component to the therapist means, quite simply, that the client will practice saying some of the statements that he or she will make during the later and more formal practice interaction. In a date-initiation training session, ifthe component behavioris eliciting conversational information from a potential date, the client might generate for the therapist a number of specific, open-ended questions that he could ask. The client rehearses those questions that will be used in the forthcoming practice interaction by saying them aloud. The therapist might introduce this part of the session by telling the client: Therapist: Today we\\'ve been talking about ways that you can get to know someone better-someone that you\\'ve just met and would like to date-by getting the other person to talk about herself. As we discussed, it\\'s good to do this for a number of reasons: You can find out what interests the other person has (and thereby learn other things you can converse about), you can discover mutual hobbies or backgrounds, you will let the other person know you are interested in her, and you\\'ll probably flatter her by letting her talk about herself. We\\'ve just watched a film that showed how one person does this-the kinds of open-ended questions he asks to find out more about someone else he would like to date. Now, I\\'d be interested in hearing some of the questions you yourself will ask a person that you\\'ve just met and would like to know better. CUent: I would ask her what kind of hobbies she has. Therapist: Good. Could you say it phrased as a question? Client: What kinds of hobbies do you have? Therapist: Great,that\\'sevenbetter.Nowspendaminutethinking ofatleast 10more questions you would ask in a conversation of this type. Client (after a pause): O.K. What is your major here at school? Have you started 76 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions studying yet for final exams? What do you like to do in your spare time? Where were you raised? What are your favorite courses? Where do you live now? What kinds of movies do you like? ... In this vignette, the therapist is requiring the client to generate and verbalize examples ofthe targeted component by actually saying them aloud. This serves several functions. It ensures that the client understands the nature of the verbal component being trained in that session and it focuses the client\\'s attention on specific examples of the component. If it appears that the client does not understand the behavior correctly, cannot think of examples, or uses inappropriate examples, the therapist can discuss the component further and \"prompt\" correct examples from the client. A potential problem that may become apparent during rehearsal involves the client\\'s directly copying or memorizing the exact verbal comments of a model who was observed earlier in the session. In some cases, directly copying an observed model\\'s verbatim comments is desirable; this might be true when the client saw a modeled example of some specific verbal behavior that the client particularly liked and wishes to incorporate. However, it is also crucial for clients to grasp the general principle being taught (such as eliciting information from a conversational partner) and to generate their own examples of that principle. This is likely to produce more durable maintenance of a skill, with greater potential for generalization to novel situations, than when a client only tries to memorize, mimic, and directly copy a model\\'s observed verbal comments. The therapist can encourage the \"personalization\" of a componentbehavior by asking the client to generate and rehearse novel examples of it. Generating examples of a target component can be used for many other kinds of verbal social-skill components. In refusal-assertion training, these might include practicing statements of opinion or requests for behavior-change from an antagonist. In conversational and date-initiation training, the client might rehearse examples of personal information statements that could be told to a partner about oneself, samples ofquestions to elicit information from a conversational partner, complimentary comments that can be directed to the partner, and so on. In job-interview training, the client could generate examples of specific questions to ask an interviewer, statements conveying information about past training or experience, statements conveying interest or enthasiasm about a prospective position, responses to very difficult questions from the interviewer, etc. When a training session targets a nonverbal-skill component (such as eye contact, speech characteristics, smiles, and so on), it may not be as feasible for the client to generate \"examples\" with the therapist, and rehearsal might then proceed directly to the more structured practice format that is described next. Social-Skills Intervention Procedures 77 Simulated or Practice Interactions It is important that clients have the opportunity to practice using a newly leamed skill-component in a simulated interpersonal practice situation within the training setting. This element oftraining extends beyondsimply verbalizing examples of a targeted behavior and requires the client to actually exhibit the new component during a structured simulation of a difficult interpersonal interaction. In Chapter 3, which discussed client assessment, several procedures for the \"in-clinic\" behavioral evaluation of social skills were described. These included using structured role-plays of troublesome situations, semistructured interactions with a confederate partner, and relatively unstructured interactions between two or more clients. Although these procedures for sampling social competency are used to assess the client\\'s social skills before an intervention takes place and help to define the nature ofthe intervention, they can also serve as the vehicle for behavioral practice during the training intervention. More specifically, it is possible to incorporate role-plays, semistructured interactions, and unstructured interactions within treatment sessions, giving the client an opportunity to exhibit the component-behavior that is receiving training attention in that session. Let us examine how this can be accomplished. Structured Role-Plays in Training Sessions We earlier noted that structured role-play forms of assessment are useful when the client is being taught to respond to the relatively structured, discrete comments of another person (such as in refusal assertion, commendatory assertion, or job-interview training). Role-playing can also serve as a useful procedure for in-session behavior rehearsal for these forms of social-skills training. In the case of refusal-assertion training, a typical session might include the treatment aspects we have already described-instruction and rationale for that day\\'s targeted component, observation of an assertion model who exhibits the component, and, possibly, client-generated examples of the behavior. At that point, the client can be presented with the opportunity to use the behavior during an actual role-play with another person. The therapist might select one of the role-play situations that had been used in the earlier assessment and that had been constructed to approximate an actual situation that the client reported to be troublesome. The role-play scene is presented to the client in the same manner as it was in the initial assessment; the therapist narrates the background description of the situation and another person, the role-play partner, delivers one or more comments to the client, each of which requires an assertive response. However, in contrast to the assessment role-plays, the client is now 78 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions specifically instructed to exhibit the targeted component during his or her assertive responses to the partner. If the session\\'s targeted component is eye contact, theclientspecificallymaintainsahighdegree ofeyecontactduringthe role-play; when other components have already been targeted in preceding sessions, the client is asked to also include those behaviors in each role-played scene. When intensive social-skills training is being conducted, the client can rehearse several different role-play scenes in each session. These scenes might be from the \"pool\" of situations that had been used in the initial role-play assessment, or they might be novel situations that the client reported as troublesome since the time that the initial assessment was conducted. The number of role-play scenes that should be practiced in any session is largely determined by the client\\'s level of performance on each scene. If the targeted component is exhibited correctly and consistently over several different role-play practice scenes in the same session, and if it is evident to both the therapist and the client that the behavior has been incorporated into the client\\'s behavioral repertoire, practice on it can terminate. Ifthe client does not exhibit the behavior consistently, comfortably, or correctly in role-plays, additional practice scenes should continue. The role of the primary therapist is observer of the client\\'s role-play interactions, just as it had been during the assessment role-plays. However, it is expanded in several ways. First, the therapist specifically evaluates whether the client is using the component-behavior that is receiving training attention in that session, as well as any components that had been trained previously. Second, following each role-play scene, the therapist provides feedback, reinforcement, or additional instruction to the client on the componentbehavior before continuing with the next scene. This feedback aspect of the therapist\\'s role will be considered in more detail shortly. In the case of job-interview training sessions, rehearsal role-plays may be somewhat longer. Practice might entail the client\\'s responses to a series of questions delivered by the role-play interviewer, either using the entire jobinterview script (as during initial assessment), or using some more abbreviated set of interview questions. Some job-interview component skills do not occur only in response to a specific interview question delivered by the partner. For example, statements conveying information about one\\'s past experience, interest statements, or job-related questions directed by the client to the interviewer can appropriately occur at various points throughout the role-play interview; therefore, clients can be instructed to use these components as often as possible throughout the entire practice interview. The therapist observing the role-play would then determine how frequently the client exhibited the target component throughout the complete practice interview. This might be by counting the frequency of occurrence for various targeted verbal behaviors, estimating the client\\'s overall percentage of eye contact, and so on. Feedback, Social-Skills Intervention Procedures reinforcement, and further instruction can then be provided to the client, and the practice interview might be repeated. As we have just described it, role-play practice in training sessions requires the presence of a third person-the practice partner-who interacts with the client. This is an ideal arrangement, since it frees the therapist to devote full attention to observation of the client\\'s responses. However, it is not always possible to locate some other person who can serve as the confederate practice partner in training sessions. In these cases, the therapist can also act as the practice partner and role-play situations with the client. For example, after narrating an assertive-training scene description, the therapist then \"changes roles\" and delivers the partner\\'s comments directly to the client, concurrently observing the adequacy of the client\\'s response. In job-interview training, the therapist can act as a role-play interviewer for the behavior-rehearsal portion of the session. Semistructured Interactions in Training Sessions Some social skills do not readily lend themselves to the structured role-play format, for either assessment or behavioral practice. Earlier, it was suggested that conversational and date-initiation situations can be better approximated using semistructured interactions in which the client converses with a partner forapredeterminedperiod oftime. Althoughtheclientandpartnerbothassume some situational role (meeting at a snack bar, being together at a party, or so on), the interaction is structured only to the extent that individuals interact as though they were in that situation, and the partner follows some general conversational \"rules\" established by the therapist to avoid partner dominance in the interaction. The same semistructured interaction format that was used in conversational ordate-initiation assessment can also be followed for behavioral practice in training sessions. The client can be seated next to the interaction partner while the therapist narrates a short description of the situation on which the interaction will be centered. The format is, once again, identical to the assessment-interaction procedure, except that the client now gives particular attention to exhibiting the behavioral component that is receiving training attention. For example, if the target behavior is \"asking conversational questions,\" the client is directed to exhibit this behavior frequently during the course of the simulted interaction with the confederate. Nonverbal components, including eye contact, speech loudness, affect, or smiles, are practiced similarly. The therapist acts as observer of the client\\'s simulated conversation with the partner, and ordinarily does not take part in the interaction. However, the therapist does evaluate the client\\'s performance with respect to the componentbehavior under attention. This could include counting the number of times that 80 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions the client correctly exhibited a specific verbal component (asked a question, made a comment to the partner conveying information about his or her own interests, explicitly asked for a date, etc.). It is also possible for the observertherapist to evaluate the presence of any nonverbal components that are receiving training attention in the session. It is most desirable if a therapist confederate partner is available to interact with the client during any practice conversations. However, when a second person is unavailable to serve as the practice confederate, the therapist can function in the role of interaction partner and actually engage in a conversation with the client. When this alternate procedure is used, the therapist has two tasks during the practice period: to serve as interaction partner and to observe and evaluate the client\\'s behavior during the interaction. At the conclusion of the simulated conversation, the therapist reviews the client\\'s performance and provides appropriate feedback, reinforcement, and any further instructions that appear indicated. Although it is desirable for clients to have several opportunities for behavioral practice within the same session, this may not always be feasible. Semistructured but extended interactions (5 to 10 minutes) with a confederate partner for behavioral practice require more time than, for example, each structured role-play used in assertive-training. In order to keep session duration within reasonable limits, and to avoid the possibility of client fatigue, it may sometimes be necessary to use only one semistructured practice interaction. On these occasions, the session would terminate with the therapist\\'s feedback and reinforcement following the practice interaction. Unstructured Interactions in Training Sessions These can be handled in similar fashion to semistructured behavioral practice. Let us assume that a conversational training intervention is being conducted with several institutionalizedclients and one aim ofthe project is to increase the everyday conversational behavior between them. Group skills-training techniques will be discussed in detail later in this chapter; let us note here that one approach for behavior-rehearsal within the training session setting would be to \"pair\" clients with one another for their practice conversations. Here, a confederate partner is not used and each client in the conversation is directed to exhibit the component behavior that is under attention in that session. For example, if eye contact is the targeted behavioral component, the therapist would instruct both conversational partners to exhibit increased eye contact with one another. The therapist would also provide general directions to the clients concerning the purpose ofthe practice interaction (trying to get to know one another better, discussing mutual interests, and so on). As the unstructured conversation itself takes place, the therapist observes the behavior of each client and evaluates the extent to which both individuals successfully utilize the Social-Skills Intervention Procedures 81 trained component throughout the interaction. At the conclusion of the conversational interval, feedback and reinforcement are once again provided to the members of the dyad. Is it possible to eliminate behavioral practice within the training-session environment and, instead, ask clients to utilize the trained skill immediately after the session concludes? For example, if the client is in a residential setting or aftercare-partial-hospitalization program, could the therapist instruct the individual to seek out and engage in a conversation with some other client in the facility and, during that interaction, particularly exhibit the component being trained? This approach is potentially useful, since behavioral practice would occur within the natural environment for which training is intended. Whether this natural environment form of behavior-rehearsal can prove effective depends on several factors. The first is whether the therapist will be in a position to closely observe the client\\'s performance in the natural-setting practice. It is essential that immediately after any practice interaction, a client receive detailed feedback from the therapist. A second consideration is whether or not the practice interaction can actually take place immediately after the format training session ends. If a client leaves a session, goes to a ward dayroom, and attempts to initiate a conversation with another client, that other client must also be willing to talk for some period of time. Otherwise, the practice interaction will not occur and the client receiving treatment may actually be sociallypunishedforattempting toinitiatethepracticeconversation. Ifnaturalenvironment behavioral practice situations are not under therapist control, their effectiveness as a practice modality may be reduced. Additionally, when a client is fITSt mastering the skills to handle a situation more effectively, he or she may still have difficulty coming across well to others. This could lead to negative reactions from others! even in situations that are intended as nonthreatening practice. It would be more desirable for the client to initially rehearse a skill under situations staged or controlled by the therapist, and seek out naturalistic opportunities for behavioral practice only when the skill has fITSt been mastered in the more controlled practiCe environment. To summarize, the aim of behavior-rehearsal or overt practice in training sessions is to provide the client with an opportunity to actually exhibit a social-skill component during an interaction with another person. The staged social interactions used in behavioral practice should correspond as closely as possible to the actual situations that a client has difficulty handling or would like to handle better. In assertion-training, practice might center on role-plays approximating troublesome situations the client has encountered, perhaps including the same role-played situations that had been used earlier for behavioral assessment. In conversational or date-initiation training, the practice situations should simulate the circumstances of actual opportunities the client has to meet other people; again, the interactions used in training sessions might 82 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions well be the same as those presented during pretreatment behavioral assessment, except that the client is now being \"equipped\" with the behaviors needed to handle those interactions more effectively. Similarly, job-interview practice entails having the client actually rehearse responses to role-play interviewer\\'s questions. The more closely that both assessment and practice situations can be made to approximate troublesome interactions in the natural environment, the more likely it is that the client will learn to handle those interactions effectively outside of training. Therapist Feedback and Reinforcement Following Client Behavior Rehearsal While behavioral practice of social skills is a necessary part of training, repeated practice alone is probably insufficient to produce behavior change for clients. In most social-skills training studies, there appears to be relatively little improvement in client performance when it is observed over repeated baseline assessment interactions (cf. Foy, Massey, Duer, Ross, & Wooten, 1979; Frederiksen, Jenkins, Foy, & Eisler, 1976), confmning that practice alone is unlikely to produce improved skills. The treatment aspects reviewed to this point all precede client behavior-rehearsal in a session and enhance rehearsal\\'s effectiveness. Additionally, the treatment procedures that follow the rehearsal or practice period determine the success of training. These procedures include therapist-provided feedback, reinforcement, and shaping. When a client has completed a practice interaction and has attempted to exhibit an identified behavioral component, the therapist observing the interaction should immediately provide performance feedback to the client. Characteristics of effective verbal feedback provided by a therapist are immediacy, specificity, presentation emphasizing positive aspects of the client\\'s perfortn-ance, and the provision ofcorrective information, if it is needed. The therapist should provide a client with performance feedback as soon as possible following any behavioral practice; it is unlikely that a client will substantially benefit, for example, from feedback provided on practice that had occurred in a training session from the preceding week. Instead, feedback on rehearsal performance should occur in the same session. When several brief role-plays constitute practice, feedback should follow each. Ifonly one practice interaction occurs in a session, feedback should follow it. As we noted in Chapter 2, verbal feedback should always be \"attached\" to specific observed aspects of the client\\'s behavior in the practice interaction. Beyond simply telling a client that he or she did \"well\" during a practice interaction, the therapist should point out what the client did well, citing specific examples of how the client appropriately exhibited the behaviors targeted for attention in that practice. It is often useful to provide the client with Social-Skills Intervention Procedures 83 information on the degree of change the therapist has noted in behavioral practice. Ifa client made eye contact only about 10% of the time in as~ssment, but increases it to about 50% in the frrst training session on that component, this can be directly pointed out to the client. The greater the detail or specificity of feedback, the more likely a client will be to understand how performance was improved; this enhances the likelihood that the target behavior will be more durably incorporated in the individual\\'s skills repertoire. Feedback should, in most cases, be limited to the component-behavior being trained in that session, as well as to any behaviors that have already been taught in preceding sessions. A therapist would not ordinarily comment on an aspect of the client\\'s practice performance until it has become the target of training. However, because behavioral components are to be successively \"added\" across sessions, it is appropriate for the trainer to provide feedback on all components that have received attention to that point. This is particularly important if a previously trained behavior appears to be \"dropping off\\' in practice after it had been established and exhibited earlier. Feedback can be provided verbally by the therapist in a highly satisfactory manner. However, ifvideotaping equipment is available in the training setting, it is possible to videotape the client\\'s behavior during the rehearsal or practice period and then to play back the mm for the client\\'s self-observation when the therapist reviews the performance. This form of direct self-observationmediated feedback has been utilized in date-initiation training (see Melnick, 1973) and job-interview training (Barbee & Keil, 1973; Furman et al., 1979) to show clients elements of their practice performance immediately after it has occurred. The use of videotape self-observation also permits the client to critique his or her own performance and, if the tape replay is stopped at appropriate times, the client can practice generating alternative responses. In these ways, feedback that includes videotape self-observation is a useful training technique if suitable equipment is available. When feedback provides positive recognition of some aspect of a client\\'s practice performance, it probably operates as a positive social reinforcer. Assuming that therapist praise does function as an effective reinforcer for a given client, it will serve to strengthen the probability that the individual will continue to exhibit the behavior being praised. This raises the issue of how to provide post-practice feedback when a client does not demonstrate noticeable improvement on a behavior that had just been trained. When a new behavior is being initially acquired, it often does not show immediate, high-level improvement on the frrst trial or practice attempt. Instead, performance often improves more gradually, yielding what would be plotted as a slowly ascending curve across practice sessions. Therefore, a number of sessions may be needed to train more difficult behavioral skill-components. Exceptions to this pattern are \"one-trial\" learning, in which performance shows dramatic improvement after 84 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions one training session. This would be expected for relatively clear-cut and discrete behaviors (e.g., those responses that can be performed quickly following modeling exposure), or behavioral components that the client already had previously learned but simply did not exhibit until specifically instructed to do so. When a client fails to appropriately exhibit a trained component during behavioral practice, or fails to exhibit it at rates higher than in sessions before it had been trained, feedback still begins with the therapist citing some positive aspects of the client\\'s performance (occasions when the component was observed, albeit infrequently, by the therapist; commendation of the client for attempting to use the behavior, even if the attempt was unsuccessful; and so on). Post-rehearsal feedback provided by the therapist always should first focus onsomethingtheclientdidwell, ifitwasonlycontinuingtorehearseasituation that was very difficult. However, attention should then be turned to the component-behavior that remained deficient in practice. The therapist might attempt to ascertain why the client did not exhibit the behavior: Was it forgotten? Did the client have difficulty thinking of examples of the component, such as might be the case in conversational questions or other verbal skills? Was the client uncertain when in the practice interaction to exhibit the behavior and, therefore, did not perform it at all? Did the client feel uncomfortable or awkward making certain verbal comments or engaging in nonverbal acts? All of these are plausible reasons why a client may fail to exhibit some aspect of a socially skilled response, especially when the component is a new addition to the individual\\'s behavioral repertoire. Feedback might then lead to additional instruction from the therapist, as well as training that includes further rationales for the target behavior, examples presented by the therapist, examples generated by the client to the therapist, and so on. Iftime permits, another opportunity to practice or rehearse the interpersonal situation (through a roleplay or other interaction) should be provided. When the client continues to have difficulty exhibiting a component during practice interactions, it may be useful for the therapist who observes the rehearsal to intercede in the practice by \"prompting\" correct responses from the client. In an extremely difficult case, the therapist might be seated near the client while the client is interacting with a partner. The therapist could then prompt responses by whispering suggestions to the client while the client interacts with the partner. These might include reminders (\"Be sure to talk loud enough\"; \"Keep up your eye contact\") or suggested statements (\"Ask where he goes to school\"; \"Tell her something about your hobbies now\"). In later practice sessions, therapist prompts should be gradually withdrawn as the client becomes able to exhibit the correct behaviors without them. Finally, the therapist must remain cognizant of the appropriateness of client style or flow of interaction, especially during later stages of the intervention whenanumber ofbehaviorshavealreadybeentaught. Asdescribedearlier,the Social-Skills Intervention Procedures 85 manner in which components are integrated is important. If the therapist finds that a client is exhibiting the correct verbal or nonverbal behaviors but in an inappropriate manner, feedback and instruction should be given. Examples of such misapplications include a client \"shotgunning\" questions or other comments to the practice partner all at one time, talking too loud when speech had previously been overly soft, gesturing excessively or at incorrect times, or maintaining too much eye contact. In general, issues dealing with the integration or style of responses might be introduced in training after the basic components have been mastered. To summarize, the conduct of a training session includes four treatment steps: (1) identification, instruction, and rationale for that day\\'s target component; (2) modeling exposure; (3) rehearsal or overt practice with a partner; and (4) feedback, reinforcement, and additional instruction following the practice interaction. While the intervention progresses from one skill component to the next, the basic training format of any given session remains relatively consistent. By the conclusion of treat~nt, all requisite components will have been mastered and the client\\'s overall handling of the practice interactions should be considered skillfuL Training for Generalization of Skill Enhancement to the Natural Environment One of the most critical aspects of any skills-training intervention is bringing about generalization of skill improvement to the natural environment. This issue is certainly not unique to social-skills training, since generalization or carryoverofeffects from therapy sessions to relevant situationsinthe extratherapy environment is a requirement for any treatment program, regardless of its orientation. There are a number of clinical techniques and procedures that can facilitate generalization across time (follow-up maintenance of skill improvement), across setting (from the training environment to the natural environment), and across specific situations (so the client can effectively handle situations differentthan thoseusedinpractice, butwhichrequirethe same typeofsocialskill). Attention to generalization of training effects should be intensified toward the conclusion of an intervention when the client is already making skilled responses during in-session practice. If clients are strongly encouraged to approach difficult situations in the natural environment before they have been able to master effective responses for handling those situations, they may encounter further punishment and lack of success, and become frustrated. It is important to reiterate that an applied training intervention does not terminate when clients have become proficient in all components of their behavioral practice. Treatment concludes when the client has been able to generalize new 86 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions skills to critical situations in the environment. This often means including a number of additional sessions, even after the formal training period ends, to focus on generalization enhancement. Let us review several procedures that can help bring about generalization. Presentation of Novel Practice Situations in Training Sessions During behavior-rehearsal in training sessions, clients practice their responses aroundcertaininterpersonal situations. However,theaim oftrainingistoteach clients how to handle not only those situations that are actually practiced in training, but any situation that requires the same skilled response. For example, will a previously unassertive client be able to make assertive responses to situations somewhat different than those actually practiced and mastered in training? One procedure for evaluating this is to present the client with novel practice situations. Novelty can be achieved in assertion role-plays by varying the narrated scene description to provide different background circumstances for the practice interaction, by varying the role-play partner with whom the client interacts, or by varying the role-play comments made by the partner to the client. In other forms of skills-training, novel stimuli or practice situations can also be incorporated in later phases of training. In job-interview-training role-plays, the client might be presented with novel questions to which he or she must respond. Different role-play interviewers can be used to approximate different styles of interacting (a pleasant interviewer, a more abrupt interviewer, one who asks many questions or few questions). The sex ofthe interviewer might be varied. In conversational or date-initiation training, different practice partners can also be used. The therapist, by observing how these practice variations are handled, will be in a position to know whether the client is able to apply newly developed skills under stimulus conditions somewhat different from those that were usually presented in training-session practice. Although this will require the primary therapist to locate additional practice partners or construct slightly different sample interactions for rehearsal, the therapist will also be able to feel more confident that the client can generalize new skills to these novel situations. If deficits are noted in the novel situation performance, \"brush-up\" training is indicated. \"Booster\" or Follow-Up Training Sessions Following the conclusion of a training intervention, it is often useful to provide periodic \"booster\" sessions to ensure that social-skill gains are maintained. This can be accomplished by presenting the client with practice interactions in Social-Skills Intervention Procedures 87 follow-up sessions. The fonnat of follow-up interactions could be similar to those used in the intervention (role-plays, semistructered interactions, etc.), presenting both novel and fonneriy practiced situations. The therapist observing the follow-up practice can provide feedback and additional training on any skill aspects that have diminished and appear to require it. Follow-up or booster sessions might be planned for various time intervals after completion of the primary intervention (e.g., each month). They are especially important if the client has bad little opportunity to use the newly developed skills in the natural environment or continues to report difficulty handling in-vivo situations that should have benefited from training. Focusing Client Attention on Natural Environment Situations Where Newly Acquired Skills Can Be Used It is important that clients be explicitly made aware that the purpose of social-skills training is to improve the way they handle interpersonal situations outside of treatment. One way to draw attention to this is by asking clients to describe opportunities they have to use their new skills in genuine interactions and to increasingly place themselves in those situations, even if they had previously avoided them. In the case of skills that facilitate the development of relationships or serve similar purposes (including conversational, jobinterview, dating, and commendatory-assertion skills), the therapist and client can discuss specific occasions of when and where the client might interact with others to \"try out\" the new behaviors. When, in the individual\\'s day-to-day life, can the person meet others to engage them in conversation, interact with people who might be potential dates, or go on job interviews? Are there currently existing opportunities to enter into these social situations that the client may not be perceiving, or perceives but has not acted upon? Or, alternatively, will it be necessary to work with the client to increasingly \"place\" him or her in natural settings where there will be more frequent opportunities to meet other people? If an individual has acquired new conversational skills, but spends almost all of his or her time alone, it will be necessary to assist that client in spending more time near others before those skills can be used. This aspect of treatment might include discussion of such possibilities as a client\\'s greater involvement in hobby groups, social clubs, church social activities, neighborhood activities, or attendanceatparties. Discussion oftheseactivitiescouldalsobefollowedwith \"homework\" assignments to gradually increase the client\\'s level of participation in them. When attention is focused on using new skills in the natural environment, it is desirable to ask that the client self-monitor interactions where the skill could have been used, as well as how the client actually handled the situation. This technique is similar to the selfmonitoring diary that was kept in the initial 88 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions assessment phase, but, rather than recording only the circumstances oftroublesome interpersonal situations, the client is now also detailing more successful attempts to handle interactions effectively. Clients can be encouraged to write down brief comments each day describing any situations in which they had an opportunity to use their skill, the location where the interaction took place, how they behaved and whether they felt they exhibited the trained components, and what outcome was achieved. By making the client more cognizant ofenvironmental opportunities to use newly trained skills, and by asking the client to attend explicity to his or her own behavior in those interactions, it is possible to increase the \"connection\" between training practice and the natural environment. Therapist Reinforcement When Clients Report Skill Usage As the client brings to the session information about in-vivo situations in which the newly learned skill could have been used and describes how those situations were actually handled, the therapist will have an opportunity to verbally reinforce any client-reported attempts to exhibit the skill. For example, a previously date-anxious individual might tell the therapist about a situation in which a heterosocial interaction was attempted. The therapist should inquire to determine how the client behaved and, specifically, whether trained skillcomponents were attempted or used. The client can be specifically and directly commended for any efforts to use newly trained skills in situations that were formerly troublesome. It is important for several reasons that the therapist strongly and consistently reinforce client reports of social-skill attempts towards the end of the training intervention. This is likely to be a time when the client is still uncertain concerning his or her performance in the natural setting, and it is helpful for the therapist to assure the client that new skills can be used in that environment. Additionally, early social-skill attempts may not always be successful. The newly assertive person may find that others do not respond well to this behavior; the formerly date-anxious person may not get dates immediately after training; the previously shy individual may not develop friendships as a result of early conversational attempts. Thus, there is often a period of time when the new skill is not consistently reinforced in the in-vivo setting. Because new behaviors are maintained best when each attempt is reinforced, the therapist can provide reinforcement to counter the failures most clients will periodically experience in their early attempts at socially skilled functioning in difficult situations. If a client reports encountering a situation that was not handled well, it would be useful for the therapist to provide review, practice, and otherwise \"brush up\" on strategies to use, should a similar interaction recur. When the individual receiving skills-training is in some setting where he or Social-Skills Intervention Procedures 89 she can be observed by the therapist or other treatment staff, it is often possible to reinforce the client\\'s skill behavior directly, rather than simply reinforcing the client\\'s reports of behavior. For example, if institutionalized patients are taught more effective conversational skills, those residential staff who are in a position to observe the patients\\' everyday social interactions can be told what behaviorsthepatientshavelearnedandareattemptingtouse. Thestaffcanthen note whenever a patient exhibits those conversational behaviors. either during informal interactions with other patients or with staff, and can direct specific praise to the individual for exhibiting them. Once again, the aim is to intensify and make more consistent the reinforcement consequences for socially skilled behavior in the natural environment. Finally, the client\\'s own capacity for self-reinforcement should not be overlooked. Many socially deficient persons seem to develop a pattern of habitually criticizing and punishing themselves for their perceived or actual shortcomings in social interactions (\"Why didn\\'t I speak up just then?\"; \"I wanted to go over and talk to her, but I waited too long and missed the chance\"; \"I really handled that badly\"; and so on). In addition to the therapist or staff praising a client\\'s use of more effective social skills, the client should also be instructed to praise himself or herself when new skills are attempted in the natural environment. Further, self-reinforcement following skill use should occurregardless ofwhetherapositiveoutcomewasactuallyachieved, sincethe client is to be commended for applying the skill and cannot entirely control how another person in the interaction will respond. Thus, when a previously unassertive woman expresses her opinions in a meeting, she should praise herself afterward, whether or not her suggestions were actually adopted; when the formerly date-anxious individual initiates a heterosocial interaction, that initiation should be self-reinforced, even if the other person declined the date request. Cognitive Strategies for Decreasing Behavioral Inhibition Cognitively mediated inhibitions often prevent clients from exhibiting social behaviors that they, in fact, know how to perform. Persons may suppress even appropriate assertive responses, fearing negative evaluations from others, the possibility of being disliked, or believing that their opinions are unimportant. Individuals may suppress the initiation of social interactions such as dates or conversations because they believe themselves to be uninteresting and unattractive, or because of fears of rejection. The basic model underlying most skills-training interventions is that these cognitive fears and detrimental attributions follow past failure to handle situations well; by equipping clients with more effective social behaviors, the cognitions will also change. This often appears to be the case. However, in many instances, it is also important to 90 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions . incorporate cognitive modification techniques within treatment. Ifclients have learned to master practice interactions but seem unable to handle similar in-vivo situations, or if they report anticipatory fears, evaluative anxieties, and inhibition associated with the in-vivo interactions, cognitive modification should be considered. Repeated behavioral practice in training sessions, when accompanied by therapist feedback that stresses positive change in the client\\'s practice performance, serves to increase confidence. The therapist can also use other cognitively oriented techniques that will particularly enhance generalization. Clients might be asked to verbally identify with the therapist, and actually list all the positive consequences associated with using their new skills in the natural environment. For example, an individual who has completed refusal-assertion training could be asked to identify the benefits ofhandling situations assertively: being able to express your own views; showing others that you have opinions; behaving more forcefully and changing inequities in the way some people might otherwise act towards you; not feeling exploited or taken advantage of; being noticed; influencing others\\' decisions; coming across as a leader; and so on. As much as possible, the client should be encouraged to actively identify those benefits, with the therapist assisting and guiding the discussion. At the same time, there are certain \"risks\" that clients probably feel and that should also be discussed. No matter how appropriate, reasonable, and nonhostile an assertive response is, some people will not like an assertive individual; this may be particularly true when the assertive person is a female (Kelly, Kern, Kirkley, Patterson, & Keane, 1980). The individual who is attempting to initiate dates will not always be successful and may be rejected even when he or she makes highly appropriate approach responses. The person who has developed effective conversational skills will encounter people who simply do not want to reciprocate conversation, and even the skilled job interviewee will not always be offered ajob. Many clients who have previously been skills-deficient remain oversensitive to the possibility and significance of such negative outcomes, and discussion of these issues is important in later phases of training. The therapist might assist the client in \"weighing\" the many benefits associated with the use ofnew social skills in relevant situations against thepossibilities of occasional rejection, not being liked by everyone, and so on. The cognitiveoriented techniques advocated by Ellis (see Ellis, 1962; Ellis & Grieger, 1977) may be useful in reducing excessive worries and evaluative social anxiety toward the end of the skills-training intervention. It is also possible to teach clients to directly modify their own negative or anxiety-maintaining cognitions, particularly when these cognitions occur before a client enters a social interaction and when they might otherwise lead the client to avoid that situation or perform poorly in it. An example of negative Social-Skills Intervention Procedures 91 cognitions is the job applicant who has leamed effective interview skills but still experiences great anticipatory anxiety and many failure-related thoughts before an interview. Another case is the individual who has leamed appropriate social-interaction skills in training, but worries excessively prior to initiating a conversation or a date request in the natural environment. Meichenbaum and his colleagues (Meichenbaum, 1977; Meichenbaum & Cameron, 1974) have demonstrated the clinical utility of identifying the fear-related self-statements in which the client engages prior to the critical in-vivo situation. This can be accomplished by asking the client what he or she thinks about, worries about, or fears as the critical situation is approached. If the individual is unable to report specific examples ofthese self-statements, it may be necessary to ask the client to closely attend to his or her own thinking during some in-vivo interactions and record the self-statements that were noted. These self-monitoring records or notes can be brought to the next session and reviewed with the therapist. The client can then be taught to modify anxiety-related cognitions. As outlined by Meichenbaum (1977), an individual must first learn to identify when negative cognitions or self-statements begin to occur in the natural environment. It would appear likely this might be at the time the client realizes a difficult situation is forthcoming, when the client first decides to enter into the interaction, or as the interaction is approached or initiated. As soon as the client is able to detect or recognize the existence of potentially detrimental statements, or as soon as anticipatory anxiety is noted, the client begins generating positive, success-oriented, andanxiety-reducing self-statementsinplace ofthe negative cognitions. Thus, the individual is taught to cognitively relabel situations and describe them in less-threatening terms, to generate positive anticipations of performance, and to focus on the potential for beneficial social outcomes. It is not sufficient to simply admonish a client to \"think positively\" when approaching difficult situations. Time in later training sessions must be spent teaching the client to identify potentially detrimental cognitions or selfstatements. Then, attention in sessions can be given to assisting the client in actually practicing, by overt verbalization, new and more positive selfstatements. Examples of such statements might include, depending on the nature oftraining and of the client\\'s current maladaptive cognitions: \"Just stay calm\"; \"I\\'ve got a lot of interesting things I can tell this person\"; \"I\\'m going to speakclearly and will be understood\"; \"It\\'s really going to be fun for me to meet this person\"; \"I\\'m going to handle this well\"; etc. The client might practice generating a number of positive self-statements aloud in the session, with the therapist listening and providing reinforcement. However, it will be necessary for the client to leam to think them covertly before an in-vivo situation, rather 92 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions than say them aloud. Therefore, after the client has practiced saying a list of effective anxiety-reducing or performance-facilitating statements, the therapist can ask the client to fade out saying them aloud and practice thinking them, by saying each in thought. The final, and most important step, is for the client to actually use these new and more positive cognitive self-statements when approaching potentially difficult social interactions in the natural environment. In essence, modification of one\\'s own thoughts is itself a skill that can be practiced in training and then applied in genuine interactions, just as behavioral social skills are frrst practiced and then used in-vivo. The treatment approach of cognitive modification has been detailed by Meichenbaum (1977) and appears to be a very useful component in social-skills training, especially with respect to enhancing the generalization of training to the natural environment by decreasing cognitively mediated behavioral inhibition. However, it is crucial that clients have first learned more adaptive social-skill behavior; if the individual lacks the objective skill behaviors in his or her repertoire to handle an interpersonal situation effectively, it is unlikely that the person will be able to actually achieve positive social outcomes, and new self-statements will be insufficient to produce enduring behavior change. To summarize the issue of generalization, it is probably unwarranted for a therapist to simply assume that once clients have learned new social skills in the training setting, clients will then \"automatically\" use them in the natural environment. As a training intervention is being planned, an important preliminary step to ensure the environmental relevance of training is to construct behavioral-assessment situations that closely approximate the actual situations a client would like to handle more effectively. Further, training and behavioralpractice situations should also be \"tailored\" to the exact interactions that the client finds troublesome or difficult to handle. As the intervention concludes, and as we then want the client to actually use new skills in the natural environment, additional treatment steps are needed. These include: follow-up or booster practice sessions; presentation of novel practice situations to ensure that the individual can handle interactions similar to (but not identical with) those that had already been practiced; focusing client attention on actual opportunities in the natural environment when the use of their new skills would be appropriate; reinforcing client efforts to use new skills in those in-vivo situations; and utilizing cognitive modification approaches to decrease behavioral inhibition. In most instances, treatment attention to generalization should occur after the client has begun to master the goal social-skill in practice; it is important that the individual be equipped with the behavioral abilities to handle difficult situations well before being placed in those situations. Sessions focusing on generalization enhancement can often conclude the skills-training intervention with the individually treated client. 93 Social-Skills Intervention Procedures The Social-Skills Training Group There are several reasons why a therapist might wish to conduct a social-skills training group, rather than working with just a single individual. One of the foremost is cost and time-effectiveness. As we will see, social-skills group interventions often require little more time than single-client treatment, both in session length and in the duration of the entire intervention. Thus, a group of clients can be treated with only slightly greater expenditure of therapist time than is needed for one client. In addition, because a number of clients will be present for each session, clients can often serve as behavioral practice partners for one another, reducing the need for therapist confederates to function as partners in role-plays, semistructured interactions, and so on. Many of the learning principles for social-skills training may operate even better in a group environment than in single<lient treatment clients can serve as live skillmodels for one another during sessions; they can provide feedback, reinforcement, and suggestions to one another, rather than the therapist\\'s always having to do this; and clients\\' discussions with one another can provide mutual support and encouragement. Finally, because training is conducted in a group setting, the session itself is a social interaction or event; this may serve a useful function for many isolated or socially anxious individuals. One major requirement for group-administered training is that there exist a number of clients with similar social-skill deficits, all of whom could benefit from the same type of intervention. Thus, training could be conducted with a group of unassertive persons, a group of date-anxious individuals, or with a number of clients who can benefit from comparable training in conversational skills. However, this also raises one of the limitations of group-administered training: When training is conducted in a group, an individual with highly unique social-skills training needs, or an individual who responds to training much more slowly than the others in the group, may not be able to derive as much benefit from treatment oriented towards the group\\'s pace as from an intervention tailored specifically for that individual client. However, because of its efficiency in applied settings, as well as the peer-mediated treatment influences made possible in a group, this format of skills-training is often desirable and practical. There has been very little empirical attention given to the ideal size or client composition for a skills-training group. A number of investigators have reported successful interventions with client groups ranging in size from three to twelve (see Kelly, Urey, & Patterson, 1980; Hersen, Kazdin, Bellack, & Turner, 1979). One limiting factor on the uppermost number of clients in the group involves the time needed for behavioral practice in sessions. As we will see, it is often possible to have the group break up into practice pairs during the 94 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions behavior-rehearsal portion of each training session. If this practice fonnat is used, clients can rehearse or practice their skills simultaneously with one another, and it is not necessary to have each client practice individually and successively. This reduces the session\\'s length. However, there still must be sufficient time in the group itself for each client to verbalize personal examples of the targeted behavioral component, comment on the behavior of a model, and discuss the rationale for specific skill behaviors. Ifthe skills-training group is too large, there will either be insufficient time for each client\\'s active participation in the session, or sessions will need to be very long. An optimal size group, in this light, might consist of four to eight clients. With respect to client composition of the skills-training group, it would appear desirable not only for all members to have similar types of skills deficits (such as assertiveness, date-initiation, and job-interview), but also to be approximately comparable in the degree of skill deficiency. It is neither practical nor essential to require that all clients exhibit deficits on the same behavioral components of the goal skill; it does seem desirable for all members to be approximately comparable in their extent of social-skill impairment, overall functioning level, and probable response to training. Ifclients differ from one another too greatly on these kinds ofcriteria, it may be difficult for the therapist to conduct and pace the group such that all clients benefit from training. For example, let us assume that one client can master each component on the very fIrSt occasion that it is targeted for attention, while all other clients require much more repeated practice and training. Iftraining is paced for the slower clients, the highest-functioning clients may become bored; conversely, lowfunctioning participants would derive little benefit from a group geared to the advanced clients\\' more rapid skill-acquisition level. To some degree, variability in skill-acquisition rate will always occur and can be handled by assigning special roles to the more advanced clients, such as being live models or providers of feedback to slower-paced clients during sessions. However, relatively initial homogeneity of client pretraining skill level appears to be desirable in most cases. Just as an ideal format for individual client social-skills training involves ongoing, multiple-treatment sessions, the same format is useful for groupadministered interventions. Following behavioral assessment of each client\\'s social competency, group training-sessions can successively and cumulatively directattentiontoeach ofthe behavioral components that togethercomprisethe final goal social skill. By moving from one component behavior to the next overthecourse oftheintervention, thedesiredskillwillhavebeensuccessively shaped in each client at the end of training. The number of group sessions needed for the entire training intervention again depends on the complexity of thegoal skill(particularly, the number ofdifferentcomponentsthatcompriseit and that will need to be taught), as well as clients\\' functioning level and the time Social-Skills Intervention Procedures 95 required for them to master each component. Then, just as in single-client interventions, treatment attention can be directed more intensively to increasing generalization of each client\\'s skill-improvement to the natural environment. Behavioral Assessment Preceding the Training Intervention Just as it is important for behavioral social-skills assessment to precede an individual client\\'s training intervention, it is useful to assess each group member\\'s skills before group training itself begins. The purpose of assessment remains the same: to pinpoint those behavioral components of an effective skill response that are deficient and require training attention. When an individual client is treated, performance in pretreatment assessment interaction determines the exact components that will later receive training. In the case of a group of clients, it is unlikely that all members will exhibit deficits on the same components. However, each client\\'s performance during individual sample interactions still provides important data on training needs. For example, in a job-interview training intervention with five persons, we might observe and rate the performance of each during a pretraining job-interview assessment role-play. The therapist may find that all of the clients exhibit adequate eye contact with their interview partner, that none of the five conveys very much specific information about past experience to the interviewer, and that two of the five ask the interviewer a number of appropriate questions but three do not. The therapist could then conclude that, of these three component behaviors, eye contact will probably not require any training attention, a good deal of session time will be needed to teach clients to convey appropriate information about their work or educational experience, and asking job-related questions of an interviewer will require some attention in training sessions, so that the several clients deficient in asking questions can learn to do so. The behavioral components of the goal skill targeted during this intervention, then, will be those in which any group member is deficient, with the greatest attention being focused on the behaviors with which most ofthe group\\'s clients have difficulty. The client-assessment procedures for a group social-skills training intervention are similar to those used with individually treated clients, as described in Chapter 3. It is often useful to meet with the group on several occasions for the purpose of identifying specific examples of troublesome situations for each client. For example, in a refusal-assertion training group, one female client may report difficulty asserting herself with male co-workers in the office setting. A second client may also experience assertiveness difficulties, but principally in the context of social relationships with neighbors and family members. A third client may have trouble expressing personal opinions in work conferences and meetings. Thus, while all have trouble asserting themselves, 96 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions the situations in which this deficit manifests itself are different for each. The aim of one or more preliminary group discussion sessions might be for each client to generate descriptions of a number of specific problematic situations that he or she has encountered. The therapist conducting the session takes notes of these descriptions and uses the infonnation to later construct role-play assessment scenes, just as scenes would be constructed from the situation reports of an individually treated client. When individualized scenes have been constructed for each client, that group member would then role-play his or her own scenes for behavioral-assessment purposes, as well as for practice in subsequent training. If group members have difficulty generating detailed examples of situations they find troublesome, the self-monitoring diary recording procedure can be used by clients, and daily infonnation on troublesome situations can be brought to the therapist at the time of the next session. From this infonnation, additional personalized role-play scenes for each client can be constructed by the therapist. In some cases, it may not be necessary to develop different and unique assessment sample-interactions for each client. For example, in ajob-interview training group thatconsists ofclients who will be seeking similartypes orlevels of work (all high school graduates, all college graduates, all persons seeking labor employment), the therapist may be able to construct a single interview question script that will be used for the assessment interview ofeach participant (cf. Hollandsworth et aI., 1977; Kelly, Laughlin, Claiborne, & Patterson, 1979). This would be justified if it appears likely that all clients will face similar questions in their genuine job interviews. In heterosocial or conversational assessment, the same interaction fonnat can be used to assess the skill of each client (e.g., an 8-minute semistructured or unstructured interaction); only the background narrative description preceding it need be tailored to the individual client\\'s situation. Thus, in assessment interactions preceding a group heterosocial-skills-training project, a client who is a student might be told to imagine that she is interacting with another student at a campus dance, while a heterosocially deficient individual who has opportunities to meet others at a local bar might be told to imagine that the assessment interaction is taking place at that setting. However, the actual sample interaction will be identical for the two clients. When social-skills assessment is being conducted with an individually treated client, it is often necessary to use a therapist confederate to serve as the partner in the client\\'s sample interactions. This can also be done in group interventions. For example, one of the early group meetings can be devoted to behavioral assessments, and the therapist can tell the group that each member will be engaging in his or her sample interactions on that day. Then, the therapist can escort clients to separate locations for their individual assessment interactions. These locations can be offices, areas of the clinic, or even Social-Skills Intervention Procedures 97 different parts of a large room. Each client then meets his or her partner and engages in the assessment interaction apart from the other clients. In assertivetraining, each client-partner dyad might be role-playing the individual scenes that had been identified as problematic for that client. In job-interview training, each client might be role-playing a standard job interview with the partner. In conversational or date-initiation training, each client would interact with his or her partner for some predetermined period of time. Thus, while training will later be conducted in a group, each client is assessed in individual sample interactions with a confederate partner; there could be as many assessment interactions taking place at one time as there are clients in the group or partners who can serve as interaction confederates. For the evaluations to provide useful treatment information. the therapist wholeads thegroupmustobtainspecificinformationoneachclient\\'sperformance in the assessment interactions. This includes information on how adequately each client exhibits the goal skill\\'s component-behaviors during the sample interactions. Ifthe number of clients who are being assessed is sufficiently small, the therapist may be able to circulate and observe each clientpartner interaction pairto evaluateeach person\\'s performance on those component-behaviors that comprise an effective social skill. Whenever one or more clients are observed to exhibit deficits in a skill component, that component can be noted so that it will later be targeted in group training sessions. Alternatively, if the therapist cannot directly observe all clients in their assessment interactions, audiotape recordings can be made of each client-partner pair and later they Can be evaluated by the therapist to determine training needs. A final performance-rating strategy is for the confederates to function both as interaction partners and as raters of the client\\'s skill behavior. This requires that the partners be given information on the specific behavioral components that they are to observe. Each partner can then report information to the therapist on the exact behavior of the client with whom he or she was paired during the sample interactions, and the therapist can in turn target those components for later training. For this to be effective, the partners must receive some training on identifying the component-behaviors they will be expected to rate. This might include estimating the quality of client nonverbal behaviors such as eye contact, loudness, or affect; using rating scales; and determining the presence or frequency with which verbal components are exhibited by the client. A practical problem involves the availability of confederates who can serve as partners for each client. Even a small training group consisting of, perhaps, five clients requires five other persons, who can also serve as partners. It is possible to reduce this support staff by conducting clients\\' assessment interactions at different times and \"reusing\" the same partners for several clients. However, another approach that is less costly in staff time is to have clients serve as interaction partners with one another. Let us consider how this Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions approachofpairing clients with one another for their sample interactions might be used in several types of skills-training. Assertive-training. All clients who will be in the training group can be assigned into pairs or \"buddies.\" During the assessment role-plays, one memberofeachdyadcanfirstplaythepart oftheantagonist. Thesituationsthatwill be role-played are those that the client who is being assessed reports as troublesome. A script for each role-play scene is prepared in advance by the therapist; the client who will play the antagonist directs comments from a role-play script to the client who is being assessed. The client being assessed, in turn, responds to the partner\\'s comments while the therapist observes and evaluates the quality of the assertive responses. This system functions in exactly the same manner as do assertive role-plays with a therapist confederate, except that another client serves as the partner. When all the first client\\'s role-play scenes have been completed, the two clients reverse roles. They then role-play the scenes for the other member of the dyad. Job-interview training. Clients again can be assigned into role-play pairs. Here, one member ofthepaircanplaythepart ofajobinterviewerandfollowa written script of questions to ask the client, who is playing the role of the employment applicant. When they have fmished the role-play interview, the two clients reverse roles, with the former applicant acting as interviewer and following the same interview script. Conversational-skills training. A similar procedure can be used with the two members ofeach pair, directed by the therapist to interact with one another for a set period of time. Depending upon the assessment aims, the conversational interaction can be semistructured or unstructured. Ifit is semistructured, the \"partner\" member of the dyad can follow certain conversational rules established by the therapist, just as the therapist confederate partner would. These might include not monopolizing the conversation (by asking a question only ifasked one by the other client), never talking for more than 20 consecutive seconds, remaining noncontingently warm, allowing the other person to \"break\" all silences, and so on. Ifthe interaction is intended to be unstructured, neither client would be given instructions other than to talk for some period of time, to get to know one another better, etc. Once again, the assessment procedures are identical to those when a confederate partner is used, except that here another client serves as the interaction partner. Using clients as partners for one another\\'s assessment interactions presents practical advantages when other staff are unavailable to serve as interaction partners. However, it is necessary to explain to clients how they are to behave in the sample interactions, particularly when one client plays the structured role of a partnera role-play antagonist, a job interviewer, for example. It also remains necessary for the therapist to closely scrutinize the skill performance of each client during his or her interactions to assess areas ofdeficit. However, as Social-Skills Intervention Procedures 99 we will see, utilizing clients as partners with one another can be helpful not only in pretraining assessment, but also for behavioral practice or rehearsal when training begins. Group Training Sessions Social-skills group training sessions utilize the same learning principles as does individual training. Instruction and rationale for that day\\'s targeted componentskill behavior, modeling, rehearsal or practice, and reinforcement and feedback are always incorporated in the group session. Let us consider how these principles are modified for group-administered training. Instruction, Coaching, and Provision of Rationale Individual client skills-training sessions begin with the therapist identifying that day\\'s target component, providing examples of it, and discussing reasons for the importance of the behaviors. In a skills-training group, a similar procedure can be followed, except that the discussion also involves input and comment from all group members. The therapist can solicit from the group members their opinions about why a particular behavior is an important part of the goal skill, and ask how each client would feel when interacting with another person who exhibited that behavior (or did not exhibit it). In addition to providing clear examples and instruction on the behavior, the group leader encourages clients to verbalize rationales for its importance. Modeling Exposure in the Skills-Training Group In the training of individual clients, modeling can be accomplished when the therapist informally verbalizes examples of the target behavior, models an interaction live before the client and exhibits the behavior, or shows a modeling film in which skilled models can be observed by the client. These procedures are applicable in the skills-training group as well. It is also possible for clients to function as social-skill models for other clients in the group session. One way for this to occur is by having a relatively proficient group member verbalize examples of a target component during the group session and thereby be observed by the other clients. In a conversationalskills group, a session might be focusing on the behavioral component of self-disclosing appropriate information about oneself in conversations. The therapist could ask one client to explain what specific things he might tell a conversational partner about himself. The client then verbalizes specific information he would convey in a conversation, perhaps concerning his hobbies, interests, where he went to school, his favorite television shows, music that he 100 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions likes, and so on. As the client lists these self-disclosure topics, the other clients will be benefitting from his modeled examples. In turn, the therapist can ask other clients to verbally generate their own examples of the target behavior, again providing a live-modeling experience for others in the group. Thus, one client\\'s rehearsal or practice serves as a modeling source for the other clients who observe it. Client practice and modeling may also be combined by having clients actually rehearse an interaction in the presence of other group members. For example, in a job-interview training group, a client might be asked to play the part of an applicant during a role-play interview in front of the group; the client would be instructed to particularly exhibit whatever behavior is receiving attention in that day\\'s session. The interviewer in the role-play can be either a therapist or another client. As the client practices the interaction, that client will be benefitting from behavior rehearsal of the skill; as other clients observe the role-play and see the behavioral component exhibited, they will be benefitting from another modeling influence. Similar client-modeling can be incorporated in other types of skills-training groups by having selected clients role-play assertiveresponses, briefconversations, ordate-initiationstylesinthepresence of the other members. Client-modeling is a useful adjunct source of imitative learning in socialskills training groups. However, even if the therapist always selects a client who is felt likely to be a good skill model, that client may not exhibit the targeted behavior in its most correct, clear form. For that reason, the group leader may wish to combine several modeling sources within the same session. The therapist might first verbalize examples of the behavior, then live-model a short interaction demonstrating its use in a social context or show a modeling videotape, and only then ask one of the more proficient group members to rehearse an interaction that demonstrates the behavior, while the other clients observe the practice. Rehearsal, Feedback, and Reinforcement in the Skills-Training Group Practicing sample interactions before the group affords the opportunity for behavior rehearsal and for modeling; it is also possible for the other clients, who just observed the \"model\" client, to provide performance feedback to their peer. After the in-group practice, the therapist can ask various members of the group to comment and offer feedback on the adequacy of the client practice they watched. Just as when feedback and reinforcement are provided by the therapist, other clients should be encouraged to: (I) comment specifically on the behavioral component(s) that have already been targeted for training, and not comment on yet-untrained aspects of the performance; (2) always provide positive or commendatory feedback first on what their peer did well; (3) make Social-Skills Intervention Procedures 101 any corrective feedback comments concerning the component-behavior\\'s exhibition that are warranted; and (4) offer specific instruction or suggestions, if they are needed. In essence, the therapist teaches clients to provide specific, constructive behavioral feedback and reinforcement of the other client\\'s practice or rehearsal performance in the session. If it was evident that a client\\'s in-group rehearsal was inadequate, the group leader should have the client repeat it again before the other group members until it becomes more effective and the target component reaches proficient levels. At that point, a different client can practice a simulated interaction in front of the group, providing still another modeling exposure source for the other clients and an opportunity for more client-administered feedback, reinforcement, or suggestions. This can rotate among all group members, or as many clients as session-time permits. Finally, depending on the nature of training and the amount of behavior rehearsal that the therapist wishes to incorporate in the session, the group can be broken up to permit clients further individual practice opportunity. Iftherapist confederate partners are available, each client might be assigned to his or her partner and asked to practice a sample interaction with that partner. This practice is identical to that used in the pre-intervention behavioral assessment, except that each client is now asked to particularly exhibit the trained behavioral component during the practice. If confederate partners are unavailable, clients can be paired with one another for skill rehearsal, again in the same manner that was described earlier in this chapter. The group leader\\'s role is to determine how adequately each client or client-pair engages in the component during individual behavior rehearsal; perhaps the leader can do this by circulating among the dyads and observing client performance. An even more efficient procedure is to break the group up into practice triads. Here, two clients engage in the practice interaction, while the third serves as a \"surrogate trainer\" and offers feedback, reinforcement, and suggestions following their practice. The members of the triad then change roles, so that each has the opportunity to practice, be a practice partner, and be an observer-trainer. Ifit is evident after practice that clients have not yet mastered the behavior, the next group session will need to give itstill more attention. When most clients are able to exhibit the component consistently and successfully in their rehearsal, the subsequent group session can focus attention on the next behavioral skill-component to be trained in the intervention. As group sessions move from one component to the next, clients\\' overall performance ofthegoal skillwillbe successivelyimproving. By the conclusion of formal training sessions, each client should have mastered the skill and should be demonstrating effective performance in all practice interactions. When clients have demonstrated improvement in their handling of practice interactions, treatment can then focus on skills-generalization to the natural environment. All of the techniques described earlier for fostering generaliza102 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions tion are applicable in the skills-training group. Clients can be exposed to novel rehearsal interactions by varying the partners (confederates or other clients) with whom they interact, the exact situations that are practiced, and so on. Clients might be asked to self-monitor significant daily interactions that occur between group sessions; group time can be spent discussing each participant\\'s reports of in-vivo situations where the newly acquired skills were used. While the therapist actively reinforces such reports of skill usage, it is even more powerful for clients to actively praise, encourage, and offer suggestions to one another. As group members discuss situations where they successfully used appropriate social skills in the natural environment, their successful reports serve as a modeling influence on other persons in the group. Finally, cognitive modification procedures, including the identification of negative cognitions, thepractice ofovertandthen covertpositive self-statements regarding performance in social interactions, and other cognitive restructuring techniques, are all useful in group social-skills treatment. The treatment techniques reviewed in this chapter represent suggested training procedures. Depending upon the setting in which training is conducted, the staff and equipment resources, and the nature of the dient population, the therapist in an applied setting may find it necessary to modify some of the procedures, or to evolve techniques or treatment emphases other than those described here. Perhaps the two most important questions that should always guide the skills-training practitioner are, first, whether a given training technique represents a logical application of learning principles and, second, whether the training intervention is effective. The question of intervention effectiveness and evaluation will be considered in Chapter 5. With respect to the first issue, it is evident that there are many different ways to incorporate learning-theory principles into training sessions. For example, modeling can be accomplished using a number of different procedures: therapist verbalizations of examples of a component behavior; therapist live-modeling of a simulated interaction; modeling videotapes; client practice that serves as a model for other clients; and so on. The important point is that any of these techniques can be used to represent the incorporation of imitative learning principles in the session. Similarly, whatever formats are used for instruction, discussion and rationale presentation, behavioral practice or rehearsal, and feedback/reinforcement, itappears essentialthatsomeapplication ofeachoftheseprinciples occur in every session. Social-Skills Training in a Workshop-Format Intervention There may be occasions when a practitioner is called upon to conduct some form of social-skills training in a workshop-like format. By this, we mean that training is to be conducted with a group of participants in one or perhaps two Social-Skills Intervention Procedures 103 extended sessions lasting at least several hours. Training is therefore groupadministered, but does not take place in multiple, ongoing sessions and must be concentrated in a much more brief period of time. From almost all perspectives, this is not an ideal method for teaching social skills to any clinical population of interpersonally deficient persons. When training is compressed into a single, long session, it is extremely difficult to provide adequate attention to individual component-behaviors of the goal skill, to provide sufficient opportunities for behavioral practice, or to give adequate individual attention to those persons who require it. Similarly, techniques that foster the generalization of training from the workshop setting to critical events in the natural environment can be incorporated in only cursory fashion, since it would usually not be possible to have periodic but regular contact with clients to monitor whether they are using the new skills, to reinforce reported skill usage in the natural environment, to deal with cognitive inhibitions adequately. and so on. This means that workshop-format training is almost certainly unsuitable to teach general assertion skills, conversational skills, date-initiation skills, or job-interview skills to persons with substantial deficits in these competencies. When a therapist is asked to conduct workshop-format or single-session social-skills training for almost any clinical population, one of the best initial strategies might be to convince the requesting party of the need for multiple, ongoing session training. Then, the intervention would become much more a social-skills training group, permitting sufficient time for thorough training and generalization attention. However, under certain circumstances, concentrated workshop-format training can be useful. These circumstances might occur when: (1) the persons to receive training are relatively high-functioning under most circumstances and are not a \"clinical\" population in the usual sense; (2) training is intended to assist them in better handling very specific situations in the environment; and (3) a longer multiple-session intervention cannot be undertaken. An instance when a one-to two-session, workshop-format training project might be useful is training to enhance the ability ofgraduating high school or college stude~ts to successfully handle job interviews (cf. Hollandsworth et al., 1977; Hollandsworth & Sandifer, 1979). Here, the clients who receive training are likely to be relatively high-functioning and able to derive some benefit from even a brief intervention. In contrast, it appears unlikely that more seriously skills-deficient clients, such as formerly hospitalized psychiatric patients, vocational rehabilitation clients, or the chronically unemployed, could benefit from a workshop in interview training. Instead, they would require more intensive training in this area. A similar example is workshop-format social-skills training to increase the ability of high-functioning persons to handle very specific work-related situations. A group of hospital nurses might be provided with workshop training for the appropriate handling of unreasonable demands from patients; 104 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions factory supervisors could be given training in commendatory or refusal skills for use with their employees; retail-store salespersons might be provided with social-skills workshop training to assist them in approaching potential customers; and so on. Again, each of these applications is characterized by a relatively specific intended use of the goal skill, and the recipients of training presumably are not seriously skillsdeficient, but instead wish to further enhance their behavior in a specific situation. The major task of the group leader who conducts a workshop-format intervention is to incorporate basic treatment principles into a much shorter period of time. The leader who conducts the session first must objectively define the end-product goal skill, identifying those behavioral components that comprise an effective handling of the target situation. If the purpose of the workshop-type intervention is to teach a specialized application of one of the goal skills we have already discussed (e.g., job-interview training for employment-seeking students, or assertiveness for supervisory employees), skill components such as those outlined in Chapter 3 and the later specializedskills chapters are probably relevant. On the other hand, if the workshop is intended to target some other, perhaps unusual, kind of social skill (such as the social skills needed for salespersons to effectively approach potential customers), it will be necessary for the therapist to first investigate what behaviors constitute an effective example of that skill. When the trainer has determined the specific verbal and nonverbal behaviors comprising the goal skill, the aim of the workshop will be the same as any other form of social-skills training: to teach the participants to exhibit those components in their behavior within the targeted situations. One aspect of a social-skills training intervention that may have to be eliminated or curtailed due to time constraints is pretraining, individualized behavioral assessment of each participant. If training is to be conducted in a single and extended session, it may simply not be possible to have each client role-play individual assessment interactions or otherwise participate in an observed-behavior sample assessment. This creates a situation of uncertainty for the workshop leader, since the leader will be unaware of which behavioral components are missing in most clients\\' baseline performance and, therefore, which behavioral components of the goal skill will require training. Ifit is ever necessary for the therapist to eliminate or curtail pretraining behavioral assessment of each client, it is probably best for the therapist to assume that at least some clients will be deficient in each component that makes up the goal skill. Consequently, training attention in the workshop focuses on all components of the skill, with greatest attention and time devoted to those components deemed most critical to effective handling of the interpersonal situation in question. When planning the workshop intervention itself, the therapist will wish to Social-Skills Intervention Procedures 105 incorporate the same learning principles that characterize any other kind of social-skills training. One way to do this is to conceptualize the session in tenns of time segments, and to assign attention to several of the behavioral components in each time segment. Let us consider a possible training format for a workshop intended to teach effective interview skills to job-seeking students who will soon be graduating from school. Let\\'s further assume that the workshop is large, with 50 participants, and is conducted in a relatively short single session (2 to 3 hours), to illustrate how these principles can be used under nonoptimal conditions. The session might begin with the leader identifying the purpose of the workshop and listing all the interview components that will receive training that day. The leader could then \"group\" the components into several categories. One might be \"talking about oneself\\'; it might include such separate component behaviors as conveying detailed information about work experience, conveying information about education or training background, and conveying information about more personal interests, hobbies, and so on. A second category could be \"sounding interested\"; it might include the behaviors of asking relevant questions to one\\'s interviewer, making statements that convey interest in the position, and so on. A final component category might be \"nonverbal style\"; it might include eye contact, posture, affect, and speech characteristics. This categorization procedure consolidates many different components, which could not be individually trained in a short period of time, into a more manageable set of three behavior classes. The first time-period of the workshop can focus explicitly on one set of behaviors, with the second periodoftimedevotedtothenextcategory, andsoon. Inessence, acategory of components in this workshop is being treated as a single component would be treated in a more intensive, ongoing intervention. Within each time-segment, the therapist can apply learning principles to the entire set of behaviors being targeted in that segment. For example, the leader mightlist, identify, andinstructthegroupineach ofthe separatebehaviorsthat make up the fltSt category. This includes providing examples of statements conveying detailed information about one\\'s work experience, education, and interests; instructing the participants in ways to answer interviewer questions on these matters, or in how to spontaneously offer this information to the interviewer even ifit is not specifically requested; focusing on reasons why it is important to convey these kinds of information in an interview; and so on. This part of the workshop corresponds to the provisions of the instruction/rationale portion of the social-skills training sessions discussed previously. Next, the leader provides modeling exposure for the participants, using either a live-model interview or a videotape modeling film of an ideal interview. Clients are asked to note how the model exhibits not just a single 106 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions behavioral component, but each of the components in the category receiving attention in that portion ofthe workshop. Other modeling techniques described earlier might also be incorporated at this point of the session. Behaviorrehearsal mustalsobe included inworkshoptrainingto permiteach participant the opportunity to practice the category of components being targeted at that time. Since it is improbable that a single session-leader or even several leaders can observe or interact with all clients in a large workshop, participants might be grouped in threes for behavior rehearsal. As we discussed earlier, one member of each triad can serve as interviewer in a role-play job interview, following a list of standard interview questions from a written script provided by the therapist. A second person can act as the applicant; it will be this client whois actually practicing the skill behavior. The third member ofthe triad can function as observer ofthe role-play and provide feedback, reinforcement, or suggestions to the role-play applicant following the practice interview. Members of the triad rotate roles during the rehearsal phase, perhaps with the therapist circulating among all triads to join in the practice observation and judge when most clients have mastered the category of behaviors under attention. When this phase of the workshop session is completed, the leader can reconvene the entire group and move on to the next category of components, training these in the same way as the ftrst category (with instruction/rationale, modeling, breaking the group down for triad rehearsal with feedback, and so on). The reader may note that this procedure is not fundamentally different from the individual and group training models described previously. All involve training identified behavioral components of the goal skill in cumulative fashion and all involve the application of the same learning principles to accomplish this aim. Workshop-format training does so in a more consolidated, compressed fashion, often with relatively less attention given to the assessment of each individual client. Whenever possible, workshop interventions should also include attention to skills generalization, since the requirement that clients generalize their skills to the natural setting is as important here as in any other form of social-skills training. To summarize, accelerating skills-training into one or two sessions, although time-efficient, has limited utility. It is not a training method of choice for enhancing the interpersonal repertoire of most skills-deficient persons such as clinical populations, mental health center clients, unassertive persons, extremely shy and socially anxious individuals, or those needing individualized training. It may be a suitable format for teaching very situationally specific skills to high-functioning groups when more ongoing and intensive training cannot feasibly be conducted. Chapter 5 Assessing the Effect of Social-Skills Interventions The 19808 have been termed \"the decade of the empirical clinician\" (Association for the Advancement ofBehaviorTherapy, 1980). In part, this designation points out the need for therapists to objectively assess the effectiveness oftheir treatment interventions. Certainly, most behavioral practitioners who conduct social-skillstraining areinterestedinempiricallyscrutinizingthe impact ofthis training. However, there has often been a schism between the research literature on a treatment method, which includes very heavy reliance on experimental control and precise measurement, and clinical applications of the same treatment, under conditions where there may be only minimal attention to objective evaluation. There are a number of practical reasons why empirical, controlled treatment assessment is made difficult in applied or direct-service settings. These may include the policies of the setting, which often stress service-provision but do not have clinical research as an agency priority; an absence ofthe staff support or staff time needed to carefully evaluate treatment effectiveness; a lack ofclients to serve as members of a control group for group treatment evaluation; and setting policies that prohibit the assignment of any client to a control or comparison group. For these as well as other reasons, therapists in applied settings often come to think of any systematic treatment evaluation as research, and of research as something that they cannot do. On the other hand, virtually no practitioner consistently utilizes any form of treatment in the absence of information at least suggesting that the treatment works. In its most basic form, a data source upon which most therapists rely is client verbal self-report. Ifa client reports difficulty in some life area early in treatment, but then in later treatment reports that those difficulties have abated, the therapist is using one data source, client verbal reports, pretreatment and posttreatment to infer that behavior change has occurred. The therapist often further infers that the intervening treatment was responsible for client reports of improvement, and the therapist\\'s own use of the treatment technique is reinforced by the reported improvement in client functioning. This sort of 107 108 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions rudimentary, casual treatment evaluation is used by virtually all practitioners, regardless of orientation, during the course of their applied interventions. Unfortunately, there are a large number of limiting factors associated with casual treatment evaluations. For example, the data source is limited to the client\\'s subjective reports, which may not be behaviorally accurate and are very susceptible to bias. If, indeed, improvement has occurred, it may be due to events other than treatment that interceded between the early and late client reports (Campbell & Stanley, 1963). There are a wide range of more objective methods for assessing the impact of a social-skills training intervention, either with a single client or with a group of clients. The choice oftreatment evaluation method depends largely on the aims of the therapist. In some instances, a therapist may simply be interested in answering the question: \"Is my client now better in handling interpersonal situations than he or she was before the intervention?\" In other instances, the therapist may wish to elaborate this question to answer both whether the client is more interpersonally skilled following an intervention and whether this improvement is definitely the result of the training intervention itself. Either of these evaluation questions can be dealt with in an objective fashion in any social-skills training project, often without the need for extensive expenditures of staff time, equipment, or special resources. In addition, treatment assessment procedures are available that can permit a therapist to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of individual or group social-skills training without the need for untreated control groups. In this chapter, we will consider two major topics relevant to evaluating the effectiveness of social-skills training: measures or sources of data that convey objective information on client social functioning, and methods for interpreting these data to answer treatment evaluation questions. In all cases, it will be assumed that training occurs in an applied setting, and the interventionassessment procedures to be described will be those that can most feasibly be incorporated in applied training. Measures from Which the Outcome of the Training Intervention Can Be Determined In any form of treatment-effectiveness evaluation, it is necessary to assess the quality of client social behavior on multiple occasions. As we will see later in this chapter, one of the simplest, although least rigorous, assessment methods is simply to compare clients\\' pretraining social-skill behavior with their social effectiveness subsequent to training. In other intervention-assessment designs, social-skill measures are taken at different points during the intervention period. However, regardless of the kind of intervention evaluation and its rigor Assessing the Effect of Social-Skills Interventions 109 or stringency, it is always necessary to obtain measures of the client\\'s socialskill behavior at various points in time. If the therapist can establish that client change indicative of more effective social-skill functioning has occurred, the therapist will be in a positionto know conclusively that the client\\'s interpersonal skill repertoire has been enhanced. A number of data sources can provide the therapist with important information on change in client social skills as a result of treatment. These include: (1) objective ratings of client performance during sample interactions in the training setting; (2) global ratings of overall social competence during sample interactions; (3) paper-and-pencil self-report inventories completed by the client, which describe his or her comfort and behavior during social interactions; (4) detailed self-monitoring information provided by the client on social behavior outside the therapy setting; and (5) direct observation of the effectiveness of client social behavior in the natural environment. The reader may note that a number of these measures were discussed earlier in Chapter 3, when we consideredinitial assessment ofthe skills-deficientclient. This isbecause many of the same measures used in pretraining client assessment can be repeated at later times to evaluate the client\\'s response to the intervention package. Let us now consider each of these measures and how they can be used to evaluate client response to a training intervention. Objective Ratings of Client Performance During Sample Interactions in the Training Setting Behavioral assessment of a client\\'s social skills during role-plays of troublesome situations and during semistructured or unstructured sample interactions was suggested earlier as a desirable clinical method for evaluating specific deficits in the way a client interacts with other people. The purpose of initial or pretraining assessment was to identify behavioral skill-components that the client failed to exhibit, or failed to exhibit appropriately, during the observed sample interactions. Further, the role of the therapist was to rate the client\\'s performance in these sample interactions, and to specifically and objectively evaluate the degree to which the client exhibited each behavioral component that contributes to an effective, skilled response. One direct way to assess the impact of the training intervention is to repeat the same sample interactions at later times, and to thereby determine whether the client now exhibits those behaviors that had previously been deficient. Utilizing client performance in contrived or sample interactions requires that several conditions be met. The assessment situations used later in the intervention must be comparable to those used before the intervention began in order for client skill-change to be meaningfully evaluated. For example, ifeight roleplay scenes are used during initial pretraining client assessment, the therapist 110 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions will want to use the same role-play scenes, or scenes comparable to those initially used, for later assessment. Ifclient behavior during a semistructured 5-minute conversation is used during the initial assessment phase, the same interaction format would be undertaken later to evaluate change in conversational skills. A second requirement for using client simulated-interaction performance as a dependent measure to assess an intervention\\'s effect is that the same behavioralcomponents beobjectively measuredoneachoccasionthatthe interaction is evaluated. This can be accomplished by rating the client\\'s interactions for the presence or frequency of each behavioral component; rating forms such as those presented in Chapter 3 and in Chapters 6-10 are suitable for this purpose. If the therapist rates a baseline (or pretreatment) assessment interaction on eight component behaviors, and later in the intervention rates client performance in comparable interactions on the same eight components, it is possible to objectively identify change on any of them. For example, the therapist would be able to report that on one occasion, a client made eye contact with the partner approximately 10% of his speaking time. By rating the same component in a later interaction, the therapist could determine that eye contact was now 80%. In an initial assessment ofjob-interview role-play, the therapist might find that a skills-deficient client made three statements conveying information about her work background to the interviewer partner; when the same role-play interview is repeated later, fourteen such statements might be tallied over the course of the interaction. A similar behavior-change analysis can be conducted on virtually any other social-skill component, provided it can be rated from the client\\'s performance. It is often unnecessary to plan special and extra times when client performance in sample interactions will be conducted to obtain this information. One very feasible way to incorporate objective evaluation of skills competency into an ongoing intervention is by rating client performance during the behaviorrehearsal orpractice interactionsthat are already apart ofeach training session. Evaluatingclient use ofbehavioral skill-componentsduring client \"in-session\" rehearsal has been an approach widely used in the social-skills training research literature. For example, Frederiksen, Jenkins, Foy, and Eisler (1976) taught appropriate assertion skills to two individually treated psychiatric patients who were deficient in this capability. In each training session, clients received instruction, modeling exposure, feedback, and reinforcement in a manner similar to that outlined in Chapter 4. The form of behavior-rehearsal used in each session was having the client role-play assertive responses with a confederate, who played the part of an antagonist; a group of the same role-play scenes were used in all sessions. By objectively rating the client\\'s practice performance each day on all component behaviors under study. Frederiksen et al. were able to objectively determine that the client improved on such comAssessing the Effect of Social-Skills Interventions 111 ponents as eye contact, making appropriate behavior-change requests to the antagonist, and so on. Because role-play practice was an important clinical aspect of each training session, the only added \"cost\" to obtain this objective information on the intervention\\'s success was having an observer rate the client\\'s practice in each session. A similar approach has been used to obtain treatment-effectiveness data for other types of skills-training interventions. For example, Furman et al. (1979) conducted jo~interview skills-training and, as part of every session, had each client practice a standard role-play job interview. Thus, the role-play interview represented the practice or rehearsal \"ingredient\" of each training session. These investigators audiotaped the practice interviews and were then able to count the frequency that the clients exhibited each component-behavior in their practice on various occasions throughout training. Once again, the clients did nothave todoanything outofthe ordinary during the session forthe purpose of obtaining this data; all that was required was for the therapist to develop a procedure to objectively rate the client\\'s role-play job-interview performance in each session. By keeping notes, completing a component-behavior ratingform while observing the client\\'s live practice, or tape-recording the practice performance of clients during their rehearsal interactions, the therapist can combine client rehearsal with objective assessment of the quality of that rehearsal. Specific data on client behavior-change can thereby be obtained as part of the natural course of a skills-training intervention. Global Ratings of Overall Social Competence During Sample Interactions By rating a client\\'s practice during simulated role-plays and semistructured or unstructured interactions, it is possible for the therapist to objectively determine whether a client exhibits those specific, individual component behaviors that comprise a socially skilled handling of the practice interaction. At the end of an entire conversational skills-training intervention, the therapist might rate the behavior of a client during an 8-minute conversation with a partner and determine that all trained components are present in the client\\'s interaction: good eye contact (about 80%) is present, the client\\'s rated affect and frequency of smiles are relatively high, the client directs 14 appropriate conversational questions to her partner, makes 28 statements conveying appropriate personal information to the partner, and so on. All of these are much higher than they were during comparable 8-minute assessment conversations that had been conducted before training took place. Does this confirm that the client is now a skilled conversationalist, at least in the practice setting? In preceding chapters. we noted that social-skills interventions train a final desired goal skill by teaching each of the behaviors of which it is comprised. Therefore, one would expect that when a client exhibits all necessary behavior112 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions al components of that goal skill in his or her handling of an interaction, the client would be judged favorably on the global skin as well. However, this is an assumption whose validity must be empirically checked. Wolf and his colleagues (Minkin et aI., 1976; Wolf, 1978), as well as Kazdin (1977) have pointed out the importance of socially validating the outcome of behavioraltreatment interventions. One aspect of the validation process is demonstrating that when an individual engages in a set of trained behaviors, that person is then more proficient in the global or overall skill that was the original purpose of training. In essence, this aspect of evaluation seeks to relate change in specific behaviors to corresponding change in overall social impact. Without such confirmation, there is the potential risk that an intervention might change certain discrete behaviors, but leave the client fundamentally unchanged in the overall skill that was the original target for intervention. In an applied training intervention, data on the social validity of treatment can be obtained by establishing that clients are more proficient in the goal skill based upon improved global, subjective judgments of their social competency. In the assertion-training literature, investigators have often asked an observer not only to rate the occurrence or frequency of specific behavioral skillcomponents during client rehearsal, but also to evaluate how assertive the client behaved based on a global judgment. Whenever possible, this judgment should be made by someone other than the therapist, since the therapist\\'s global judgment of client overall competency in a practice interaction win likely be biased. A number of skills-training interventions have had the practice partner, with whom a client actually interacts during behavior rehearsal in sessions, rate the overall skill shown by the client during the interaction they just completed (cf. Goldsmith & McFall, 1975; Falloon, Lindley, McDonald, & MaIb, 1977; Argyle, Trower, & Bryant, 1974). These ratings can be made by asking the confederate partner to complete rating scales, such as an anchored 7-point scale, to describe the client\\'s effectiveness in the interaction. In a conversational training project, partners could be asked to rate the client\\'s overall performance (from 1 = extremely poor to7 = extremely good) on such dimensions as conversational pleasantness, ease of interaction, the amount of interest shown by the client in the partner, and overall conversational ability of the client as assessed by the partner. For other types of social skills, different appropriate global criteria can be utilized. It may be possible to have outside judges evaluate the client\\'s global performance during selected practice interactions. For example, in the Ureyet al. (1979) heterosocial-skills training project, male clients were taught how to appropriately meet and interact with unfamiliar females. To establish the social validityofthe trainingoutcome,differentfemalejudgeswereasked tolistento audiotape recordings ofeach client\\'s pretreatmentassessment interactions with the partner, as well as later posttraining conversations when clients were Assessing the Effect of Social-Skills Interventions 113 exhibiting the component behaviors that had been taught to them. The female judges who listened to the tapes were nonprofessional staff unaware of the purposeoftraining;thus, theirsubjectiveevaluations ofclientsocialskillwere unbiased and approximated the way a naive female observer might respond to the client\\'s behavior. The judges were asked to complete several global skill-evaluation questions using 7-point scales, to rate the client\\'s overall skill, the interest-value ofthe interaction, how eagerthejudgemight be toherselftalk to the male heard on the tape (who was the client), and so on. Because the judges consistently rated posttraining tapes more positively on these subjective dimensions than pretraining tapes, the investigators obtained information confirming that clients not only engaged in objective heterosocial-skill component behaviors more often after training, but that they also were seen as \"better\" conversationalists in a more global, subjective sense. A very similar global assessment procedure has been used in studies on job-interview training (Furman et al., 1979; Kelly, Laughlin, Claiborne, & Patterson, 1979; Kelly, Wildman, & BerIer, 1980). Here, tape recordings of clients\\' pretraining and posttraining role-played practice job interviews were presented to genuine personnel managers for their evaluation. The managers rated such dimensions asthecandidate\\'s(client\\'s)overallquality ofworkexperience, thevocational ambitiousness ofthe client, the enthusiasmshown bytheclientin working, and whether the manager listening to the role-play would actually hire this person based on the interview. Whenever the therapist uses outside or naive judges to evaluate global or subjective aspects of a client\\'s skill, it is of course essential that the client give permission for a person uninvolved in treatment to hear or observe the interaction, so as not to violate client confidentiality. Up to this point, we have always stressed the need for social-skills interventions to assess and train very objective, \"molecular\" behavioral components of the goal skills. Here we tum our attention back to the \"molar\" aspects of socially skilled behavior and ask whether, in a global and subjective sense, the client appears more proficient in the overall goal skill that was the target for training. If so, the social validity and applied impact of the treatment intervention will be better substantiated. Paper-and-Pencil Self-Report Inventories of Social Skill When client pretraining assessment techniques were discussed in Chapter 3, it was noted that most paper-and-pencil client self-report inventories of social skill yield only general information on the individual\\'s behavior in interpersonal situations. For example, it is essentially impossible to learn from self-report inventory scores what exact situations are troublesome for a given client or how that client objectively behaves in those situations. Thus, they are of limited utility in planning the exact social-skills training that a client will require or the 114 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions precise skill behaviors that will need to be covered in the intervention. Further, social-skill self-report inventories yield information on how the client feels in social interactions or how the client reports behaving, not on how the individual objectively acts. Forsome ofthe same reasons that self-report measures ofsocial skills do not yield extremely specific data on the training requirements of skills-deficient clients, they can be auseful ancillary datasourcefortheoverallevaluation ofan intervention. This is the case for reasons similar to those that we just discussed in the section on global, subjective evaluations of social competence. With global evaluations of interpersonal competence, a subjective judgment of the client\\'s overall handling of a practice interaction is being made by some external,observing judge-theconfederatepartner, anaiveobserver,someone naive to the treatment but \"expert\" in evaluating that social skill, such as a personnel interviewer rating role-played job interview performance, etc. When client self-report measures of social skill are administered, we are asking the client to subjectively evaluate his or her own handling of interpersonal situations. Ordinarily, self-report inventories do not require the client to detail behavior in one particular situation, but instead \"tap\" the respondent\\'s perceptions of how a certain kind of situation is usually handled or how he or she ordinarily feels in that kind of situation. It is important to note that while paper-and-pencil inventories of social skill may be scored or quantified in an objective manner, the data source is actually the client\\'s self-perception or description of his characteristic behavior. Selfreport scores may not always correspond, for example, to objective observations of component skill behaviors made by the therapist observing practice interactions or even with global, subjective judgments of social competency made by an external observer (see Mischel, 1968). However, inventories can provide the therapist with very useful, albeit generalized, data on a client\\'s cognitive evaluation or personal perception of his own typical behavior in certain types of situations, such as interactions requiring assertiveness, or social initiation. Since treatment assumes that clients\\' self-appraisals will become more positive as the result of their developing new behavioral skills and as the result of direct cognitive-modification aspects of training, this perceptual change should be reflected by more positive self-report inventory scores. A variety of social-skills self-report inventories have been developed and reported in the clinical research literature during the past several years. Table 5.1 lists some of these scales, their publication sources, and brief descriptions ofeach.Chapters6,7, and8,whichrespectivelyconcernconversational-skills training, date-initiation, and assertion-training, include reprinted copies of several of these inventories. In general, self-report inventories focus upon: (1) the respondent\\'s description of his or her current behavior in a certain kind of Assessing the Effect of Social-Skills Interventions 115 situation, such as the Wolpe-Lazarus Assertiveness Questionnaire or the Rathus Assertiveness Schedule, both of which measure reported behavior in situations where assertive responses are appropriate; or (2) reported feelings, cognitions, or fears in certain kinds of interpersonal interactions, such as the Fear of Negative Evaluations Inventory or the Social Avoidance and Distress Scale. The therapist could select scales that appear to most closely tap those dimensions of interest in the treatment invervention evaluation. Self-Monitoring of Social Behavior Data When we considered the initial client assessment that occurs in the planning stages of a social-skills training intervention, as well as the generalization programming that occurs late in treatment, the utility of client self-monitoring data was noted. Self-monitoring information differs from self-report inventory measures in several ways. First, monitoring data are more behaviorally specific; the client is asked to record and briefly describe specific social interactions that actually occur in the natural environment. These might be occasions when the client behaved assertively. (or wanted to), initiated a conversation with a member of the opposite sex (or wanted to), and so on. Usually, other specific situational information is obtained for each recorded incident, including where it occurred, who the other person was, how the client behaved or felt, and what outcome was achieved. A second difference between self-report inventories and self-monitoring data involves the manner and time-frame for which the client provides information. An inventory is completed in one sitting andtherespondentretrospectivelydescribeshowhe orsheusuallybehaves, but over a generally unspecified period of time. On the hand, the self-monitoring data are completed in an ongoing or continual manner. The individual can be asked to make entries concerning each day\\'s social situations in a selfmonitoringdiaryattheend ofthatday, orcanevenbeaskedtocarryanotepad for recording information about relevant situations immediately after they have been encountered. For these reasons, self-monitoring data are both specific in terms of the situations recorded and the time interval over which they occur. An important reason for the therapist to collect and keep client selfmonitoring records is to better assess whether the individual\\'s social interactions in the natural environment have changed over the course ofthe intervention. In some respects, this may be the single most significant measure of treatment effectiveness that can be obtained, since it provides relatively specific behavioral data from the natural environment and, except when it is possible forthe therapisttodirectlyobserveclientsocialbehavioroutside ofthetraining setting, it can be the best source ofavailable in-vivo behavior-change information. Self-monitoring data ean be analyzed in several ways, depending on the specificity of records kept by the client and the aims of the therapist. When TABLE 5.1.

For example, the therapist might find that early in treatment, a heterosocially deficient client monitored both dateinitiations and actual dates over a 2-week period. The records indicated that one date-initiation attempt took place, but no actual dates occurred. At some point late in the intervention, over a comparable 2-week period, the client brings in self-monitoring records showing that five initiations occurred and resulted in four actual dates. Thus, the therapist has obtained self-monitoring information indicative ofmore successful in-vivo dating behavior, both in terms ofdatingrelated social approaches and actual dates. Another type of self-monitoring data analysis takes into account the number ofoccasions when a trained skill was successfullyusedin proportion tothe total number of occasions when the client reported wanting to use the skill. An example of this in an assertion-training intervention is having the client record all situations when he or she wanted to behave assertively, along with a description of how each of those situations was actually handled. During a one-week period prior to or early in training, a skills-deficient client might bring in self-monitoring records showing six different times when the individual felt the need to be assertive, but no occasions when assertive responses were made (yielding a total of zero). During a comparable time interval subsequent to training, the therapist might determine from self-monitoring data that the amount of assertive responses in situations deemed by the client to require assertiveness increased to 75%. For self-monitoring data to be systematically used in treatment evaluation, the therapist must have the client bring recording forms to training sessions. This, in turn, requires that the client diligently make self-monitoring record entries on a daily basis for whatever time intervals the therapist is examining (e.g., one week before training and one week at the conclusion of formal training; for two weeks before and two weeks after the training intervention; continuously throughout the intervention). However, client record-keeping of this type can present practical difficulties. One ofthe primary problems is that self-monitoring of day-ta-day social interactions over an extended period of time can be hard for even well-motivated clients to perform. Client compliance in gathering self-monitoring information can be enhanced by providing them with forms on which to record their social interactions, by asking clients to keep only necessary details in the monitoring notes, by stressing that these records are an important part of treatment, and by directly reinforcing clients for bringing accurately completed self-monitoring forms to the session. Even with these steps taken, the therapist should be aware that self-monitoring of in-vivo social interactions is high in \"response cost\" to the client; for practical reasons it 118 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions may be necessary to limit the use of this data source to selected time phases, such as pretraining and posttraining, rather than use it continuously throughout the intervention. Self-monitoring-based data are susceptible to several forms of bias. Over time, some clients may become \"fatigued\" and devote less attention to recording the occurrence or details of in-vivo social interactions than they had early in the self-monitoring phase. This can result in their \"missing\" certain interactions that would have been recorded previously. On the other hand, clients can also become more proficient in self-monitoring critical in-vivo events as they acquire more experience in this procedure, artifactually inflating the number and nature of the entries in their records as time progresses. Additionally, altered client perception of social interactions or of their own performance in those interactions is likely to accompany social-skills training, and may bias the objective accuracy of self-monitored reports of behavior. For example, at the conclusion of training, the therapist and client devote substantial time to the discussion of in-vivo situations in which the trained skill can be applied. This treatmentattention to applicationsofthe skill, andperhaps adesire to please the therapist, could affect the client\\'s accuracy of self-monitoring. However, in spite of these limitations, data derived from client self-monitoring records may represent one of the most viable ways for the therapist to evaluate the impact and generalization of the training intervention. Direct Observation of Client Social Behavior in the Natural Environment Self-monitoring of data utilizes the client as observer of his or her own social behavior when it is impossible for the therapist or other external observer to function in this day-to-day role. When we considered client pretraining assessment methods, we noted that client social behavior in the natural environment can also be directly observed when: (1) the natural environment is observationally accessible; (2) the social interactions of interest are naturally occurring at either a high rate or on a predictable basis, so that the observer will be in a position to monitor them; (3) the staff trained to conduct such social-skill observations are available. These criteria are usually met most successfully within residential settings or schools. If it is logistically possible to conduct in-vivo behavioral observations of client social skills in the natural environment as a part of initial pretraining assessment, it should also be possible to repeat the observational methodology later to determine behavior-change in the same setting. Gutride, Goldstein, and Hunter (1973) and Jaffe and Carlson (1976) observed the social behavior of institutionalized psychiatric patients during mealtimes in the residential setting Assessing the Effect of Social-Skills Interventions 119 as an in-vivo dependent measure of training effectiveness. In these studies, trained observers evaluated the presence or abscmce of specific c9nversational skill component-behaviors during every 30-second interval (Gutride et aI., 1973) or lo-second interval (Jaffe & Carlson, 1976), while the client was seated at the dinner table with other clients. The investigators were able to associate training with increased rates of such behaviors as conversational verbal content, eye contact, forward learning, and initiations ofdialogue within the natural environment. Whenthey canbe accomplished, direct andquantified observations ofclient social behavior in the natural setting represent an ideal source ofinformation on the effectiveness of training. Provided that specific observations are reliably made by trained observers, the therapist can gain information about whether the client is actually exhibiting new skill behaviors in the intended natural environment. The in-vivo observational assessment procedures described in Chapter 3 are also applicable when using this technique as a data source for evaluating the intervention\\'s success. In addition, several other procedural points must be emphasized when in-vivo observations are repeated on multiple occasions for treatment evaluation purposes. The first involves setting or situational comparability whenever in-vivo observations are made. Ifaclient\\'s social interactions are observed in a specific setting, such as at mealtime or during on-ward free time, on one set of occasions before training occurs, any later set of observations must also be made under the sarne situational conditions. The more dissimilar the situational conditions in terms oflocation, activity, other persons present in the observational setting, time of day, and so on, from one set of observations to the next, the less will be any potential for interpreting behaviorchange across those different periods. A second important factor when conducting repeated in-vivo observations involves the client reacting to the person observing the social interactions. Let us assume that a therapist plans to observe an inpatient\\'s conversational behavior in a ward dayroom setting before, and again following, a conversational-skills training intervention, to determine any change in the nature and frequencyoftheindividual\\'sinteractions. Oneofthetherapistsispresentinthe dayroom setting each afternoon from 3:30-4:00 p.m. when the client is there, and the observer rates various behavioral components present in the client\\'s interactions during this period. The measure is obtained daily for one week before, and again one week after, the training intervention. As much as is possible, all conditions within the dayroom setting are comparable during pretraining and posttraining in-vivo assessment. However, during the posttrainingobservation phase, theclientmay noticethetherapistinonepartofthe dayroom and, because of the therapist\\'s presence alone, will be \"reminded\" to engage in the behavior. Presumably, the observer here serves as a cue for the 120 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions client to engage in the trained skills; if the observer were not present in the setting, the, client might not use the newly trained skills. In this case, the observer functions as a discriminative stimulus, and it is the observer\\'s presence in the setting that governs whether or not the individual will exhibit socially skilled behavior. This phenomenon might lead to distorted and artifactual evidence of improved posttreatment social skills. Ways to minimize this problem include surreptitious observation so that the client is unaware that he or she is being watched, or observation conducted by some person other than a therapist involved in the training procedure itself, who is therefore less likely to serve as a discriminative stimulus for skill behavior. The use of direct observation procedures in the natural environment to measure socially skilled behavior-change accompanying a treatment intervention is a highly desirable information source when these data can be feasibly collected. The reader unfamiliar with in-vivo observational rating procedures who plans to utilize such data to evaluate training may wish to consult a specialized reference source that describes direct observation methodology (see Cone & Hawkins, 1977; Hersen & Bellack, 1976; Keefe, Kopel, & Gordon, 1978). The Desirability of Multiple Measures to Evaluate Social-Skills Training Effects There is an old Indian fable concerning six blind men who came upon a strange beast which, in fact, was an elephant. Each ofthe men had heard ofelephants, but none had actually seen one. In order to understand what this large animal was like, the men approached the elephant and each one grasped part of it. The first blind man put out his hand and touched the side of the elephant. \"How smooth! An elephant is like a wall.\" The second blind man put out his hand and touched the trunk of the elephant. \"How round! An elephant is like a snake.\" The third blind man put out his hand and touched the tusk of the elephant. \"How sharp! An elephant is like a spear.\" The fourth blind man put out his hand and touched the leg of the elephant. \"How tall! The elephant is like a tree.\" The fIfth blind man reached out his hand and touched the ear of the elephant. \"How wide! An elephant is like a fan.\" The sixth blind man put out his hand and touched the tail of the elephant. \"How thin! An elephant is like a rope.\" Assessing the Effect of Social-Skills Interventions 121 Shortly, the six men began quarreling over the appearance of an elephant and attracted the attention of a wise Rajah who then spoke to them: \"The elephant is a big animal. Each man touched only one part. You must put all the parts together to find out what an elephant is like... A similar set of circumstances confronts the therapist who wants to obtain information on the effectiveness of a soCial-skills training intervention. Because any fonn of social competency is a complex phenomenon, there is no single measure from which the therapist can infer that significant behaviorchange has occurred. Objectively rating the presence of exhibited skillcomponent behaviors during a client\\'s practice interactions is desirable because of its \"molecular\" orientation; the therapist can see whether or not the client exhibits those discrete components that had been taught in the intervention. However, it is limited because it is based on behavior sampled in the training setting and also because it does not directly evaluate the global adequacy ofthe client\\'s skill. Obtaining judgments of overall client social competence during practice interactions can provide subjective, global evidence of improvement, but does not relate this to specific client social behaviors, and is still a measure based on performance in the practice setting rather than the natural environment. Self-report inventories usefully tap a client\\'s self-perception, description. and feelings about his or her social behavior, but are subject to behavioral inaccuracy and situational nonspecificity. Self-monitoring data and direct observation of client skills in the natural environment are excellent in-vivo measures, but require considerable effort on the part of the client in selfmonitoring or the treatment staff in direct observation; additionally, direct in-vivo observation procedures may be almost impossible to conduct when the client is not in a confined setting of some kind. Ideally, the therapist examining the effectiveness of an intervention will select several types of measures to use in treatment evaluation and thereby be able to detect changes in clients\\' specific behavioral repertoire during practice interactions, their global improvement in practice as evaluated by impartial observers, their inventory-based self-reports of social functioning, and im-proved skill during troublesome situations in the natural environment based on self-monitoring or observational data. To the extent that these different types of measures are incorporated in treatment evaluation and, taken together. confirm improved social skills, the therapist can be confident that the intervention was successful. Further, this confidence will be based on empirical data from-a variety of measurement sources. *FromQuigley, L. The Blind Men andthe Elep1uml. New York: Charles Scribner\\'s Sons, 1959.

Reprinted by permission. 122 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions On the other hand, it is possible that measures such as those described in this section will yield contradictory information on client improvement. This can also be quite useful, since it provides important treatment information on areas requiring further training attention that would never have been detected if careful evaluation of training effectiveness were not conducted. One set of inconsistencies might exist between objective ratings of component-behaviors present in a client\\'s practice interactions and more global, subjective evaluation ofoverall skillcompetency. Forexample, let usassumethatlateinaconversational-skills training intervention, the therapist evaluates a client\\'s 8-minute practice conversation and determines that all the component-behaviors targeted in treatment are being exhibited correctly and at reasonable rates during the interaction. The therapist might then ask an impartial observer, such as another staffperson at the centerwhere training takesplace, to evaluate an audiotapeof the client\\'s performance on more subjective criteria, in the manner described earlier in this chapter. The therapist finds that the global evaluation is not extremely positive and does not validate the proposition that the client\\'s performance reflects skilled behavior. Assuming that the judge\\'s global evaluation is reliable and nonidiosyncratic (which could be determined by having additional judges also rate the tape recording), it would suggest that some elements of the client\\'s conversational behavior still need training attention. If this occurred, the therapist might seek to determine what aspects of the conversation or what behaviors by the client led to the negative overallcompetence evaluation by the external judges. Additional training attention could then be focused upon those aspects. A.n.other type of outcome data inconsistency that might occur is between self-fDOIlkoring records or direct in-vivo observations and the client\\'s pro-flCietlCy during behavioral practice in the training setting. Ifit is apparent that the cliellt can effectively handle in-session practice interactions, but data from the Batural environment indicate that troublesome situations are still avoided or handled ineffectively, this would suggest to the therapist that more attention to geaeralization is needed. The important point in each of these examples is that careful attention to imerYention-assessment serves much more than abstract \"research\" purposes. It provides the tlterapist with empirical iriformation ofclinical importance on the success oftraining and on trouble-points that still may require additional attemioltl.. Without treatment-evaluation measures, it is unlikely that the therapist would be in a position to accurately gauge the impact of the intervention. Treatment Evaluation Designs for Applied Settings To this point, we have considered measures that can provide information on social-skill behavior. However, planning the evaluation of a training intervenAssessing the Effect of Social-Skills Interventions 123 tion involves not only selecting appropriate sources of data, but also detennining when data will be obtained. In large part, the times when social-skill data are collected determine the rigor of the treatment-evaluation design and the questions that can be answered on client behavior-change as a result of the intervention. We will now turn our attention to several treatment-evaluation designs that can be used in applied settings, both for individually treated clients and for group social-skills training interventions. There are, of course, an extremely large number ofexperimental research designs capable of analyzing the effect of social-skills training. In this chapter, only a limited number of evaluation strategies will be presented. Those discussed here will be strategies that seem most feasible within applied or direct-service settings, since that is the scope of this book. Experimental designs that require several control groups, untreated groups of clients, and treatment withdrawal or reversal procedures will not be stressed, even though they often provide superior experimental control. Treatment Evaluation Designs for Individually Treated Clients Three procedures that can be usedto evaluate the effect ofsocial-skills training with individually treated clients in most applied settings are: (1) pretraining and posttraining assessment on the same repeated measures; (2) the time series analysis (Campbell & Stanley, 1963); and (3) the multiple-baseline analysis (see Hersen & Barlow, 1976). The first two approaches provide the therapist with infonnation on client behavior-change across time, but are not experimental designs and therefore cannot be used to attribute client change to the intervention itself. The single-subject multiple baseline, a more rigorous treatment evaluation methodology, does permit the attribution of client behaviorchange to the intervention, for reasons we will discuss. One-Client Pretraining and Posttraining Assessment This represents perhaps the easiest approach to intervention assessment, because all social-skill measures are taken at only two points in time: before and again subsequent to the training. The same measures can be used on each occasion. An example of this approach might be to objectively rate client perfonnance in the initial assessment interactions, which precede social-skills training (role-play perfonnance, semistructured or unstructured contrived interactions), on whatever component behaviors are of interest. Subjective or global evaluations ofcompetency in the practice interaction could be obtained. Also, the client can be asked to complete relevant self-report inventories, to self-monitor targeted social interactions in the natural environment for some period of time, and so on. All of the obtained pretraining measures are then scored or quantified. No further assessment takes place until the conclusion of 124 Social-SkiUs Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions training, when the same measures are re-administered and self-monitoring data are again collected by the client for an interval oftime comparable to that in the pretraining period. All posttraining data sources are quantified or scored, and it is possible for the therapist to compute change on each of them. The therapist can then determine pretraining-to-posttraining changes on every componentbehavior that was rated during the client\\'s sample interactions, on global numeric ratings of overall skill in these sample interactions, on self-report measures, and on data derived from the client\\'s self-monitoring records. The advantages of this evaluation approach rest with its simplicity and the low amount of time and effort it requires by the therapist and the client. It also provides the therapist with objective information on client behavior change from one point in time compared with another. However, as noted by Campbell and Stanley (1963), it does not tell the therapist why change has occurred. Improvement may have been due to the intervention, but might also be attributed to practice effects (unrelated to the specific treatment approach), \"history\" or specific events outside of treatment that account for improvement (e.g., the establishment of new relationships); maturation of the client; and other factors unrelated to the intervention per se (Campbell & Stanley, 1963). Also, pretraining-to-posttraining changes for one client cannot be examined statistically for significance, so data obtained in this fashion cannot be rigorously analyzed and must be considered as essentially descriptive. While not a controlled research design, examining pretraining-to-posttraining change on social-skill measures can provide descriptive, quantified infonnation on client behavior-change over time. Time Series Analysis Campbell & Stanley (1963) have described a treatment-evaluation approach for groups that can be used for an individual client as well. Tenned the \"time series experiment,\" this procedure is essentially a modification of the pretraining-toposttraining assessment except that all measures are obtained on a number of different spaced occasions before and after the intervention. This can be represented in diagrammatic fashion as: x where each \"0\" or observation indicates a time when social-skills measures are taken (01-04 are all repetitions of the pretest; 05-08 are all repetitions of the posttest) and the \"X\" indicates the treatment intervention itself. In practice, this approach might be used when a client is assessed on each measure once weekly for four weeks before training starts and, again, once weekly for four weeks upon conclusion of the intervention. As Campbell and Stanley point out, this approach improves upon the Assessing the Effect of Social-Skills Interventions 125 \"one-time\" pretraining and posttraining assessment method in a number of ways. Improvement due to practice alone could be detected, because it would be evident if performance improved from one pretraining assessment to another intheabsence oftraining. However, thetimeseriesanalysisstillcannotruleout the possibility that external events that temporally coincide with treatment are responsible for any improvement seen in the posttraining assessments. Also, although statistical analyses of time series measures for individually treated clients have been described (Gottman, McFall, & Barnett, 1969; Kazdin, 1976), this statistical approach ordinarily requires that measures be taken on a great number ofoccasions, in excess ofwhat would be practical in most applied settings. However, the therapist who wishes to evaluate skills-training intervention with somewhat greater rigor than is possible with the simple pretraining-posttraining assessment may wish to consider the time series analysis. Multiple Baseline Analysis Across Skill-Component Behaviors The treatment evaluation strategy known as the multiple baseline has become an extremely popular method for analyzing the effect of applied behavioral interventions, including social-skills training with individually treated clients. Originally described by Baer, Wolf, and Risley (1968), potential uses of this evaluation technique have been elaborated by other investigators (see Barlow & Hersen, 1973; Hersen & Barlow, 1976; Wolf & Risley, 1971) and have seen wide application in the skills-training literature. Several reasons for the multiple baseline\\'s popularity are its suitability for single-client interventions, its ability to clearly establish that client behavior-change is a consequence of training, and the fact that the methodology does not require any aspect of clinical treatment to be sacrificed for experimental control purposes. Let us consider in detail an example to illustrate how this procedure can be used. Bomstein, Bellack, and Hersen (1977) individually treated several child clients who were described as exceedingly passive, shy, and unassertive, especially when confronted with unreasonable behavior from others. Based on interview information, a number of specific interpersonal problem-situations were defmed. Following techniques such as those elaborated in Chapter 3, role-play assessment scenes were constructed to approximate each potentially troublesome situation. Each role-play described a different situation and required the client to respond to antagonistic or unreasonable comments delivered by the role-play partner as though the client were actually in that situation. Client performance in the assessment role-plays was videotape recorded and ratedto determine those component-behaviors ofeffectiverefusal assertiveness that were deficient. The rating procedure consisted of having an observer watch each client\\'s role-plays and, using a rating form that listed all components of effective assertion, indicate the degree to which each behavioral component 126 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions was present for each role-play\\'scene. Major deficits were found on such components as eye contact while speaking to the partner, loudness of speech, and requesting more acceptable future behaviors from the antagonist partner. Over the next two sessions, the same assessment procedure was repeated, with each client role-playing how he or she would handle the same set of scenes. These additional assessment role-plays were also rated to determine whether the clients\\' responses included the refusal-assertion components. As might be expected, the same components remained deficient across all three separate assessment sessions. This demonstrated that (I) the identified components were consistently deficient in assertive responses; (2) a stable pretraining (baseline) rate could be established for each of these component deficits; and (3) the client\\'s role-play performance did not improve over time as a result of repeated practice alone. After the three separate role-play assessment sessions, Bomstein et al. first directed attention toward teaching one of the clients to maintain eye contact with the partner whenever speaking to him. Training sessions always included instruction, modeling, rehearsal, reinforcement, and feedback in much the same manner as described in Chapter 4. For the behavior rehearsal portion of each session, the client role-played each of six scenes that had been used in the initial assessment role-plays. Iftraining was successful on the first day that eye contact received training attention, one would expect to find that the client more frequently exhibited this behavior during the session\\'s role-plays. To assess this, the investigators rated each of the practice or rehearsal role-plays from the frrst training session and found that the targeted eye contact component had increased. During initial assessment role-plays, the client\\'s ratio of eye contact to speech duration was zero; the client never looked at the partner during any ofthe six role-played scenes on the three occasions when the scenes were presented. On the frrst training day, ratings of the client\\'s eye contact revealed an immediate and striking eye contact increase to 100% of speech duration time. Further, when the other deficient components were rated from role-play responses on the frrst training day when eye contact was targeted, it was found that they remained as deficient as they had been during pretraining assessment. With this finding rests the essential rationale for a multiple baseline analysis. Overthecourse ofpretraining-assessmentrole-plays, astable(albeitdeficient) baseline level is established for each ofthe component-behaviors that will later require treatment attention. In this case, the components were eye contact, speech loudness, and requests for new behavior from the partner. When training on one component is introduced, the therapist expects that an increase in this targeted component should be evident in the client\\'s practice that day. Since other component behaviors do not receive training attention in the same session, the therapist expects (or predicts) that they will be unchanged in that Assessing the Effect of Social-Skills Interventions 127 session\\'s role-plays. Further, the next component to be trained should increase in the client\\'s practice only at the time it receives specific attention in the intervention. The third component is predicted to improve contingent upon specific training, and so forth. Figure 5.1 is a graphed presentation of the role-play performance for one client in the Bomstein et al. (1977) project throughout the entire intervention. Each separate graph in the vertical series represents a different behavior that was to be trained. The uppermost graph is the first component to be trained, the graph below it is the second component behavior, and so on. Across the horizontal axis are sessions; the vertical axis for each separate graph indicates the range of that component behavior over the six role-played scenes. the vertical dotted line through each graph indicates the first session in which that component-behavior was specifically targeted for training. For example, in the uppermost graph, the frrst 3 data points are from the pretraining assessment role-plays. When training was introduced on eye contact (session 4, and actuallythe firsttrainingdayafterassessmentsessions), theratio ofeyecontact to speech duration increased from zero to 1.00 or 100% eye contact while speaking to the partner. Thus, the first component improved, but only contingent upon specific training in that day\\'s session. The next two sessions continued to focus on eye contact in order to establish it even more firmly. The second skill behavior, speech loudness, was frrst trained in session 7, as indicated by the broken vertical line in the next lower graph. Inspecting the graph for speech loudness, we find that ratings revealed deficiency throughout its own baseline (or the entire interval until treatment attention was targeted to it), at which point this component also improved. The multiple baseline rationale, in this case, is that when a global skill is broken down into separate and independent component-behaviors, each component should increase, but only contingent upon the introduction of specific training for it. If all components improved at the same time when only one of them was being trained, it would suggest that improvement was not due to treatment, since only one aspect of the goal skill was receiving attention. Conversely, if a component failed to increase when training was specifically targeted toward it, this would suggest that the treatment was ineffective in that session. Now, let us consider how this evaluation design \"meshes\" with the skillstraining intervention model described earlier. It was suggested that a final-goal social skill be broken into behavioral components and that each component sequentially receive training attention across sessions. If a relatively standard practice-interaction is included in each training session, the procedure necessary to perform a multiple baseline analysis is in place. AU that is then required is for the therapist or some other observer to rate the client\\'s performance in each session\\'s practice interaction. This should ordinarily occur in training FIGURE 5.1.

However, a quantitative observation procedure is needed in order to graph the client\\'s performance with respect to each component-behavior in every session\\'s practice. This can be accomplished by using a rating form such as that utilized in the evaluation of initial assessment interaction before the training phase of the intervention began. It is noteworthy that the multiple baseline analysis used in this way only requires the therapist to objectively rate or count, and then graph, the client\\'s practice performance in each session. Thus, it is an evaluation design wellsuited to applied settings, since it does not require outside control groups, removal of any treatment, or elaborate costs in time or support. There are a number of issues related to multiple baseline methodology concerning such questionsas the independence ofcomponent-behaviors, thenumber oftraining sessions per component-behavior necessary to conclusively establish its improvement, and so forth. For example, a multiple baseline analysis of this kind assumes that the component-behaviors that are separately trained are independentofoneanother, oruncorrelated. Iftwo components are correlated, such as voice tone and affect ratings might be, we would expect that training on one would also cause the other to change, even when the second component was not directly treated. When conducting a multiple baseline analysis across socialskill components, it is desirable to train each behavior for several sessions. This would establish more conclusively that the targeted component demonstratably improves, while the as-yet untreated components do not improve. Additionally, while most multiple baseline data graphs are inspected visually to determine whether improvement occurred, statistical analyses for single-subject designs can be conducted. The reader interested in these issues might consult a source such as Hersen and Barlow (1976). Finally, it is possible to combine a multiple baseline analysis of client performance during each session\\'s practice interactions with other measures administered at the beginning and the conclusion of the entire intervention. These pretraining and posttraining measures might include self-report inventories, global evaluations of overall social competency, or self-monitoring records. Treatment Evaluation Designs for Group Social-Skills Training The kind of evaluation procedure used to assess the impact of a group socialskillstraining interventionisdeterminedby boththedegree ofevaluativerigor sought by the therapist and the availability of a control group. Three of the intervention-evaluation procedures we will consider are group modifications of 130 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions the pretraining-posttraining, time series analysis, and multiple-baselineacross-skill-componentbehaviordesigns justdescribed. None oftheserequires control groups. Several designs that require a control group will be briefly considered. One-Group Pretraining and Posttraining Assessment For individually treated clients, the most rudimentary form ofobjective assessment is achieved by administering all skill measures-behavioral, global competency judgments, inventories, and self-monitoring records-before and again after training. This procedure can be used for all members of the social-skills training group (Campbell & Stanley, 1963). Depending on the nature of the sample social interactions used, the performance of all clients in the group might be individually observed in pretraining and posttraining interactions, such as a standard role-play job-interview or semistructured interaction. Alternatively, each client might be asked to repeat the sample interactions that had been constructed specifically for him or her, such as individualized assertion role-plays, both before and after training. The benefits and limitations of the single-group pretraining-posttraining assessment are the same as the single-client pretraining-posttraining assessment. This procedure is time-efficient and does provide objective data on client social-behavior-change. It does not provide experimental control, since the therapist cannot determine that any observed change is a function of the treatment intervention rather than extraneous or nonspecific factors that also occurred between pretraining and posttraining assessments (Campbell & Stanley, 1963). Time Series Analysis for Group Interventions The time series evaluation approach ofconducting a series of assessments both before and subsequent to the training intervention phase can be used for all members ofa group. Here, each client who will be in the group is individually assessed on a number of occasions (e.g., weekly) on all social-skill measures. Then, after the training intervention, each client again is repeatedly assessed on the same measures that had been administered before treatment. This evaluationstrategyiscommended byitsrelatively lowrequirements ofstaffandclient time and effort. Its major limitation involves the fact that observed client behavior-change, even if consistently low when sampled across all pretraining occasions and then consistently high across all posttraining occasions, still cannot be conclusively attributed to the interceding training (Campbell & Stanley, 1963). Assessing the Effect of Social-Skills Interventions 131 Multiple Baseline Analysis Across Skill-Component Behaviors When Training Is Group-Administered The multiple baseline assessment of an individually treated client is achieved when that client\\'s behavioral performance in a sample social interaction is observed during or following each training session. It must be demonstrated that the specific skill-component receiving training attention on a given day improves in that day\\'s behavioral practice relative to its levels before receiving attention, while components that have not yet been targeted for treatment do not improve in practice interactions until they are specifically trained. The same multiple baseline rationale can be used to evaluate the behavior-change of individual clients when each of those clients is a member of the same socialskills training group (Kelly, 1980). This treatment evaluation approach was used in studies that were previously described. For example, in one group conversational-skills training project (Kelly, Urey, & Patterson, 1980), each client engaged in a fixed-length, semistructured conversation immediately following every group training session. In the conversations, clients were instructed to focus on exhibiting the component behavior that had received training in the immediately preceding group session. By audiotaping each client\\'s conversation following every session, the therapist could rate the interactions for all verbal components and determine how frequently each occurred. As predicted, components always increased in the post-group conversations contingent on specific training. A similar approach has been used in group job-interview training interventions (see Kelly, Laughlin, Claiborne, & Patterson, 1979; Kelly, Wildman, & BerIer, 1980). Here, the frequency with which group members exhibited verbal components during their individual, standardized job-interview role-plays after each group session was evaluated. Figure 5.2 presents a graph of the role-play interview performance ofclients in the Kelly, Laughlin, Claiborne, and Patterson (1979) project. The graphic presentation shows a multiple baseline across three component-behaviors, with group training sequentially targeting: (1) directing job-related questions to an interviewer; (2) making statements conveying positive information about experience and training during an interview; and (3) verbally conveying interest or enthusiasm in the prospective position. Each line on the graph represents the performance of a given client. The target components shown in this figure generally increased during each client\\'s individual practice role-play interviews following group training sessions, but improvement always occurred when the component was specifically given treatment attention in the group. This use of the multiple baseline is quite similar to that in individual client applications; here, treatment is administered to a group of clients rather than just one. Each client is individually assessed during his or her practice interaction during or immediately after every group session. The therapist must 132 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions observe the interactions, either directly or by making recordings of them, which can be rated later. The ratings are then quantified to yield frequencies of occurrence for each component under study, so that these data can be graphed for each client. If most clients improve in their individual practice following training on the component that received group attention, the effectiveness of the intervention can be conclusively established without the need for external control groups (Kelly, 1980). Control-Group Designs to Assess an Intervention\\'s Effectiveness A very wide range of rigorous intervention-evaluation designs is available to the therapist who has access to control groups against which to evaluate the performance of clients in the social-skills training group. While an exhaustive discussion of \"between-groups\" designs suitable for evaluating social-skills interventions is beyond the scope of this book, we might consider two of the basic control-group evaluation strategies, described by Campbell & Stanley (1963), which are feasible in some applied settings. Nonequivalent Control-Group Design The nonequivalent control group design requires the presence of two groups of clients, one of which will receive the social-skills training intervention and one of which will serve as the control group. In this evaluation design, clients are not randomly assigned to the skills-training or control group. Thus, if a group of individuals has been selected to receive skills-training and some other, similar group of clients already exists in the treatment setting, the latter group can serve as controls. As noted by Campbell and Stanley, it is desirable for skills-training and control-group clients to resemble or be matched with one another as closely as possible on any characteristics that might affect their social functioning. However, because clients are not randomly assigned to the two groups, the design is not as rigorous as when random assignment is used. Its chief virtue is that this is a control-group treatment-evaluation design that can represent a reasonable compromise between true experimental control and the practical realities that often operate in applied treatment settings. In this evaluation strategy, all clients in both the skills-training and control group are administered all skill measures before the intervention takes place. These measures might include assessment role-plays, sample interactions, self-report inventories, data achieved through self-monitoring or direct in-vivo observations, and so on. Then, clients in the skills-training group receive their entire intervention while clients in the control group receive either no training or some other form of non-social-skills treatment. At the conclusion of this phase, all clients from both groups are re-administered each of the same Bas.liIl. Baselin. I 2 3 4 FIGURE 5.2.

Based upon statistically analyzed changes on each measure for both the skills-training and control groups, the therapist will be in a position to evaluate skill-improvement in the treatment group relative to the control group. For example, by rating the performance of social-skills training and control-group clients during their pretraining and posttraining sample interactions, it may be found that the skills-training group members exhibit all rated component-behaviors more frequently at posttraining assessment than do control clients. Similar superiority for the social-skills training might be demonstrated by self-report inventory scores or frequencies of self-monitored in-vivo social interactions in which the skill was used over a one-week period of time. Thus, the therapist will have obtained information documenting the effect of the social-skills training intervention relative to either a\"no-treatment\" control or, more likely, relative to the form of treatment that control-group clients received during the interval in which skills-training clients were receiving their intervention. However, because clients are not randomly assigned to one group or another in this strategy, it remains possible that some outside factors are responsible for the differential change of one group relative to the other. This is possible even when clients in the two groups appear to be comparable with one another. The only way to conclusively demonstrate the performance change of one group over another is if clients have been randomly assigned to their respective groups. Random-Assignment Control Group A study by Hollandsworth, Dressel, and Stevens (1977) illustrates how the random-assignment control-group evaluation design can be used. Hollandsworth et al. were interested in comparing the effects of behavioral jobinterview training, a discussion-based but nonbehavioral job-interview counseling approach, and no treatment for college seniors who would soon be seeking employment. All clients, regardless of the form of training they were randomly selected to receive, role-played a simulated, standard job interview and completed a self-report scale measuring social anxiety. Clients then received their respective treatment: social-skills-behavioral training, traditional discussion, or no treatment. Afterward, each student repeated the role-play interview and was re-administered the social-anxiety inventory. The pretraining and posttraining role-played interviews of all clients were rated on such components as eye contact, speech duration, speech loudness, positive selfstatements, explanatory statements of vocational-educational skill, etc. Statistical analyses, which compared mean-change scores of client performance in the three groups, were conducted on each measure. Because Hollandsworth et al. (1977) found that discussion and behavioral-skills training were each Assessing the Effect of Social-Skills Interventions 135 associated with improvement on different measures when compared to the no-training control group, the investigators suggest combining behavioral and discussion modes of treatment within job-interview training. Designs for Evaluating Treatment: A Summary In this section, we have sampled several approaches that can be used to evaluate social-skills training interventions. The particular evaluation method selected will depend on the kind of question the therapist would like to answer, the degree to which the therapist wishes to rigorously establish that training was responsible for observed social-skill improvement, the resources or support that an applied setting can devote to intervention assessment, and the time constraints or interests of the therapist. In many cases, simple pretraining and posttraining assessment of clients of social-skills measures may yield all the information that the therapist seeks on the success of his or her social-skills training. In other cases, more controlled evaluation strategies such as time series analysis, multiple baseline analysis, or \"between-groups\" designs can be used to provide treatment outcome information. There are no intrinsically \"right\" or \"wrong\" intervention-assessment strategies, although some approaches do provide more specific and conclusive information than others. Perhaps the most important point is that the therapist not take any intervention\\'s outcome for granted, no matter how well the intervention is thought out. Instead, planning an applied intervention should also include the planning ofobjective mechanisms by which that intervention\\'s clinical success can also be gauged. By incorporating treatment-evaluation measures into skills-training, the therapist will be in a position to gain objective information on whether or not clients improve. If objective measures indicate there has not been improvement, the therapist will be in a position to provide the client with additional training. If objective measures do demonstrate improvement, the therapist\\'s confidence in the success ofhis orherowninterventions will be substantiated by empirical data. Chapter 6 Conversational-Skills Training The tenn \"conversational skills\" refers to the ability to successfully initiate and then maintain informal conversations with other people. An effective conversa~ tional repertoire not only pennits an individual to come across well during infonnal interactions, but is also a likely precursor to the development of longer-range relationships such as friendships, because forming those rela~ tionships frrst requires that the individual successfully interact with other people in conversation. In contrast to other types of social skills that serve relatively circumscribed purposes, such as refusal-assertion or job~interview skills, conversational competence is needed across a wide variety of everyday interpersonal situations. Date-initiation behavior, which will be considered in the next chapter, represents the specialized kind of conversational skill that is used when the purpose of the interaction is specifically to obtain a date. When teaching conversational skills, the therapist is assisting the client in learning new verbal, nonverbal, and stylistic behaviors to use when conversing with other people. The training seeks to build those behavioral competencies that permit a client to obtain the goal of meeting and conversing with others in an effective manner; training also seeks to increase the client\\'s own reinforce~ ment value to others so that they find the client to be a reinforcing social agent and they are then more likely to reciprocate or maintain interactions with him. Client Populations for Whom Conversational-Skills Training Has Been Used Within the social-skills training literature, conversational training has been used most extensively with four distinct client populations: persons who are or who have been institutionalized in psychiatric facilities; mentally retarded citizens; adolescents; and college students reporting difficulties or discomfort in conversations with others. As we briefly noted in Chapter I, individuals who have been confined in 136 Conversational-Skills Training 137 institutional settings often exhibit pervasive social-skill deficits, including the inability to initiate and maintain appropriate conversations with others. During recent years, there has been a significant trend away from institutionalization and toward community-based treatment for persons who have been previously confined to institutional psychiatric settings. This has resulted in the discharge of many long-term psychiatric patients to community settings-halfway houses, day hospital programs, mental health aftercare, and so on. Similarly, mentally retarded persons are increasingly placed in nonresidential environments, as shown by increased attention to educational mainstreaming, vocational training, and placement in cooperative apartment housing and halfway houses in the community. A number ofinvestigators have pointed out that institutionalized or formerly institutionalized persons who lack appropriate everyday conversational skills will not be in a position to establish social relationships in the community because they come across to others as peculiar, dull, unrewarding, or even threatening (Bellack & Hersen, 1978; Kelly, Urey, & Patterson, 1980; Kelly, Wildman, Urey, & Thurman, 1979; Urey et al., 1979). In essence, as long as an individual appears to others to be a \"former psychiatric patient\" or \"retarded,\" it is unlikely that other people will be eager to develop everyday relationships with that individual. This social avoidance serves to ensure continued isolation; the absence of relationship supports in the community may, in turn, be associated with poor adjustment outside the institution and increased recidivism (re-admission) rates (Phillips, 1968; Zigler & Phillips, 1962). The aim ofconversational-skills training for institutionalized, aftercare, or mentally retarded clients is to equip them with appropriate competencies they can use in the course of everyday, informal interactions. Other investigators have applied conversational-skills training procedures to higher-functioning clients who exhibit either deficiencies in their conversational ability or discomfort during such interactions. For example, Minkin et al. (1976) successfully provided conversational-skills training to four adolescent delinquent girls who were unable to communicate effectively and were unlikely to develop successful peer relationships with others as a result of their conversational deficits. A similar project, intended to teach predelinquent adolescents to converse more effectively with adults, was reported by Maloney, Harper, Braukmann, Fixsen, Phillips, and Wolf (1976). Still other investigators have described the successful results of conversational-skills training interventions for college students experiencing social anxiety and problems in interpersonal communication (cf. Arbes & Hubbell, 1973). In general, it appears that training in conversational skills is indicated for both residential or outpatient populations when: (1) the client currently exhibits deficient performance during informal conversations with others; (2) the client is unable to establish friendships or other relationships because he or she lacks 138 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions the skills repertoire to meet others, converse with them, and be a socially rewarding agent; or (3) the client currently avoids conversations with other people due to anxiety associated with these interactions, fear of negative evaluation from others, etc. Conversational-Skill Assessment In this section, we will fIrst examine and defIne those behavioral components that have been related to overall conversational skill. Attention will then be given to procedures for rating clients\\' practice conversations to assess the presence of those component behaviors. Finally, several self-report inventories, which can be used as supplemental data sources to evaluate the effectiveness of a conversational-skills training intervention, will be considered. Behavioral Definitions ofComponents of Conversational Skill In Chapter 3, the component makeup of various types of social skills was discussed. As we then noted, behaviors that have been postulated as components of conversational skill include: eye contact; affect; speech duration; conversational questions; self..<Jisclosing statements; and reinforcing or complimentary comments. For a therapist to reliably assess the presence of these behaviors in a client\\'s conversations (such as during pretraining-assessment conversations or practice conversations during the course of training) or to convey to the client how to exhibit them during interactions, it is necessary to defIne all component behaviors in an objective fashion. As we might expect, investigators of conversational skills have not always used identical defInitions even for the same component. For example, some investigators have measured eye contact as the amount of time the client looks at the interaction partner; otherinvestigatorshavemeasuredthe amountoftime thattheclientlooks atthe partner and the partner also looks back. These procedural discrepancies notwithstanding, let us consider component defInitions that the therapist can use when evaluating client conversations or when training conversational skills. Eye contact. Eye contact can be behaviorally defIned as the percentage of time when the client is speaking or listening to the conversational partner that the client also looks directly at the partner\\'s face. Iftheclientspends atotal of6 minutes actively conversing with a partner, and if the therapist observes eye contact to be made for 3 of those minutes, client eye contact can be estimated to be 50%. Ifextremely precisemeasurement ofeyecontact issought, thetherapistcan separately \"time\" the client\\'s speaking and listening duration and the duration of this period when client eye contact is also observed. By dividing the eye Conversational-Skills Training 139 contact time by the speaking and listening time, the exact percentage of client eye contact can be ascertained. However, it is also possible for a therapist to rate eye contact less formally, by estimating the appropriate percentage of conversation time when eye contact is observed (0, 10%,20%.30%, and so on). Affect. Mfect represents the degree to which the client\\'s emotional tone is judged to be appropriate to the situation in which he or she is interacting. Mfect is usually measured as a single component, although external judgments of conversational affect are based on such cues as the client\\'s observed voice tone, facial expression. and voice modulation or loudness. An affect-rating is often made by the observer using an anchored rating scale; one example of this is a scale from 1 = extremely appropriate affect to7 = extremely inappropriate affect. The client\\'s overall behavior throughout the entire observed conversation is the basis for the affect judgment. Because affective appropriateness is linked to the situation in which one observes a client, the particular emotional tone that is considered appropriate will necessarily vary. For example, affect in a conversation is generally appropriateiftheclientappearswarm, friendly, interestedinandresponsiveto the partner, lively, and so on. However, if a conversational partner at some point tells the client about a very unfortunate or unhappy event, we would expect the client\\'s emotion to change and be more subdued, sympathetic, or consoling. A form of inappropriate conversational affect that is seen in some clients is an absence or flatness ofemotional tone. Schizophrenic patients often exhibit a dullness of affect, which makes them appear both very disinterested in others and uninteresting to others. Here, the patient\\'s affect would be considered inappropriate because of its absence, rather than because it is mismatched with the content of a conversation. Speech duration. The duration of a client\\'s total speaking time in a conversation bas been associated with conversational competence by a number of investigators (see Kelly, Furman, Phillips, Hathorn, & Wilson, 1979; Minkin et al., 1976). Speech duration is generally targeted for assessment and training attention among clients who provide very little verbal input during their conversations with others. On the other hand, some clients talk excessively during conversations; here, the aim of training might be achieving a reduction in their speech duration. Duration of speech is usually measured by the therapist activating a stopwatch whenever the client speaks during a conversation. Speech-duration measurement provides the therapist with information on the quantity of verbal input by a client during his or her conversations. However, speech duration alone does not provide information on the qualitative or content aspects of that client\\'s conversation. For this reason, low speech 140 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions duration during pretraining assessment interactions is often treated by teaching the client to increase the frequency of other verbal conversational component behaviors, such as asking questions, or making self-disclosing statements. When these verbal behaviors are increased, speech-duration ratings will also increase, since the client will then be talking more. Conversational questions. A conversational question can be defined as any question asked by the client that results in the partner\\'s disclosure of some information. Conversational questions can be direct requests for information, such as: \"Where do you go to school?\"; \"What do you like to do in your spare timeT\\'; or \"Do you ever go fishing?\" Questions might also include statements that function to elicit information from a conversational partner, even if they are not phrased directly as interrogative comments. Examples of indirect questions might include: \"Tell me more about that\"; \"Oh, really?\"; or \"So you are in school\" (Minkin et aI., 1976). The crucial element is that a conversational question asked by the client leads the partner to disclose information. Conversational questions, like the other verbal content behaviors we will discuss in this section, can most easily be rated by tallying the number of times they occur throughout the entire conversation. The therapist observing an assessment or practice interaction can simply count the total frequency of questions asked by the client to the partner for a conversation of some fixed duration. Self-disclosing statements. Another content component of conversational skill involves the client\\'s verbalization of statements that convey appropriate information about himself or herself to the partner in the interaction (Kelly, Urey, & Patterson, 1980). A self-disclosing statement is any \"piece\" of information that conveys self-disclosing information. Examples of selfdisclosing statements include: \"I like to water ski in the summer\"; \"I come from a large family\"; \"My favorite television program is Lou Grant\"; or \"I really hated that test.\" Each of these statements discloses something of the interests, hobbies, background, preferences, or opinions of the speaker and thereby permits the other person to get to know the speaker more thoroughly. Although this component has been termed self-disclosure, the label does not imply the revelation of highly personal information, deep feeling-statements, or an individual\\'s secrets. Indeed, disclosing overly personal information in a conversation with a relative stranger can probably be viewed as undesirable and socially unskilled, since it may make the partner ill-at-ease. Similarly, ..tatements that convey negative personal information are not counted as appropriate self-disclosure statements. Such undesirable disclosures might include references to loneliness, treatment for emotional problems, self-deprecating statements, and so on. Self-disclosing statements can be feasibly rated in a client\\'s sample conversations by using a frequency count system and tallying the total number of Conversational-Skills Training 141 such statements throughout an entire interaction. The therapist will need to determine how self-disclosure \"facts\" that are linked together in a client\\'s conversation will be rated. For example, if a client tells the partner \"I like to go swimming in the summer, but prefer to read in the winter,\" the single sentence could be rated as two separate disclosures since two different pieces ofinformation are conveyed. Reinforcing or complimentary components. Reinforcing or complimentary comments (Kelly, Urey, & Patterson, 1980) or positive conversational feedback (Minkin et al., 1976) can be defined as verbalizations made by the client that directly compliment the partner or reinforce the partner\\'s speech by acknowledging that the client approves, concurs, or understands what the partner just said. We can include in this component category such direct compliments as \"That\\'s very nice\"; \"I enjoy talking to you\"; or \"You must be good at tennis.\" At the same time, a variety of less-direct statements also serve to convey the client\\'s interest in the other conversant, and thereby reinforce the other person\\'s speech. These might include such acknowledgments as \"I know\"; \"Good\"; \"Hmm\"; or \"Right!\" The frequency of such reinforcing comments can be rated by counting the number of times they are emitted by the client during an entire sample conversation. Rating Client Conversation for the Presence of Skill-Components As we noted earlier, the client\\'s assessment conversations are observed by the therapist before the skills-training intervention begins, in order to pinpoint those components that are deficient and that will need specific training. During the course of the intervention, client practice conversations are also observed and rated to determine whether the individual now exhibits any conversational skill components that were previously deficient. To accomplish this behavioral assessment of conversational skills, the therapist can use a rating form to summarize information on the client\\'s exhibition of all relevant componentbehaviors during an observed interaction. A sample rating form for conversational-skills assessment is presented as Figure 6.1. Let us assume that we are conducting an initial pretraining or baseline skill-evaluation and that we will observe a client\\'s conversational behavior during a semistructured or unstructured interaction, as outlined in Chapter 3. The client and conversational partner, perhaps a therapist confederate, are seated together and are asked to get to know one another better for a fixed 8-minute period of time. The therapist or some other observer is located unobtrusively, but is able to see and hear the interaction; as discussed in the chapter on assessment, variations in this observational system also include audiotaping or videotaping the interaction so that it can be rated later, or asking FIGURE 6.1.

As the conversation begins, the therapist makes a notation on the rating form when any of the verbal component behaviors occurs. A tally-mark is placed in the appropriate category whenever the client directs a conversational question to the partner, makes a self-disclosing statement, or makes a reinforcing or complimentary comment. The therapist can also attend to those skillcomponents that are not discrete, \"countable\" behaviors, such as the percentage of time when eye contact is made and the client\\'s affective appropriateness; ratings for each ofthese components canbe markedon the form atthe end ofthe conversation. Total client speech-duration, timed by activating a stopwatch whenever the client is speaking, might also be determined for the entire conversation. By the conversation\\'s end, the therapist will have a quantified record of the client\\'s performance with respect to each rated component. An identical procedure can be used to rate sample conversations at any point in the intervention, including at the time of pretreatment assessment, during conversational practice associated with individual training sessions, or at the conclusion of the intervention. Ratings of Other Conversational Skill-Components. The component-behaviors included in the sample rating-form are based on conversational skill research; however, it is important to note that there are undoubtedly other desirable behaviors that contribute to overall conversational skill. Certainly, this component rating-list does not exhaust all the behaviors that skilled persons exhibit in conversation. The therapist conducting a skillstraining intervention should bear in mind that additional verbal or nonverbal behaviors can be examined or rated in client-assessment conversations and later trained in the intervention. For example, a given client might sit in a \"wooden\" manner and never gesture during interactions. A posture and gesturing component might then be added to the list of assesssment and training components for that individual client. Whenever a \"new\" component is examined, it is important that the therapist also determine some way to objectively measure and later teach that behavior. For example, body posture or flexibility could be behaviorally defmed in terms offrequency ofobserved arm and hand movements or gestures throughout a sample conversation, or it could be defined in terms of somenumericalrating(e.g., from 1to7)todescribetheclient\\'soverallrigidity or flexibility of posture. It is also possible that certain clients may exhibit undesirable or inappropriate behaviors during conversation. For example, Ureyet al. (1979) found that one client persistently made negative comments ahout himself during assessment conversations, including talking ahout his \"nerve trouble\" with strangers. 144 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions Similarly, Stalonas and Johnson (1979) reported that a client made frequent \"disclaimers\" by compulsively overqualifying routine statements she made to others during everyday conversations. Other clients\\' conversational performance may be disrupted by speech dysfluencies, unusual mannerisms, or verbal content repetition. The therapist assessing a client whose conversations include the presence of inappropriate behaviors can adapt the rating-form to permit the scoring of them also. Because inappropriate conversational behaviors may spontaneously decrease as new, more appropriate skills become learned, ratings of these behaviors can serve as an ancillary measure of trainingeffectiveness. On the other hand, if a client continues to exhibit undesirable or inappropriate behaviors in practice conversations over the course of training, specific attention towards reducing them will also be needed. Assessing Deficiency Levels of Conversational Skills What observed frequency or rating for a conversational skill-component constitutes a deficiency? In Chapter 3, on client assessment, we noted that although research has established relationships between specific component behaviors and overall competence in a social skill, little attention has been given to the optimal rates of occurrence for various components over the course of an interaction. As an exarnple, let us ask what percentage of eye contact do most people maintain in a conversation? Over an 8-minute conversation with a stranger, how many questions does a skilled conversationalist ask, or how many statements ofself-disclosuredoesthatperson make? Unfortunately, there have been few normative studies to address these issues. It is evident that when a client is extremely deficient on any social-skill component, and when that component\\'s presence is known to be related to overall social competence, the behavior should then be targeted for training. These include cases of little or no eye contact, very poor affect, and very low-frequency verbal skill behaviors. In less extreme instances, and in the absence of normative or empirical data on ideal rates for conversational skill-components, the therapist may need to rely on more subjective impressions to determine whether or not a component behavior\\'s presence is at a sufficiently low level to merit attention in training. Similarly, the therapist will have to consider when to stop training a given behavior. If a client exhibits very low eye contact during pretraining assessment conversations, and if this behavior is then selected for later training, how much eye contact do we wish the client to learn to maintain? If the client maintained no eye contact during several pretrained conversations, but later demonstrated 50% eye contact during a practice conversation after it had received attention, should the therapist assume that it was at an ideal (or \"criterion\") level? Once again, these are important questions since too much of Conversational-Sldlls Training 145 an otherwise appropriate conversational behavior (eye contact, animated affect, questions, self-disclosures, or compliments) may cause the client to be perceived as inappropriate. The therapist\\'s subjective judgment is often required at this point; additionally, having an outside observer judge or rate the client\\'s global conversational competence during a sample interaction may provide useful information on the person\\'s overall social impact. Self-Report Inventories and Conversational Skill Self-report inventories do not provide the detailed information necessary to plan and conduct a social-skills training intervention, for reasons such as those considered in Chapter 5; however, they can provide a useful adjunctive source of information on an intervention\\'s success. There have been no published self-report inventories specifically for conversational skill or conversational anxiety. However, Watson and Friend (1969) have developed two scales relevant to the assessment of client-reported anxiety during informal social interactions with others. They are the Social Avoidance and Distress (SAD) Scale and the Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE). Items comprising the Social Avoidance and Distress Scale are presented in Figure 6.2. The SAD focuses upon the respondent\\'s feelings or behavior along two dimensions: social avoidance, or the tendency to avoid and escape from interactions, and social distress, which consists of negative emotions such as tension or anxiety during social interactions. The 28 items comprising the SAD are keyed to control for acquiescent response sets and the scale\\'s authors have provideddata supporting the validityandreliability ofthe inventory (Watson & Friend, 1969). High scores indicate greater social anxiety; the authors report normative college students scale means of 11.20 for males and 8.2 for females (out of a possible 28). However, Watson and Friend also note that the most frequent or modal SAD score based upon a normal college student sample was zero; consequently, high scores on this measure appear to demonstrate very severe social avoidance or discomfort. Applied conversational-skills training interventions might use an inventory such as the SAD to evaluate whether changes in a client\\'s generalized selfreports of social avoidance accompany skill-improvement over the course of treatment. Iftraining is successful, the therapist would expect that the individual\\'s reported social discomfort would decrease as the person begins to use newly trained behaviors during everyday conversational interactions. Becl!-use SAD-like inventories do tap generalized feelings, rather than specific social performance, and because it is likely that self-perception of improvement or reduced discomfort follows improved behavioral performance, one would not expect SAD scores to necessarily change from one session to the next. However, for those clients who provide reports of elevated social anxiety before an 146 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions intervention, there should be a reduction in SAD scores following conversational-skills training. A second inventory that may be appropriate for conversational-skills training projects is the Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE), which can be found in Watson and Friend (1969). The FNE is a 30-item true-false measure, constructed in similar fashion to the SAD. However, the FNE is intended to measure a client\\'s concern, apprehension, and worry about the way that others evaluate him or her, and it thereby taps a social-evaluative fear dimension. The item content of the FNE does not concern specific social or conversational situations; sample items include: \"I rarely worry about seeming foolish to others\"; \"I am afraid that people will find fault with me\"; and \"I often worry that I will say or do the wrong thing.\" Because FNE items are not tied to a given form of social situation, the scale could be used for various types of skillstraining interventions, including conversational skills. At the same time, the generality of item content makes the scale a very global and nonspecific assessment measure. FIGURE 6.2. Social Avoidance and Distress Scale\" 1.

Reprinted by permission. 174 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions Commendatory assertion, as we noted in an earlier chapter, serves to make a client a more effective \"dispenser\" of verbal reinforcement to others. Almost everyone enjoys receiving genuine positive recognition or compliments from others. Children generally like praise from their teachers, and teachers appreciate praise from their principals; clients generally respond well to commendation from their therapists, while therapists like to hear they have done a good job from their own bosses. Interstingly, in the child behavior-therapy literature, one of the most basic techniques to increase a child\\'s appropriate actions is providing specific praise from a parent or teacher whenever the child engages in the desired behavior. In essence, the parent is systematically using commendatory assertion to change the behavior of the child and bring about a more positive relationship with him. In somewhat analogous fashion, training in commendatory social skills teaches a client to be a more reinforcing agent to others in the environment. Because complimentary social behavior can exert a strong and positive influence on the conduct of other people, developing the ability to warmly and sincerely commend positive actions of others can be a powerful interpersonal skill. Many clients who report that others do not like them or who report that they are unable to influence the actions of others seem to be deficient in their use of commendatory assertiveness. I was once asked toconsult toa manufacturing company that was experiencing problems in supervisor-employee relations, including excessive absenteeism, tardiness, reduced production, and high employee turnover. An area of conflict appeared to involve the day-ta-day interactions of supervisors and the \"on-line\" employees under their direction. To assess this, a series of role-play situations were constructed to approximate some everyday interactions that a supervisormighthavewithasubordinate. Somerole-playswere ofsituationsin which the subordinate behaved unreasonably, persistently coming to work late, performing poor-quality and careless work, and so on. Supervisors were asked to role-play how they would handle these situations which require effective refusal-assertion skills. Other role-play scenes required the supervisor to interact with a role-play partner in situations where the partner, playing the subordinate, did something unusually well, such as offering to stay late to fmish an important project, completing a job ahead of schedule, or always coming to work a few minutes early. The latter scenes represent situations where effective commendatory skills would be desirable. Upon examining the role-play performance of company supervisors, it was evident that while most were quite skilled in handling the unacceptable behavior of the partner in the refusal-assertion scenes, very few were able to demonstrate effective commendatory skills for handling employees\\' good behavior in the role-play situations. It was not possible to conclusively attribute employee-relation difficulties at the company to the apparent inability of its supervisors to use commendatory skills effectively. However, one might suspect that skillsAssertiveness- Training 173 feelings and \"invite\" the antagonist to change his or her behavior, not to unleash belligerent comments on the other individual. Several recent studies have utilized naive observers or social-interaction participants to evaluate the behavior of persons who acted in either a passive, an assertive, or an aggressive manner when confronted by an antagonist (Hull & Schroeder, 1979; Mullinix &: Galassi, 1978; Woolfolk & Dever, 1979). For the most part, assertive skills were evaluated in favorable terms, while both passive and aggressive response styles were evaluated more negatively by the person observing them. One possible exception to this pattern involves the sex ofthe individual who is seen behaving assertively; some investigators have found that males handling troublesome situations in an assertive manner are evaluated by naive observers in more positive terms than females who behave assertively in identical situations (Kelly, Kern, Kirkley, Patterson, & Keane, 1980). We will later COD$ider the importance of using cognitive-modification procedures to help clients become less fearful ofthe possibility that other people may not respond well to their newly developing assertive skills. Refusal assertiveness differs from the other forms of social competency that we have considered to this point because it does not primarily bring about the establishment of new social relationships such as friendships, conversations, or dates. Instead, refusal-assertion skills prevent the loss of reinforcement to clients when people might otherwise take advantage of them. For example, individuals are occasionally confronted with situations in which someone else attempts to impose demands, take advantage, or otherwise unreasonably attempt to control them. Ifthat individual persistently capitulates to the unwarranteddemands ofothers whenhe orshewouldprefertobehaveotherwise, itis likely that feelings of helplessness, loss of control, diminished self-worth, or depression will result. However, when a client learns to behave more assertively in conflict situations, several desirable consequences can occur. One of the foremost is that the client can effectively bring about change in the antagonist\\'s behavior. When an overly passive client fails to convey his own position or feelings to others and fails to communicate a reasonable behavior-change request to another person, it is unlikely that the client will effect any behavior change from the other party. On the other hand, a demonstrative and clear statement of one\\'s own position is much more likely to serve functional purposes for the client by bringing about behavior change or, at least, further discussion to resolve any conflict. A second positive consequence of effective refusal-assertion skills is that, regardless of whether or not a client successfully does .change an antagonist\\'s unreasonable behavior, the client will be aware that be or she acted appropriately, rather than passively complying with someone else\\'s unreasonableness. Presumably, development of a skillsrepertoire to deal with conflict situations will lead to increased perceptions of self..efficacy rather than those of helplessness or frustration. Chapter 8 Assertiveness-Training Assertion-training is undoubtedly the fonn of social-skills treatment that has received the greatest attention in both the applied research literature and in clinical practice. Indeed, until somewhat recently, the tenns \"assertiontraining\" and \"social-skills training\" were often used in an interchangeable fashion; it was not recognized that assertiveness represents one specific kind of interpersonal competency. Although a large number of definitions have been proposed, assertiveness has been generally construed as the ability of an individual to effectively, and without discomfort, convey personal positions, opinions, beliefs, or feelings to another person. As we noted in Chapter 1, assertive responses may occur in the context of a disagreement or dispute between individuals, as when someone unreasonably attempts to block the goal-directed behavior of. a person. The fonn of assertiveness that is an appropriate response to such a situation is tenned refusal assertion, because the individual is refusing the unacceptable act or statement of the antagonist and attempting to bring about more acceptable behavior in the future. Commendatory assertion refers to an individual\\'s ability to express wann, complimentary feelings or opinions to others when their positive behavior warrants it. While investigators and clinicians have noted the importance of using each kind of assertiveness in daily living (see Lazarus, 1971; Wolpe, 1969), refusal assertion has received the greatest attention in the social-skills training literature. An important distinction should be made between refusal assertion and aggressiveness when confronted with unreasonable behavior from another person. Both do differ from passivity or compliance in the sense that the individual is not accepting an antagonist\\'s unacceptable behavior. However, the intent of an assertive response is to effectively communicate one\\'s own position and provide the antagonist with specific feedback concerning how he or she should behave in the future. While an assertive response is made in a fum, clear, and convincing manner, it is not hostile in tone, style, or verbal cootent. The purpose of refusal assertion is to calmly communicate one\\'s 172 Training for Date-Initiation and Other Heterosocial Skills 171 changes in hair style, dress, complexion, weight, or posture. Ifit appears that unattractive physical attributes ofa client are contributing to dating or heterosocial problems, the therapist may find it useful to provide attention to enhancing the individual\\'s appearance as well as his or her social skills. Arkowitz (1977), for example, has even suggested using special appearance consultants to instruct clients in ways to improve their dress, hairstyle, or grooming, ifthis is indicated. Cognitive Modification Aspects of Training In Chapter 4, it was suggested that cognitive-modification procedures be included in skills-training interventions in order to decrease anxiety-related thoughts and increase socially facilitative cognitions as clients approach and interact in previously troublesome situations. A study by Glass, Gottman, and Shmurak (1976) actually compared a heterosocial training-procedure without cognitive training, a procedure using only cognitive modification, and a technique combining behavioral-skills training with cognitive modification. The cognitiveaspect oftreatmenttaught clients to recognizetheirnegative thoughts related to heterosocial situations and then generate positive, alternative cognitions in their place (see Meichenbaum, 1972). Results of this project indicated that the skills-training-alone group and the combined-skills-training-withcognitive-modification group performed more skillfully than the cognitivemodification-alone group on social-interaction tests that had been the specific target of training. However, the cognitive-modification treatment was related to enhanced performance in novel social-interaction tasks, suggesting that this form of treatment may provide enhanced generalization to new interactions other than those specifically trained. In his review paper on heterosocial-skills training, Curran (1975) points out that the Glass et al. (1976) results seem to indicate that clients\\' initial level of heterosocial competence differentially affected their response to treatment. It appears that clients who were most skills-deficient achieved the greatest benefit from the combined skills-training with cognitive-modification treatment, while more frequent daters improved with cognitive modification alone. Presumably, clients who are extremely deficient in heterosocial functioning lack both the behavioral skills and the positive cognitions needed to handle such interactions. For them, skillstraining combined with thought-modification techniques appear quite promising. AsoutlinedinChapter4,onepracticalwaytocombinetheseapproachesin an intervention is to first focus on skills-training and, later in training, utilize cognitive-modification techniques and therapy procedures to increase client use of the new skills in the natural environment. 170 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions degree ofheterosocial discomfort. Ifthis was the case, the anxiety-reduction or desensitization aspect of practice-dating alone was probably a sufficient treatment. For more seriously deficient clients, skills-training would have to pre-cede in-vivo practice. Apart from interventions that use practice-dating as a primary mode of treatment, other social-skills training projects reviewed in this section often made use of self-monitoring diaries or other procedures to measure changes in heterosocial behavior outside the training setting. Although the purpose of this was usually to obtain research information on generalization of skills-training, an applied intervention can make use ofclient in-vivo self-monitoring information as a part of treatment itself. The therapist in individual-client training, or the therapist and other group members in group-administered training, can review client self-monitoringdata toreinforceclient reports ofdate-initiation or increased heterosocial interactions. This was incorporated as a part of training in the Twentyman and McFall (1975) project. In regard to dating practice, it may be necessary for the therapist to work with the client on increasing exposure to situations in the natural environment where there will be an opportunity to meet opposite-sex persons. One heterosocially unskilled college student seen by the author reported that he simply did not know where to meet other people. He characteristically would spend evenings sitting alone on campus, hoping that a woman might also sit down and initiate an interaction. With this client, and with other individuals who have very limited exposure to situations where they can meet potential dates, it may be necessary to do some practical planning to increase opportunities for heterosocial-skill use. This might include encouraging the client to attend social gatherings, dances, become involved in interest groups related to the client\\'s hobbies, do volunteer work in settings where one can meet opposite sex persons, or so on. Again, it is important that the client first acquire an adequate skills repertoire to successfully handle these situations. Physical Attractiveness in Relation to Dating In addition to a substantial research base suggesting that attractive physical appearance is quite strongly related to all types of successful interpersonal functioning (see Berscheid & Walster, 1973), Glasgow and Arkowitz (1975) have specifically reported differences in physical attractiveness between highand low-frequency daters. Several skills-training interventions included attention to improving one\\'s physical appearance (Curran & Gilbert, 1975; Curran et al., 1976), and Arkowitz (1977) has pointed out the need to strengthen physical-appearance training within date-initiation interventions. Although some aspects ofa client\\'s physical appearance may be unmodiftable, it is likely that many other contributors to attractiveness can be altered. These include Training for Date-Initiation and Other Heterosocial Skills 169 that are relevant to the applied therapist. These include the importance of in-vivo practice of heterosocial skills, enhancing clients\\' physical attractiveness, and stressing cognitive modification as a part of treatment. Dating-skills Practice in the Natural Environment Arkowitz and his associates have conducted a series of projects that demonstrate, simplyyeteffectively, theimportance ofbehavioralpracticein heterosocial-skills training. Christensen and Arkowitz (1974) recruited 14 male and 14 female college students for an intervention designed to increase their frequency, skills, and comfort when dating. Pretraining and posttraining measures included the Social Avoidance and Distress Scale and the Fear of Negative Evaluations Scale (Watson & Friend, 1969). Clients also self-monitored their frequencyofdatesandnondateheterosocialinteractionsfor 12daysbeforeand 12daysaftertraining. Theinterventionitselfconsisted of6 practice-dateswith otherclients in the project. Opposite-sex clients were randomly paired with one another for practice-dates by the therapists; the male and female clients who had been matched for a practice-date on a given week were provided with one another\\'s names and phone numbers, and were asked to settle on all date details with one another when the male called the female with whom he was matched. All clients were aware that their dates would be with other clients and that the purpose of the intervention was to simply provide dating practice. No two clients were matched with each other more than once. Following a practicedate, each client completed a feedback form describing aspects of his or her partner\\'s behavior that were desirable or that needed attention. The forms were given to the therapist, who then forwarded them to the appropriate client. Christensen and Arkowitz (1974) reported improvement from pretraining to posttraining both for self-report measures and for frequency of actual dating with persons other than clients. Clients also reported decreases in their heterasocial anxiety over the course of training. 10 a second study, Christensen, Arkowitz, and Anderson (1975) included a control group and varied whether or not clients in the practice-dating intervention received weekly feedback from their matched dating partners. The investigators found that clients in the practice interventions, with or without partner feedback, showed greater improvement on a variety of anxiety, dating frequency, and social-skill measures than did the control group clients. These projects are noteworthy because clients received only in-vivo practice with feedback, rather than formal training in effective heterosocial skills. However, it is important to recognize that clients in these studies were not extremely skills-deficient; in the Christensen and Arkowitz (1974) project, clients who participated in the intervention averaged 1.5 dates during the 12-day assessment before the practice dating took place. We might assume that these individuals had reasonable dating histories but still experienced some 168 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions improved behavioral ratings of client social skill, decreased anxiety during simulated interactions with an opposite-sex confederate, and frequency of actual dates. In contrast to the group-training projects of Curran and his associates, Twentyman and McFall (1975) utilized an intervention consisting ofindividual client treatment. All clients were males who were \"shy\" and who dated infrequently. Pretreatment assessment included several simulated interactions with a female confederate, including a semistructured 5-minute conversation such as might take place between the client and a woman who sits next to him in class. Observers rated the client\\'s anxiety and interpersonal skill during the conversation. Physiological recordings were made of the client\\'s pulse-rate during the simulated interactions to obtain an additional measure of anxiety independent of client self-report. All clients also completed the Survey of Heterosexual Interactions questionnaire. Clients were randomly assigned to either individual heterosocial-skills trainingorno-treatmentcontrolcondition. Eachtrainingsessionutilizedamodeling tape recording to demonstrate effective social skills in heterosocial interactions, instructions and coaching provided by the therapist, and behavior rehearsal with a female confederate. Behavior rehearsal in each session was repeated whenever the client was unhappy with his fIrst rehearsal performance. Twentyman and McFall (1975) focused training on several different date-related interactions. For example, one session particularly stressed the use ofeffective skills when telephoning someone for a date. Other sessions addressed the exhibition of appropriate skill-components during face-to-face interactions. In-session behavior-rehearsal was tailored to the type of situation receiving attention that day; for example, when telephone skills were taught, rehearsal consisted ofrole-play phone calls with the female confederate on the other end of the telephone line. At the conclusion of each client\\'s training, the simulated interactions with confederates used prior to treatment were repeated. Additionally, clients main-tained self-monitoring diaries of their interactions with women for one week before, and again one week after, the intervention. Twentyman and McFall (1975) found, when compared to clients who received no treatment, that those in skills-training were: (1) rated as more skilled and less anxious during their posttraining interactions; (2) showed reduced pulse rate after the intervention; (3) had increased heterosocial ~tivity in the natural environment based on their diary entries; and (4) achieved greater improvement in scores on the Survey of Heterosexual Interactions. Each of the above-mentioned projects has demonstrated that social-skills training, whether conducted with individual clients or group-administered, can improve the heterosocial skills and decrease the heterosocial anxiety of interpersonally defIcient clients. In addition to the interventions we have just reviewed, investigations have focused attention on other treatment elements Training for Date-Initiation and Other Heterosocial Skills 167 ways. These included intensifying the treatment intervention to 8 weekly sessions, each of 9O-minutes\\' duration; examining changes in actual client dating frequency as a result of training; and obtaining follow-up data 6 months after training to evaluate the intervention\\'s dUfability. Clients in the skillstraining group received training on components similar to those in Curran (1975), with the addition of \"asking for a date\" and \"handling silences.\" BcMh males and females were in the group and each 9O-minute session focused on one or two components. Curran and Gilbert (1975) report that within eadl session, instruction and discussion of that day\\'s targeted component b,-tile co-therapists lasted 10-15 minutes. A 10-to IS-minute modeling v~ was shown, followed by a 30-to 4O-minute period for each client\\'s behavior rehearsal within the group session. In the rehearsal, clients used the taraeted component during short practice interactions with one another, and recei_ feedback plus reinforcement from the therapists and the other group me.hers who observed the practice. Finally, sessions ended with clients presenting specific information about in-vivo heterosocial interactions in which they hIId used their newly acquired skills during the previous week. This information was obtained by providing recording diary-forms each week and having clients record all relevant situations on a daily basis. Additionally, the cHeats were asked to bring their recordings to the group sessions, where both the thel\\'llpilU and the other clients reinforced reports ofclients using appropriate slrilk ill.. natural environment. Curran and Gilbert (1975) found that clients who received this skills-training intervention and clients who received systematic desensitization for dMiRg situations both demonstrated significantly greater reduction in anxiety by the end of training than control-group clients who received no intervention; .is anxiety-reduction effect was shown for both self-report measures and f observer ratings of anxiety exhibited by clients during their semistruCSlH\\'ed interactions with opposite-sex confederates. During the posttraiDing interactions, clients receiving skills-training were rated as more skillful than COftIlWlI group clients; when follow-up practice interactions were repeated 6 tnGlIIfths aftertheintervention, the skills-traininggroupwasevaluated byjudgesasmore competent than clients who had received either systematic desensitization er110 treatment. Increased dating was found among clients who received betierolO-cialskills training and systematic desensitization. In a similar study, Curran, Gilbert, and Little (1976) compared a heteroIocial-skills training intervention with a sensitivity-training procedure ofc0mpa-rable intensity. The skills-training group was handled in the same ~as Curran and Gilbert (1975). However, because most clients were males, female confederates attended the skills-training group sessions to serve as p8ItBerS during the practice or rehearsal interactions that occurred as a part of each session. This project found that the skills-training intervention was assoeiated with improvement on a number ofself-report measures ofheterosocial anxiety, 166 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions others). Since our present objective is to review several representative clinical studies on skills-training, attention will be focused on projects that principally utilized this treatment approach and which have the greatest potential for application in direct-service settings. Curran and his associates have conducted a series ofstudies investigating the effectiveness of heterosocial-skills training. One of the earlier projects involved a comparison of group skills-training with systematic desensitization and no treatment (Curran, 1975). Clients in this study were male and female collegestudents, many ofwhomhadahistory ofminimaldating ornoprevious dates at all. Before the intervention phase, all clients completed the Situation Questionnaire (Rehm & Marston, 1968) and a social-fear inventory. Each client also engaged in an individual semistructured interaction with an opposite-sex confederate. In this 3-minute interaction, clients were asked to imagine that they were waiting for their order at a pizza parlor during a first date with the confederate. The client was instructed to converse with the partner as though he or she were in that situation; the confederate partner always provided brief, neutral responses and allowed the client to maintain conversational initiative. Observers rated each client\\'s performance in this sample interaction on 7-point scales for interpersonal skill and social anxiety. Clients in the skills-training group received a total of six 75-minute training sessions spaced over a 3-week period. Two graduate-student therapists led each group session. Some of the component-behaviors targeted for treatment included giving and receiving compliments, listening skills, feeling talk (selfdisclosures), assertion, and nonverbal communication. For each component, the therapist provided instruction and presented a modeling videotape showing the correct use of that behavior. Clients then engaged in a behavior-rehearsal interaction to practice the component. Because both male and female clients were in the group, clients served as opposite-sex rehearsal partners with one another. Group and videotape feedback were used following the practice interactions. Homework assignments to practice each skill-component, and attention to increasing physical attractiveness were also included in the intervention. Clients assigned to the systematic desensitization group received a comparable amount of treatment attention, with the procedure aimed specifically towards reducing heterosocial anxiety. Control-group clients received either no treatmentoran attention-placebotreatment ofrelaxation training nottargeted to date-related situations. Curran (1975) found that while clients who had been randomly assigned to the treatment and control groups did not differ on any pretreatment measures, both the skills-training and the desensitization clients were rated as lower in anxiety and higher in social competence when semistructured interactions with confederate partners were repeated at posttreatment. Control-group clients did not show improvement. Curran and Gilbert (1975) elaborated the Curran (1975) project in several Training for Date-Initiation and Other Heterosodal Skills 165 Friend, 1969, described in Chapter 6). Although the items comprising each of these inventories do not specifically inquire about clients\\' date-initiation or heterosocial functioning, SAD and FNE scores have been shown to differentiate between high-and low-frequency daters, to correlate with other measures of heterosocial anxiety, and to change as a result of date-initiation training. (See Arkowitz, 1977, for a summary of this research.) Representative Date-Initiation Training As we noted earlier, most research on heterosocial-skills training has been conducted with college students who report difficulties in this area (lowfrequency dating, anxiety when interacting with persons of the opposite sex, and so on). Studies that have used social-skills training procedures have often compared this treatment approach to other types of intervention (no-treatment control, systematic desensitization, reflective therapy, sensitivity training, or You are at the student union or local cafeteria where friends your age eat lunch.

It is scored in a manner similar to the males\\' version of the Survey of Heterosexual Interactions, with low total scale scores indicative of self-reported inability to effectively handle the surveyed situations; high scores indicate that the respondent has little trouble handling the situations described by inventory items.

As was the case for rating general conversational skills in Chapter 6, the therapist evaluating a client\\'s heterosocial competence during practice interactions may fmd that other identifiable aspects of performance will require treatment attention. These might be undesirable behaviors or characteristics such as negative self-disclosures, speech dysfluencies, or long periods of silence. Such behaviors can also be rated from sample interactions to determine theirrate ofoccurrence, thereby allowing the therapist toevaluate improvement over the course ofthe intervention. Similarly, any other desirable heterosocial components (beyond those listed in Figure 7.1) that the therapist wishes to initially assess and later train can be added to the rating form. Self-Report Inventories and Heterosocial Skills There are a number of client self-report inventories that can be used in date-initiation training interventions. As we have stressed earlier, self-report measures cannot provide the therapist with the sufficiently detailed behavioral information that is needed to develop an intervention that identifies and targets a given client\\'s specific heterosocial deficits. However, inventories can be appropriately used: (1) in conjunction with behavioral-skills assessment to more completely conceptualize the nature of a client\\'s pretreatment heterosocial functioning; (2) to indirectly assess the client\\'s pretreatment anxiety, self-appraisals, frequency of heterosocial interactions, or fears related to dating; (3) to serve as a preliminary screening device when many clients are being screened prior to more thorough heterosocial-skills assessment and training; and (4) as one of the measures used to evaluate the effectiveness of a skills-training project, such as when the measure is administered before and after the intervention. The Situation Questionnaire (Rebm & Marston, 1968) consists of 30 descriptions of situations related to heterosocial functioning and requires that the respondent indicate the amount ofdiscomfort that would be experienced in eachbymeans ofa7-pointscale. Thecontent ofthescaleitemsis suchthatthe Situation Questionnaire is appropriate only for male clients. Investigations by Curran and his associates (Curran, 1975; Curran & Gilbert, 1975; Curran, Gilbert, & Little, 1976) have demonstrated that client discomfort, as assessed by this inventory, decreases as a function of heterosocial-skills training. The Survey of Heterosexual Interactions (Twentyman & McFall, 1975) also lists a variety ofheterosocial situations and asks the male respondent to rate on a 1 to 7 scale the degree to which he is able to handle each of them. Figure 7.2 presents the 20 items comprising the sm. Because the poorest skill 158 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions specific time and place for the date activity (Curran, 1975; Curran et al., 1976). It is important for a skills-training therapist to recognize that the specific act of asking for a date occurs within the context (and towards the conclusion) of a more extended heterosocial interaction. For example, it would almost certainly be inappropriate for a client to approach opposite-sex persons and immediately ask them for dates, since some period of heterosocial interaction or conversation will ordinarily precede a date request. Further, the social skill exhibited by the client during conversation preceding an actual date request will influence how the other person responds to the request to date. For these reasons, it is useful that during any practice interaction, a client be instructed not to ask for a date until some fixed period of time has elapsed (e.g., 10 minutes of simulated interaction). During the period before the actual date request, the client would use the heterosocial components just summarized; when the predetermined interval has elapsed, the client would then specifically ask for a date. The quality and appropriateness of the actual date-request component behavior are evaluated with respect to whether the client conveys the wish to date, solicits information on the partner\\'s willingness, and proposes a specific activity, time, and place. Heterosocial-Skill Assessment Procedures Rating Client\\'s Sample Heterosociallnteractions for Skill-Components Just as for other types of social skill, one of the preliminary objectives in an intervention focusing on heterosocial skills is assessing the degree to which a client exhibits each component-behavior during a sample interaction that the therapist can observe. Since date-initiation involves an interaction with an opposite-sex person, the conversationalpartnerwill needtobe someone ofthe opposite sex from the client\\'s. In general, a semistructured or unstructured interaction format of fixed duration (8 minutes, 10 minutes, etc.) is used. The same interaction format (conversing with an opposite-sex confederate) can be used as a vehicle for skill practice in training sessions throughout the intervention. A sample form that can be used by the therapist to rate a client\\'s heterosocial or date-initiation skill is presented in Figure 7.1. Two of the behavioral components, eye contact and affect, are assigned an overall rating score based on the client\\'s overall exhibition of them during the entire interaction period. Specific, discrete verbal components (questions, self-disclosures, compliments, etc.) can be most feasibly evaluated by determining the frequency with which each occurs over the sample interaction period. Speech duration is a stopwatch-timed measure, assessed by determining the total cumulative number of seconds that the client was speaking. Deficits found in any component during pretraining assessment interactions provide the therapist with informaTraining for Date-Initiation and Other Heterosocial Skills 157 Self-disclosing statements are comments made by the client that convey information about interests, activities, feelings, and so on to the partner. \"I was raised in Ohio\"; \"My favorite sport is swimming\"; or \"I went to Florida last winter\" are examples of self-disclosing comments. Both questions and selfdisclosures can be rated during a client\\'s assessment or practice interaction by counting the total number of times each occurs during the entire interaction. Complimentary comments. Several investigations of heterosocial skill have taught persons to direct compliments to the confederate with whom they interacted in practice situations (see Curran, 1975; Farrell, Mariotto, Conger, Curran, & Wallender, 1979; Wessberg, Mariotto, Conger, Farrell, & Conger, 1979). Examples of compliments might include \"You\\'re a very nice person\"; \"That\\'s a pretty outfit you are wearing\"; or \"You really handled that problem well.\" Follow-up or acknowledgment statements. A relatively subtle but potentially important verbal component is use of follow-up statements, which convey acknowledgment of what the other person just said. This component has been identified by Barlow et al. (1977) and is similar to a behavior described by Minkin et al. (1976). A follow-up or acknowledgment statement serves to communicate to the partner that the client has heard, understands, or approves of something the partner said. Follow-up statements can be brief comments (\"Yeah,\" \"Oh,\" \"That\\'s really something\"), or they can be somewhat longer statements that paraphrase what the partner has just said. Functionally, these verbalizations create the impression that the client is attending to the partner and is interested in the other person, and they follow the partner\\'s remarks. These behaviors can be rated by tallying their total frequency over the course of the sample interaction. Requestfor a date. Obviously, a key element in date-initiation training is the actual behavior of asking the other person for a date. Most investigatorS have defineda date as a prearranged social contact with a person ofthe opposite sex; this is in contrast to unplanned heterosocial contacts, which might themselves serve as opportunities to bring about future dates. It is somewhat surprising that within the heterosocial or date-initiation training literature, there has been relatively little attention given to either specifically defming appropriate behaviors that can be used when asking for dates or to teaching this importantaspect ofheterosocialinitiation. However, anappropriaterequestfor a date should include verbal statements indicating: (1) that the client would like to see the other person again: (2) an inquiry as to whether the other person would also like to meet again; (3) some indication of the planned date activity (e.g., getting a pizza, going to a show, studying together); and (4) offering a 156 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions client sample interactions. Components that were discussed in the previous chapter will not be described in great procedural detail here. Eye contact. An eye contact rating can be defined as the ratio of time when the clientlooksatthe face ofthe interaction partnertothe time when theclientis actively conversing with the partner (client speaking to the partner or partner speaking to the client). Affect. Just as for general conversational skill, affect refers to the emotional responsiveness or emotional appropriateness of the client\\'s interaction style. It can be most easily rated when the therapist assigns a numerical score (such as ona7-pointscale)torepresenttheclient\\'soverallaffect. Some ofthebehaviors that contribute to high affective ratings in date-initiation interactions might include appropriate smiles (Bander et aI., 1975; Heimberg et al., 1980); head nods (Bander et al., 1975; Greenwald, 1977); voice quality in terms of pitch, loudness, and flow (Barlow et al., 1977); facial expression in accord with the situation and with the partner\\'s expression (Barlow et al., 1977); and laughter (Barlow et al., 1977). Speech duration. This component denotes the total length of time that the client spends talking during the simulated interaction; it is usually measured by activating a stopwatch whenever the client is speaking. Either extremely low or excessively great speech-duration could be indicative of social-skill inadequacies. As in the case of general conversational skills, client speech-duration often serves as a corollary measure of social-skill, since it will reflect improvement when the client acquires and exhibits new, appropriate verbal component behaviors. Conversational questions and self-disclosing statements. Both of these verbal components are defined in heterosocial interactions just as they are during ordinary conversations. A conversational question refers to any interrogative comment that the client directs to the interaction partner and that results in the partner\\'s conveying information about interests, behavior, activities, or feelings. Several investigators have suggested that clients should particularly include the word \"you\" when asking questions during heterosocial interactions (e.g., \"Where do you go to school?\"); by asking \"you\" questions to an interaction partner, the client will be conveying personal interest and attention to the other person (Kupke, Calhoun, & Hobbs, 1979; Kupke, Hobbs, & Cheney, 1979). Additionally, client comments that are not directly phrased as questions but that nonetheless function as conversational questions can. be counted in this category (Minkin et al., 1976). These might include statements such as: \"Tell me more about that\"; \"I\\'d be interested in hearing more about what you did then\"; or \"So you went to a show last night.\" Training for Date-Initiation and Other Heterosocial Skills ISS ments in campus newspapers or self-report screening measures of infrequent dates and heterosocial anxieties. At the same time, heterosocial-skills training might logically be used with many client populations other than college students. It would appear that persons of high school or even junior high school age may experience great discomfort or social ineptness in date-related situations and would be appropriate clients for this form of skills-training. Regardless of their age, individuals present in mental health or counseling centers with problems associated with dating or establishing heterosocial relationships should be evaluated to assess their need for training. These clients may include persons who have recently become divorced or who have terminated long-term relationships and seem motivated but unable to establish new relationships. Successful dateinitiation can also be severely problematic for some mentally retarded individuals, as well as persons who have previously been institutionalized and now seek to establish relationships with opposite-sex persons. In these latter cases, specific heterosocial deficits may exist within the general context of deficiencies across a variety of other interpersonal skills. Components of Heterosocial Skill: Behavioral Definitions As in the previous chapter, we will first define the behavioral components that have been associated with competence in heterosocial interactions. Then procedures will be discussed for rating client sample or practice interactions for these behaviors. Self-report inventories ofheterosocial skills will also be considered. Behaviors that have been specifically related to skill in date-initiation or heterosocial interactions include: eye contact; affect, including smiles, voice quality, facial expression, head nods, appropriate laughter; duration of speech; conversational questions; self-disclosing statements; complimentary comments; follow-up or acknowledgment statements; and requesting a date. In addition to these desirable components, investigators have associated a number of behaviors with unskilled or anxious performance in heterosocial interactions. Such unskilled behaviors, ifpresent in pretraining assessment, should be reducedastheinterventionproceeds. Theyinclude: silencesinexcess of5to 10 seconds (Bander, Steinke, Allen, & Mosher, 1975; Barlow, Abel, Blanchard, Bristow, & Young, 1977; Martinez-Diaz & Edelstein, 1980); negative-opinion statements (Heimberg, Madsen, Montgomery, & McNabb, 1980; Twentyman & McFall, 1975); speech dysfluencies, such as \"00,\" or \"ah\" (Heimberg et al., 1980; Twentyman & McFall, 1975); and long or delayed latencies of response before the client begins speaking following the partner\\'s last comment (Martinez-Diaz & Edelstein, 1980; Williams & Ciminero, 1978). We will now tum ourattention to behavioral definitions ofthose components that comprise effective heterosocial skills and techniques for assessing them in 154 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions attractiveness itself and found high attractiveness ratings strongly associated with a higher frequency of dating interactions (Berscheid & Walster, 1973). As Curran (1977) points out, it is likely that difficulties during heterosocial or dating situations are multidetermined, with all four factors potentially contributing to impaired functioning. Further, while one individual may date infrequently because of inadequate behavioral skills, another client might have an adequate skills repertoire but experience extreme conditioned heterosocial anxiety and therefore avoid dating interactions. Applied interventions, which include treatment elements such as those described in Chapter 4, can address a variety ofthe problems experienced by low-frequency daters or heterosocially anxiouspersons. Forexample, social-skillstrainingitselfincreasestheacquisition and use of appropriate behaviors in heterosocial situations. Because training includes repeated exposure to practice interactions, the intervention may also serve a desensitization or anxiety-reduction function (see Arkowitz et al., 1978; Curran, 1977). Using thought-modification procedures to reduce negative self-evaluations and to increase cognitions that facilitate social performance addresses the cognitively mediated aspects ofheterosocial anxiety or dating-inhibition. Finally, assisting clients in planning opportunities to use newly acquired skills in the natural environment and reinforcing their report of skills usage also serve to desensitize them to the in-vivo performance ofdating and heterosocial skills. Client Populations with Whom Date-Initiation or Heterosocial Skills Training Has Been Used Virtually all applications of date-initiation or heterosocial skills-training reported in the research literature have used college students as clients. Of the studies considered in two major review papers (Arkowitz, 1977; Curran, 1977), only one project concerned date-initiation training with clients other than college students-Marzillier, Lambert, & Kellett, 1976; in this study, socially inadequate psychiatric outpatients were treated. Several conversational-skills training interventions utilizing opposite-sex confederate practice partners have been described (Urey et al., 1979; Kelly, Urey, & Patterson, 1980); however, they were not specifically intended to increase dating behavior and were considered in the previous chapter on conversational skills. One reason that college students have frequently been selected as a population to receive date-initiation training is that dating concerns often represent a genuineand\"real-life\"source ofdifficultyforthem; thisisincontrasttotheuse of college students as analogue \"patients\" in other types of treatment studies. Some investigators have conducted date-initiation training for students seeking assistance from a university counseling center (Martinson & Zerface, 1970), but low-frequency daters have more typically been located using advertiseTraining for Date-Initiation and Other Heterosocial Skills 153 3. Affectionate, heterosocial motor behavior. This might include such actions as touching or holding hands while interacting during a dating situation. 4. The sexes of the persons involved in the interaction. Heterosocial skills refer specifically to interactions between opposite-sex persons, especially in the context of the intention to date. Even these characteristics do not always differentiate date-initiation from general conversational skills. For example, highly affectionate verbal content statements or motor behaviors may be appropriate in an established heterosocial relationship between two persons. The same behaviors might be quite inappropriate during the initial meeting between two people who have not yet actually dated. Anxiety is frequently associated with date-initiation behavior, even among clients who can effectively handle everyday conversations that are not in the contextofdating. Thisappears to occur for a variety of reasons, which include most individuals\\' desire to establish heterosocial relationships; the social importance and status associated with dating; the fact that dating is a social skill that emerges relatively late in development and, therefore, is not based on an extensive set of personal learning experiences earlier in life; and the relationship between dating and heterosexual involvement, with the latter also being a potential source of anxiety, especially in adolescence. Difficulty in establishing dating and heterosocial interactions appears to be a relatively frequent problem. Arkowitz, Hinton, Perl, and Himadi (1978) report that 31 % of 3,800 randomly selected college undergraduates evaluated themselves as \"somewhat\" to \"very\" anxious about dating, and 50% of that population expressed interest in a dating-skills training program. Four models have been used to account for why clients exhibit anxiety or skill-performance deficits in heterosocial interactions. These include conceptualizations that stress client social-skill deficits, conditioned anxiety, negative cognitive self-evaluations, and personal attractiveness (See Arkowitz, 1977; Arkowitz et al., 1978; Curran, 1977). The social-skills deficit model assumes that an individual lacks the interpersonal behaviors needed to perform effectively during heterosocial interactions, with anxiety developing as a result of past rejection or inadequate social performance. As elaborated by Arkowitz et al. (1978), the conditioned-anxiety model postulates that heterosocial anxiety develops as a result of the classical conditioning of fear or anxiety with date-related situations, in a manner analogous to phobic responses. Cognitive models stress the causal relationship ofnegative self-evaluations to subsequent heterosocial anxiety; sources of negative self-evaluation might include excessively high performance standards, anxiety-related cognitions, selective recall of unsuccessful past experiences, and so on (Glasgow & Arkowitz, 1975; Arkowitz, 1977).Finally,someresearchershaveexaminedtherole ofpersonal Chapter 7 Training for Date-Initiation and Other Heterosocial Skills A very important goal for most people is establishing an intimate social and sexual relationship with some other person. The development of such intimate relationships requires that an individual first meet, converse with, and arrange for continued contacts with prospective dates. Those social competencies that bring about contact with opposite-sex persons are termed \"date-initiation\" or \"heterosocial\" skills. In a narrow sense, date-initiation refers to the actual behavior of asking another person to join in some prearranged social dating activity,while heterosocial skills refer to the more general abilities involved in maintaining conversations with someone of the opposite sex. However, in practice, these competencies are closely related, since the actual initiation or suggestion to go on dates almost invariably occurs within the context of heterosocial conversation between two people. Further, once a date has been arranged, the individuals must then utilize appropriate and effective heterosocial skills while engaged in the dating activity. As we will see, many of the behavioral competencies needed to initiate dates and relate effectively during interactions with opposite-sex persons are not fundamentally different than those that comprise general conversational skill. In fact, almost all of the specific behaviors that have been proposed as components of date-initiation or heterosocial competence are the same as those that have been postulated to make up conversational competence. The major differences between date-initiation and ordinary conversational behavior appear to include: l. The intent or purpose of the social interaction. Date-initiation behavior is intended specifically to bring about continued or future heterosexual or heterosocial contact with the other individual. 2. Verbal content aspects within the interaction. This includes demonstrable affectionate comments, statements expressing a desire to date in the future, comments regarding intimacy, and similar contents that would occur principally in the context of a heterosocial interaction and would be less appropriate during everyday conversation. 152 Conversational-Skills Training 151 are then rated in objective fashion to evaluate the extent to which the client exhibits those behavioral components associated with conversational skill. Training sessions successively target behaviors \"found to be deficient during pretreatment assessment interactions, and training sessions themselves utilize the learning principles described in Chapter 4. It is noteworthy that the studies summarized here were conducted in applied settings, such as mental health centers, developmental centers, and residential facilities. All of the interventions required fewer than 16 actual treatment sessions; the longest interventions occurred when treatment was groupadministered and when a large number of different components were taught. Although the number of therapists conducting training sessions was not always specified, the majority of studies used either one or two therapists; session length was generally less than one hour, including the time required for clients to engage in a short practice conversation each day. One important aspect of clinical treatment that has not been emphasized in research on conversational-skills training involves the enhancement of generalization. Although most of the abovementioned studies did use novel practice partners at some point during training, and although follow-up maintenance of skill-performance was assessed, systematic treatment efforts to promote generalization to the natural environment were not described. In an applied intervention, moreattentiontothiscriticalaspect oftrainingisneeded, andthetherapist should seek to incorporate specific generalization-enhancement techniques, such as those described in Chapter 4. Clients must not only develop and exhibit new skill behaviors during their practice conversations in the training setting, but they must then use these skills within the natural environment. 150 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions having the group observe two therapists conversing with one another while exhibiting the behaviors, and breaking the group up so that each client could have an individual practice conversation. Partners for the practice conversations were the therapists; all conversations were videotaped and feedback was provided in the session during which the girls and the therapists observed their perfonnance on tape. Throughout the study, clients were also required to engage in unstructured conversations with unknown adults. For these interactions, the therapist offered clients to cents each time they exhibited a targeted component, such as asking the novel partner a question. Thus, the therapists were incorporating not only praise as a positive reinforcer, but also tangible incentives for a client\\'s use of her newly acquired behaviors in conversation. Social validation of the training outcome was established by having 15 adults observe a series ofvideotapedconversations from the pretrainingand posttraining phases of the intervention. The naive judges rated the clients\\' overall conversational ability using 8-point scales. In all cases, client posttraining conversations received higher mean evaluations by the entire group of judges. Similar studies by Kelly, Wildman, Urey, and Thurman (1979) and Kelly, Urey, and Patterson (1980) used skills-training to improve the conversational repertoire of a group of ten retarded adolescents and a group of three formerly hospitalized psychiatric patients. Components receiving treatment attention included asking conversational questions, making self-disclosing statements, and making complimentary or reinforcing comments. Group training sessions in each of these projects were quite similar, with sessions including therapist examples and group discussion about that day\\'s behavioral component, a modeling videotape showing skilled conversationalists exhibiting the components, live-modeling both by the therapist and group members who observed one another\\'s practice verbalization of examples of the component, and feedback or reinforcement from the therapist and other group members. The effectiveness of treatment was further established by periodically utilizing novel conversational partners, conducting follow-up conversations after the intervention concluded, or having naive judges evaluate global conversational competence before and then after training. Issues from Conversational Skills-Training Research Literature Relevant to Applied Interventions Although the studies described above vary in several methodological points, they share a number of common features of interest to the applied practitioner who is planning a conversational-skills intervention. With respect to pretreatment assessment, client social competence is always evaluated using sample conversations between the client and some other person (a therapist confederate, anotherclient, orthetherapisthimselforherself). Assessmentinteractions Conversational-Skills Training 149 ate component-behaviors, training was conducted to increase the rate ofclients\\' statements disclosing personal information about themselves (termed \"informational facts\"), conversational questions, and \"social invitations.\" Social invitations were defined as statements suggesting that the partnerjointhe client in some shared activity (e.g., \"00 you want to play baseball sometime?\"). This component was derived from research on social competence showing that social invitations are related to peer popularity among children (Gottman, Gonso, & Rasmussen, 1975); it was trained because the two clients were in a school setting. Individual training sessions consisted of exposure to a modeling videotape, which showed two adolescents engaging in a conversation that included the same 13 standard comments that occurred in each client\\'s own practice conversations. The models exhibited all components that were to receive training attention. An adult therapist then coached the client in how to exhibit the behavior that was receiving attention in that session. Then the therapist left the room and the adolescent partner came in. The partner and the client had a practice conversation identical to that used in pretraining assessment. Ratings of each session\\'s practice conversation demonstrated that the clients more frequently exhibited the component in that day\\'s practice interaction. Additionally, in-vivo observations of the clients\\' free-time behavior conducted during recess at the school indicated that they increased the amount of time spent talking with others and playing with others after the intervention. Group Training of Conversational Skills Only a limited number ofgroup conversational-skills training studies have been reported in the clinical research literature. Those include projects by Minkin et al. (1976); Kelly, Wildman, Urey, & Thurman (1979); and Kelly, Vrey, & Patterson (1980). Minkinetal. (1976)taughtasmallgroup ofdelinquentfemaleadolescentsto exhibit two verbal components of conversational skill: directing appropriate questions to the other person in an interaction and providing \"positive conversational feedback\" (verbal acknowledgments or reinforcing comments) to the partner. These component behaviors were selected because each had been associated with global judgments of conversational competence among a normative sample of nondelinquent junior high school to college-age girls (Minkin et al., 1976). Prior to group training, clients individually engaged in several assessment conversations with previously unknown adult partners. Each conversation was unstructured, with both the client and the partner instructed only to talk with one another for four minutes. Training consisted of presenting all clients in the group with instructions and rationale, modeling of the targeted components by 148 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions assess whether the client exhibited the targeted component in his practice interaction, each practice conversation was always rated for all behavioral components. Thisprovidedamultiple-baselineanalysis oftreatmenteffectsfor each client. In addition to demonstrating that each client substantially increased his frequency of previously deficient skill-components, Urey et al. (1979) also videotaped conversations between each client and unfamiliar partners whom the client had never met before training; the videotapes were made immediately after the intervention and at 1-and 6-month follow-ups. Since clients exhibited the skill-components at higher than baseline rates in their conversations with novelpartnersoneachposttrainingoccasion, generalization oftrainingto novel partners was shown. To further socially validate the effect of treatment, the novel conversational partners who interacted with each client during pretrain-ing, posttraining, and at the follow-ups subjectively rated the client\\'s global conversational skill on dimensions including interest shown in her, genuineness of affect, eye contact, personal appearance, how interesting the client was during the conversation, etc. These confederate-partner ratings were made using lo-point scales immediately after each generalization conversation. Because the novel partners who made these ratings were aware that clients had received training between the pretraining and posttraining conversations and, consequently, may have been biased, other nonprofessional judges evaluated videotapes of each client\\'s pretraining and posttraining conversational competencies on the same global dimensions, using lO-point rating scales. These judges were naive as to whether a given videotaped conversation was before or after the intervention. Both the partners and the naive external judges always ratedtheposttreatmentinteractionshigheron subjective, global indices ofskill, thereby providing social validation of the training outcome. Kelly, Furman, Phillips, Hathorn, and Wilson (1979) reported the results of conversational-skills training with two moderately retarded adolescents, ages 13 and 20, with LQ. scores of 37 and 57, respectively. In this project, a somewhat different pretraining conversational-assessment procedure was employed. The partner who participated in the assessment interactions was a nonretarded adolescent. However, conversations were relatively structured, with the partner always including a set of 13 comments directed to the client in each conversation (for example, \"What did you do at school today?\"; \"You seem like a nice person\"; and \"There are a lot of games I like to play\"). Although the partner\\'s behavior was not confined to only these 13 comments, the standard comments were included in each conversation to ensure that the client always had an opportunity to ask the partner conversational questions~ or to self-disclose information about his own background and interests in response to the standard partner comments. Based upon two assessment conversations, which were videotaped and rated by the therapist for the presence of appropriConversational- Skills Training 147 Representative Conversational-Skills Training Interventions In this section, several representative studies of training in conversational skills will be reviewed. Because our main focus will be on applied treatment interventions, analogueresearch and studies thatutilized very brieftreatmentwill not be considered. Conversational-Skills Training with Individually Treated Clients Urey et al. (1979), in a preject noted in Chapter 3, conducted conversationalskills training with two formerly hospitalized male psychiatric patients. Both were enrolled in a mental health center\\'s aftercare program and both had been diagnosed as schizophrenic. The program staff recognized that the two clients appeared unable to maintain appropriate conversations with others, one because he appeared quite inappropriate in conversational conduct, and the other because of affective and social unresponsiveness. Because the clients reported experiencing the greatest difficulty during everyday interactions with females, training was targeted toward their conversational behavior with women. Pretreatment semistructured conversational assessment was conducted by rating 5-minute interactions between each client and a female conversational partner. Assessment conversations were repeated on three different days, were always videotaped, and were rated by the therapists to determine which component behaviors were deficient. Across all three assessments, each client consistently asked his partner few conversational questions (0 to 4 per 5-minute conversation), made few self-disclosures of appropriate personal information (0 to 6 such statements per conversation), and rarely offered any verbal acknowledgments or compliments (0 to 2). One client exhibited extremely flat affect (rated as a 1 on a 7-point scale); the other verbalized as many as 14 different disclosures of negative personal information in the 5-minute conversations. For one client, 9 individual training sessions were conducted; the other required 13 training sessions, due to his slower rate of skill-acquisition. The training sessions were themselves conducted in a manner almost identical to thatdescribedinChapter 4, withseveralsessionsdevotedtoeachbehaviorthat had been deficient in the assessment interactions. Brief instruction, examples, and a rationale for the component behavior were described; then, a modeling videotape was shown. The film portrayed two skilled persons interacting in conversation as though they had never previously met one another. Immediately after the modeling exposure, the client engaged in a 5-minute semistructured practice conversation, which was videotaped. Feedback and verbal reinforcement were provided as the therapist and client together reviewed the videotape of the client\\'s just-completed practice conversation. In order to objectively Assertiveness-Training 175 training to increase the supervisors\\' capacity to recognize and commend desirable behavior among employees would result in a better working relationshiprand employment environment at the company. The use of commendatory assertiveness is certainly not limited to interactions occurring in the work setting. Commendatory skills are appropriate whenever a client feels positively about some aspect of another person\\'s behavior and wishes to express it. At least two beneficial outcomes can be derivedfrom theuse ofeffectivecommendatoryassertion. First,aclientwillbe in a position to actually modify the behavior of others by actively and directly reinforcing their positive behavior. Since many clients do not perceive themselves as having the capability to influence other people in this way, training can add an important skill to the individual\\'s behavioral repertoire. Second, because most people appreciate receiving genuine expressions of positive recognition from others, it is likely that the client\\'s own reinforcement value to them will be increased by virture of this response capability. Client Populations for Refusal-Assertion Many early reports of refusal-assertion training described the treatment of socially passive college students. However, this form of skills-training has been extended to an extremely wide range of clinical populations as well. Although it would be virtually impossible to catalogue the many client groups for whom refusal-assertion training has been used, they include students seeking assistance from university counseling centers, chronic psychiatric inpatients of various diagnoses, formerly institutionalized schizophrenics, mental health center outpatients, unassertive adolescents, specialized women\\'s groups, and so on. In addition to these types of client populations, refusalassertion training procedures have also been adapted for much more specialized problems. Examples include teaching former alcoholics to refuse offers of drinks made by other people, teaching predelinquent adolescents to assert themselves when they are interacting with peers and might otherwise become involved in further antisocial acts, and assisting retarded persons to handle situations where they could be abused or exploited. While the selection criteria used to determine whether clients need refusal-assertion training vary enormously across treatment studies, they have generally included: a client\\'s own reports of passivity in situations where the client wishes to be more assertive and forceful; staff observations that indicated that the client behaves unassertively in a hospital, clinic, or school setting; or inferences made by a therapist from interview data that a client\\'s current mood or interpersonal distress was a consequence of that person\\'s failure to handle situations assertively. An interesting exception to the pattern ofusing refusal-assertion training for 176 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions clients who are extremely passive is the application ofthis treatment for highly explosive or aggressive individuals (see Foy, Eisler, & Pinkston, 1975; Frederiksen, Jenkins, Foy, & Eisler, 1976; Frederiksen & Kelly, 1977). It appears that some clients handle troublesome situations or frustrations in an explosive manner because they do not have the skills to deal with interpersonal conflict in a more appropriately assertive fashion. Indeed, some clients who \"explode\" in violent rage characteristically appear to be quite passive and unexpressive, except for their occasional episodes of extreme anger. It is possible that if such individuals can be taught the assertive skills needed to appropriately handle and resolve everyday conflicts, their extremes of social passivity and periodic explosiveness could be moderated. Another client group that has received a good deal of recent attention in the refusal-assertion training literature is women. Historically, sex-role stereotypes have associated assertiveness, the expression of opinions, leadership, and decision-making competencies with masculinity. Traditional feminine roles have stressed submissiveness, self-subordination, emotionality, and nurturant characteristics. Early-life socialization experiences and later sex-role expectations have probably restricted many females\\' opportunities to learn and exhibit appropriate refusal-assertion skills, since assertiveness is not a quality that has been highly reinforced among women; investigators have generally found females to be less assertive than males (see Bloom, Coburn, & Pearlman, 1975; Hollandsworth & Wall, 1977). However, as a result of new social developments-which include issues raised by the feminist social-political movement; less rigid sex-stereotyping in educational, training, and employment practices; and increased opportunities and expectations for women to occupy roles that require more forceful social skills-there has been increased attention focused on assertion-training for females. In summary, refusal-assertiveness training has been successfully used with an extremely wide range of client groups. These include inpatient, residential, and outpatient populations. Clients who are relatively low-functioning, such as chronic psychiatric patients, and clients who are relatively high-functioning but experience difficulty asserting themselves in certain situations can derive benefit from this form of skills-intervention. Regardless of the population, a key element ofrefusal-assertion training is making certain that the intervention identifies and targets situations known to be relevant for a particular client or group of clients. Client Populations for Commendatory~AssertionTraining A number of clinicians have pointed out the importance of commendatory assertive behaviorand have distinguished it from refusal assertion (Eisler etal., 1975; Hersen, Eisler, & Miller, 1973; Lazarus, 1971; Wolpe, 1969). However, Assertiveness-Training 177 there has been relatively less use of specific commendatory-assertion training reported in the applied literature and it appears that most assertiveness training has focused upon either refusal skills alone or refusal and commendatory skills together. One project described the treatment of a highly anxious patient who was very unreinforcing during interactions with his family and with co-workers at work (Kelly at al., 1978). Bellack, Hersen, and Turner (1976) also taught hospitalized psychiatric patients both refusal and commendatory skills in an effort to increase each variety of their expressive social behavior. In spite of the relative paucity of populations for whom commendatory training has actually been used, this technique would appear applicable for many client groups. The main criteria for training include a client\\'s inability to respond to positive behavior from others, as well as difficulties in interpersonal relationships that can be attributed to the person\\'s failure to initiate or communicate warm, affectionate responses. For clients who appear deficient in both refusal and commendatory-assertion skills, a single intervention might consolidate training for both of these competencies. Assertion-Skills Assessment In contrast to behavioral assessment of conversational or heterosocial skills, which evaluates client performance during extended semistructured or unstructured sample interactions, assessment of assertiveness generally involves the rating of client skill during more structured role-plays. Because the format for staging assessment role-plays was discussed in Chapter 3, it will not be repeated in detail here. However, the scenes used in any client role-play assessment should represent approximations or samples of situations that the client has actually found troublesome in the past or will need to handle effectively in the future. As we noted in Chapter 3, role-play scenes consist of three parts: (1) a narrated \"background\" description of the situation that the client will be role-playing; (2) comments or prompts made by the role-play partner to the client; and (3) the client\\'s assertive responses made directly back to the partner. In refusal-assertion role-plays, the scene narration describes a specific situation in which the client is faced with unreasonable behavior from someone else; the partner\\'s comment to the client is that which the antagonist would make. Forcommendatory-assertion role-plays, the narration describes a situation in which another person does something positive and the partner directs a positive remark to the client. In order to make role-play scenes more realistic, a scene might include several different partner comments, each of which requires the client\\'s response. For example, a refusal-assertion role-play might consist of two or three partner comments that escalate in unreasonableness, better testing the client\\'s assertion repertoire to deal with interpersonal conflict. Finally, assessment of client assertiveness before training, as well as 178 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions in practice during the course of treatment sessions, should be based on a number of different role-play scenes, rather than just a single, brief role-play interaction. Behavioral Definitions of Components ofAssertion In the behavioral evaluation of conversational and heterosocial skills, the interval during which the therapist observes the client\\'s skill is the entire semistructured or unstructured assessment interaction. For assertive role-plays, each response made by the client to a partner\\'s comment is studied by the therapist to determine the adequacy of behavioral skill-components. The components described below should therefore be present whenever the client makes an assertive response to the role-play partner. Refusal-assertion components are as follows: eye contact; affect; speech loudness; gestures; understanding statement or statement of problem; verbal noncompliance; request for new behavior or solution proposal; and speech duration. Commendatory assertion components are as follows: eye contact; affect; speech loudness; praise/appreciation statement; personal feeling statement; reciprocal positive behavior; speech duration. Let us now tum our attention to behavioral definitions for these components of skilled assertive responses, so that the therapist both can assess their presence during pretraining client role-plays and later teach them to the skillsdeficient individual. Refusal-Assertion Components Eye contact, affect, and speech loudness. As was the case for conversational and date-initiation competence, eye contact, appropriate affect, and sufficient speech loudness are also necessary components of refusal assertion. Eye contact represents the proportion of time that a client looks at the partner while speaking; if the client\\'s response to the partner\\'s comment is of approximately 10 seconds\\' duration, but eye contact was made for only about 2 seconds, the eye contact rating would be 20% and quite deficient. Firm affect is also a requisite of effective refusal assertion and can be rated for each client reponse using a 7-point scale. To be highly rated, the client\\'s emotional tone should be fmn, convincing, and appropriate to the conflict situation; extreme passivity and the lack of emotional firmness or, at the opposite pole, hostility and belligerence are examples of inappropriate affect. Finally, a speech loudness jUdgment can be made by the therapist also using a 7-point scale, with the ideal response spoken in a highly audible, clear manner. Assertiveness-Training 179 Gestures. Gestures, particularly those involving movement of the hand and arm while the client speaks, have also been proposed as a component of refusal assertion by many investigators. Gesturing is a nonverbal behavior that adds emphasis to the client\\'s assertive responses and conveys the appearance of greater ease while interacting. The therapist rating a client\\'s role-play response might define a gesture as hand or arm motion of at least six inches while the individual is speaking. Gestures can be counted as either present or absent in each role-play response made by the client to the partner. Understanding statement or statement ojproblem. In addition to nonverbal-content components, what are the verbal statements that should be present in a client\\'s refusal-assertion response? Several specific types of content components have been widely proposed as contributors to effective assertion. The first is a statement by the client that indicates the existence and nature of a conflict situation, or that conveys client recognition of the antagonist\\'s viewpoint. This can be termed an \"understanding statement\" or a \"statement of the problem.\" When a client begins an assertive response with a statement that communicates the nature of the conflict issue or the client\\'s awareness of the other person\\'s point of view, it can moderate the response so that it will not be perceived as aggressive and also convey empathic understanding to the antagonist (Mullinix & Galassi, 1978; Romano & Bellack, 1980; Woolfolk & Dever, 1979). It is important to note that an understanding statement of this type is not an apology, a self-deprecating comment, or an excuse for the antagonist\\'s behavior. Instead, it is a way to introduce the assertive response in a nonhostile fashion and ensure that the other person knows why the client is objecting. To illustrate an example of this component, we might consider a role-play of a situation at the job in which a co-worker consistently leaves work early. The client is then left to complete the co-worker\\'s responsibilities, and it is irritating to the client. An illustration of an understanding-statement component in the client\\'s role-play response would be if the client said to the partner, \"It\\'s almost quitting time and I know we both want to leave work for the day. However ...\" Similarly, a statement of the problem component would be included if the client said to the partner, \"I think we have a difficulty here because you\\'re always in a hurry to leave work and I have to cover your responsibilities....\" Any role-play response that includes such a comment made by the client can be rated by the therapist as demonstrating the presence of making an understanding statement. Noncompliance. It is also important that a refusal-assertion response include a statement expressing clear noncompliance or disagreement with the antagonist\\'s unreasonable behavior. A noncompliance statement is any verbalization that the other person\\'s behavior is unacceptable, unsatisfactory, or will 180 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions not be tolerated by the client. Examples of verbal noncompliance include: \"This is not acceptable to me\"; \"I am not willing to do that\"; \"I will not continue to handle things for you that you should be doing yourself\\'; \"You must stop that\"; and so on. Whenever a client makes an explicit statement indicating noncompliance or resistance to unreasonable actions from the role-play partner, this component is considered to be present in the response. Noncompliance is absent whenever the client capitulates to the unreasonable partner behavior or whenever the client fails to include a direct statement indicating noncompliance or resistance in a role-play response. Request/or new behavior or solution proposal. Ifa client only states the existence of a problem, conveys awareness of the antagonist\\'s position, and specifically indicates noncompliance with the other person\\'s actions, it still does not communicate what the client would like the partner to do differently in the future. Since one ultimate aim of a refusal-assertion response is to effect behavior change from an antagonist, it is also necessary for a client to suggest a more acceptable course of action for the antagonist to follow in the future. A request for new behavior or conflict-solution proposal can be distinguished from noncompliance in the sense that noncompliance only indicates that the actions of the other person are unacceptable, while the behavior-change request goes beyond this by communicating an acceptable alternative to the person. To better illustrate these verbal components of refusal assertion, let\\'s consider again the role-play of the situation where a client\\'s co-worker leaves work early, creating a situation where the client must cover his co-worker\\'s responsibilities. In a role-play of this situation, the scene might describe the antagonist about to leave the office a half-hour early. The role-play partner initiates: Partner: Good night, Charlie. I\\'ve got a busy evening planned and am going to leave a little early today. Client: We have a problem, Jack, because whenever you leave early, I have to cover things that come up in your absence {statement ofthe problem]. I know you would like to leave so you can get a head start on your plans for the night {understanding statement]. However, it isn\\'t reasonable for you to expect me to do your job for you and I am not willing to do this {noncompliance]. I\\'d like you to stay until all of our work is done, rather than leave early. That way, we can both finish faster {requestfor new behavior/solution proposal]. Ifthese comments had been observed in a client\\'s role-play, the therapist would score, as present in the response, each of the verbal behaviors constituting effective refusal-assertion. If this role-play response also includes good eye contact, reasonably loud speaking voice, and appropriately firm affect, the observer rating it will probably judge this to be an appropriately assertive response with respect to all component behaviors. As we have noted, any role-play scene can be extended by having the interaction partner direct several prompts or comments to the client, with the client responding to each of Assertiveness-Training 181 them. The therapist then rates each different response made by the client to assess the presence of skill-components. Speech duration. Duration of speaking has been widely identified as a component of refusal assertion, just as it was for the other types of social skill we have alreijdy considered. Speech duration may initally be too short, especially in skills-deficient individuals who do not know what to say in an assertive response. As new verbal skills are acquired over the course of treatment, increasing duration of replies should also be found. Ifthe therapist wishes to objectively assess whether or not this occurs, a client\\'s role-play responses can be timed in pretreatment assessment and then later in the intervention to determine change in this behavior. It is also possible that some clients will initially provide overly long, but nonetheless ineffective, assertive responses during role-plays. This could occur when the client talks excessively, circuitously, but without including the appropriate verbal components described above in a role-play response. In those cases, one would expect speech duration to decrease with training as the individual learns to make more succinct, clear, and direct remarks. Rating Client Refusal-Assertion Role-Plays for Skill-Components During the behavioral assessment of a client\\'s refusal-assertion skills, which precedes the training intervention, the therapist will construct a set of role-play scenes approximating troublesome situations that the client has encountered or will be encountering in the natural environment. In the pretreatment assessment phase, the client can be asked to role-play responses to each of the scenes with a confederate partner or, less desirably, the therapist playing the antagonist and delivering the prompt comments to the client. The therapist who observes the role-plays rates every client response for each of the behavioral components we have discussed. A sample rating-form, which can be used to evaluate the adequacy ofrefusal-assertion responses, was presented in Chapter 3. When the therapist has observed the client\\'s handling of the sample role-plays and has identified deficient verbal and nonverbal components, those behaviors can be targeted for particular attention in the assertive-training intervention itself. During treatment sessions, when the individual begins incorporating appropriate behaviors in his or her rehearsaVpractice role-plays, the therapist can use the same rating procedure to objectively analyze whether previously deficient components are now present in the practice role-play responses. Rating Client Commendatory-Assertion Components Eye contact, affect, and speech loudness. Just as these three nonverbal behaviors are rated in refusal-assertion role-plays, they are also components of commendatory skill and should be evaluated when clients role-play scenes 182 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions calling for commendatory assertion. Eye contact and speech loudness are rated in a fashion identical to refusal assertiveness. Affect in commendatory roleplays can again be judged by the therapist on a 7-point scale for each client response. \"Ideal\" commendatory affect should consist of a warm, friendly emotional tone; emotional responsiveness appropriate to the situation described in the role-play scene; the presence of smiles; and so on. Deficient dient affect is characterized by the absence of these behaviors. Praise/appreciation statement. This verbal component is scored as present in a role-play response if the client specifically praises the partner\\'s positive behavior and/or expresses appreciation to the partner for having engaged in some desirable behavior. Examples of praise/appreciation statements include any of the following kinds ofcomments in the role-play response: \"It was very nice of you to stay late and help me with this\"; \"I really appreciate you telling me that\"; \"That\\'s very nice of you\"; \"You did a fine job\"; and so on. In each of these comments, the client is verbally reinforcing the partner for having done something nice. Personal feeling statement. A second verbal component of a socially skilled commendatory response is conveying to the other person information about one\\'s own positive personal feeling that followed his or her desired action. This behavior is present if the client makes a statement to the other person such as: \"It made me feel very good when you did that\"; \"I have enjoyed knowing you and working withyoufor thepastyear\"; \"1\\'mveryproud ofyour accomplishment\"; or \"I feel very comfortable talking to you.\" This category of statement differs from a praise statement because it conveys information on one\\'s own internal feelings, rather than complimenting the behavior of the other individual. Reciprocal positive behavior. Within a client\\'s response, there can also be an offer to reciprocate the positive behavior shown by the other person at some time in the future. This can take the form of returning the other person\\'s favor, offering to assist the partner is some future task or activity, or doing something the other party is likely to appreciate. Examples of some reciprocal positive behavior statements that can occur in a commendatory situation are: \"IfI can ever do anything to help you out, let me know\"; \\'\\'I\\'d be glad to show you how I made this\"; \"Because you\\'ve been such a good employee, I want to put a merit citation in your file\"; or \"I\\'d like to return your favor by taking you out to lunch.\" Speech duration. The length of a client\\'s reply to the role-play partner\\'s positive comment has also been postulated as a component of effective commendatory skill. Just as in the case of refusal assertion, speech duration in Assertiveness-Training 183 commendatory assertion will ordinarily increase as a skills-deficient client learns to use the verbal content behaviors we have just reviewed. To illustrate how these verbal components can each occur and be rated in a client\\'s role-play performance, we might consider a scene in which a person has just returned from a week\\'s vacation. The weather was dry, and a neighbor had taken it upon himself to water the client\\'s newly planted garden. The role-play partner plays the neighbor and says to the client: Partner: It didn\\'t rain while you were gone, so I watered your plants for you. Client: It was really nice of you to water the garden for me [praise statement]. I worked pretty hard to plant it and it makes me feel good to have a neighbor as thoughtful as you [personal feeling statement]. Whenever you get ready to go on your vacation, let me know and I\\'ll be glad to look after your place too [reciprocal positive behavior]. In this sample client response, each verbal component of commendatory assertion was present. Thus, it constitutes a demonstr~tive and warm reaction to the other person\\'s positive action. To the extent that these verbal behaviors are missing, or the nonverbal components of adequate eye contact, loudness, and affect are absent in pretreatment role-plays, the therapist would identify them as deficiencies requiring training. During the behavior rehearsal or practice role-playing that occurs in later treatment sessions, the therapist can continue to evaluate client role-plays to determine whether the behaviors are exhibited. Figure 8.1 presents a sample form for rating commendatory assertion role-plays. Self-Report Measures of Assertiveness In conjunction with behavioral role-play assessment of a client\\'s assertion skills, a therapist may wish to utilize a self-report measure of assertiveness. This can be done as a part of the client\\'s pretraining skills-assessment, as well as later in the intervention to determine changes in the individual\\'s selfperceptions of assertive functioning. As we have noted previously, it is important that a self-report inventory never take the place of more specific interviewbased and behavioral assessment of social competency, since even wellconstructed assertiveness inventories do not provide the therapist with detailed information on the specific situations that are troublesome for a given client or on the client\\'s actual behavior within those situations. However, self-report scales do tap an important assessment domain, e.g., the client\\'s generalized self-description of assertiveness competencies, and can be a useful adjunct source of data on behavior-change following an intervention. Because assertion-training has received a great deal of attention, there have been a correspondingly large number of self-report inventories discussed in the literature. The items on most scales are intended to tap refusal-assertion 184 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions abilities, although some inventories also include questions about the respondent\\'s commendatory expressiveness. The following is a discussion ofthe three inventories most often used in recent assertion-training projects. Assertion Inventory Gambrill and Richey (1975) constructed an inventory of client assertiveness that consists of 40 brief situational descriptions and asks the client to indicate both degree of discomfort and likelihood of engaging in that situation. The authors suggest that this distinction may be of importance in treatment, with \"high-discomfort\" responders receiving particular training to increase their FIGURE 8.1. Sample Rating-Form for Commendatory Assertion Role-Plays Client N!Ul\\\\e\\' _ Date of This Inte3~ac\\'tion\\' _ Type of Interaction, Pretraining Assessment session Practice (Training Focused on What Component?

Speech Loudness 1 2 3456 extremely appropriate soft-spoken loudness and so as to be clarity inaudible 7 Assertiveness-Training 185 ease of expression and with \"assertive-avoidant\" persons perhaps requiring more work in basic-skills acquisition. Although these assumptions have not been specifically tested, the scale\\'s distinction between a client\\'s reported comfort and reported behavior in situations requiring assertiveness seems useful. As Figure 8.2 indicates, items in the Gambrill and Richey (1975) inventory concern both refusal and commendatory skill. Presumably, a therapist could examine responses to items ofeach type, depending upon whether an intervention was concerned with training refusal assertion, commendatory assertion, or a consolidation of the two. The client completing this scale uses a 1 to 5 rating todescribehimselforherself. Lowscoresonthe\"degree ofdiscomfort\"ratings indicate that the client is comfortable in situations in which he is required to be assertive. Low scores on the \"response probability\" ratings indicate a high likelihood of responding assertively. A client\\'s total scale score can range from 40 (extremely comfortable, extremely assertive) to 200 (extremely uncomfortable, extremely unassertive). Normative data from large samples of college undergraduates provided inventory means of 90 to 96 on the discomfort measure and 102 to 111 on the response-probability measure (Gambrill & Richey, 1975). While males and females in the normative sample gave comparable scores on the discomfort index, males in the normative sample described 4.

It is important to cover your discomfort ratings (locatea-In front of the items) while indicating response probability.

Limited reliability and validity data have been presented by the inventory authors, including the finding that scale scores change in the expected directions-less discomfort and more assertive-response probabilities following an assertion-training intervention (Gambrill & Richey, 1975). Because this measure taps a variety of situations and assesses both client anxiety and selfreported behavior, it appears to be an unusually comprehensive inventory of assertiveness. 7.

(continued) 188 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions Rathus Assertiveness Schedule Rathus (1973) developed a 30-item self-report measure of client refusalassertion. Because it largely does not tap situations where commendatory skills are needed, this inventory would not be relevant to that form of skills-training. When completing the Rathus Schedule, the client indicates the degree to which eachstatement itemis descriptive ofhisor herown behaviorusing acode of +3 (\"very characteristic of me\") to -3 (\"very uncharacteristic of me\"). Several sample items from the inventory are: \"1 have avoided asking questions for fear of sounding stupid\"; \"1 often have a hard time saying no\"; and \"Anyone attempting to push ahead of me in a line is in for a good battle.\" While the Rathus Assertiveness Schedule has a number of positive construction features, including item-keying to control for acquiescence and acceptable reliability, some investigators have suggested that its item-content reflects social aggression rather than appropriate assertiveness (see Galassi & Galassi, 1978; Twentyman & Zimering, 1979).

Tell a friend or someone with whom you work when he/she says or does something that bothers you. 40. Ask a person who is annoying you in a public situation to stop. Assertiveness-Training 189 College Self-Expression Scale (CSES) Galassi, Deleo, Galassi, and Bastien (1974) have also developed a self-report inventory of client assertiveness termed the College Self-Expression Scale. Composed of 50 items, the CSES taps refusal assertion, commendatory assertion, and what its authors term \"self-denial\" (overapologizing, excessive anxiety, exaggerated concern for how others feel, etc.). CSES items are phrased as questions: \"Would you exchange a purchase you discover to be faulty?\"; \"Is it difficult for you to compliment and praise others?\"; \"Are you overly careful to avoid hurting other people\\'s feelings?\" The client marks each with a number to signify his or her response, from 0 = always to 4 = never. The responses to all 50 items are summed to yield an overall assertiveness score, with some items reverse-keyed to control for acquiescence. Galassi et al. (1974) have provided data on the reliability and validity ofthe CSES, including correlations between assertiveness scores and scales of pen-and-pencil personality measures. However, for a sample of student teachers, there were only very modest correlations between CSES scores and observer (supervisor) ratings of the students\\' assertiveness. As elaborated in Chapter 5, this may be due to the fact that any assertion inventory samples a client\\'s general self-perceptions; these self-perceptions may not be highly consistent with the person\\'s actual behavior when it is more objectively, externally measured. Representative Assertion-Training Research Let us now tum our attention to several assertion-training projects, both with individually treated clients and groups. As in previous chapters, we will focus primarily on procedures used for client assessment and skills-training sessions that are relevant for applied practitioners. Assertion-Training with Individual Clients A study by Hersen and Bellack (1976) illustrates very clearly how assertivetraining can be conducted with individually treated clients. In this project, two patients were enrolled in a partial hospital program and had been diagnosed as schizophrenic. Staffobservations indicated that each was inte~rsonally withdrawn, nonsocial, and minimally responsive during traditional treatment activities such as group therapy or other scheduled activities. Because they appeared highly unassertive, the clients were selected for training in both refusal and commendatory assertion. Initial pretreatment assessment consisted of having each client role-play eight scenes with a confederate partner. Some of the scenes required refusal190 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions assertion skills, while others required commendatory behavior while interacting with the partner. Both male and female partners were used. Assessment role-plays were repeated on several occasions to establish a clear baseline before treatment began. Role-play performance was always evaluated by observers who notedthe presenceand adequacy ofbehavioral skill-components in the client\\'s responses. One client, for example, was found to be deficient in eye contact, and also in noncompliance with the partner\\'s unreasonable behavior, in requests for new behavior from the partner, and in adequate speech duration. The component deficits observed in each client\\'s pretreatment assessment role-plays were identified as those behaviors that would receive training attention. For each client, treatment sessions were held daily. One client\\'s daily sessions lasted 20 to 40 minutesfor a period ofabout4 weeks; the secondclient, described by Hersen and Bellack (1976) as more \"chronic,\" required slightly longer daily sessions for 5 weeks. In all sessions, the client was seated next to a role-play partner with whom he would be interacting. The therapist served as the trainer and also observed the client\\'s role-play practice with the partner. Sessions included: (I) instruction from the therapist on the behavioral component (eye contact, noncompliance, etc.) that would receive training attention that day; (2) observation of an indiyiduallive-modeling an effective assertive response, which included that component behavior; (3) a practice role-play, with the therapist narrating the scene description, the partner providing a prompt comment, and the client responding to it; and (4) feedback and corrective information provided by the therapist who observed the role-play. Whenever the client failed to correctly exhibit the targeted component in a role-play scene, the scene was repeated until improvement was evident and the next scene was then rehearsed. In every session, all 8 role-play scenes were always practiced, with feedback and instruction following each scene. For both clients reported in the Hersen and Bellack (1976) study, social-skill components received attention sequentially and cumulatively over the course of the intervention. For example, the first three treatment sessions after initial assessment focused upon increasing the client\\'s eye contact during role-plays. Later, other components also received attention (noncompliance, requests for new behavior, and speech duration for refusal scenes; affect, smiles, and so on for commendatory scenes). Approximately three sessions were devoted to each component. Throughout the intervention, the role-play practice scenes in each session were always rated to determine whether the client was effectively exhibiting the behavior that was being trained in that session. Because clients increased their use of a given component-behavior only when it was specifically targeted for training, the multiple baseline methodology demonstrated that treatment was responsible for improved skills during the practice role-plays. By the end of the intervention, and to a large degree at 2-month follow-up, clients Assertiveness-Training 191 were exhibiting all behavioral components in each role-play scene. Also, global ratings were made of the clients\\' overall assertiveness; these global judgments were substantially higher by the end of training. Foy, Massey, Duer, Ross, and Wooten (1979) used a similar assertivetraining procedure with three male clients in a short-term residential alcoholtreatment program. Each of the clients had experienced interpersonal difficulties at his job, and the nature of the difficulties suggested that the clients were unable to assert themselves appropriately when confronted with unreasonable behaviorfromothers. Anumber ofrole-playscenesweredeveloped tosimulate work situations that required refusal assertiveness; clients were asked to roleplay how they would normally handle each scene. One therapist served as the . role-play partner; an observer rated each role-play performance for the behavioralcomponents ofrefusal assertion. Therapistobservation ofthese assessment role-plays revealed deficits on a number ofrefusal-assertion components including noncompliance, requests for new behavior from the antagonist, eye contact, and speech duration. Global, subjective judgements of overall assertiveness, made on a I-to-5 scale, indicated that clients were also seen as unassertive in their overall impact during the role-plays. Individual training sessions in this project were quite brief, lasting 10 to 15 minutes, and any client\\'s entire intervention consisted of 9 to 12 sessions following the pretreatment assessment-phase. Components were introduced sequentially, with several training sessions devoted to each specific behavior. The Foy et al. (1979) study varied somewhat the way that each training session was conducted. In early sessions, the client was asked to simply observe a videotape that showed an assertive model handling the situations that the client would role-play in that session\\'s practice. However, no specific therapist instructions were given either before or after the film, and the client merely role-playedasceneimmediatelyafterthemodelingfilm ofitwasshown. When these client practice role-plays were rated, very little improvement was evident. Then, the therapists \"added\" instruction to the treatment session format, by directing the client to note how and when the model exhibited specific components of assertion. Additionally, the therapist described the target behaviors in detail and provided a rationale for each. When sessions included these elements oftreatment, client practice role-plays improved considerably, both in terms of the presence of specific skill behaviors and in overall, subjective ratings of the client\\'s assertiveness. Role-plays repeated 6 months after training showed that clients maintained their skill improvement. Other investigators have also examined variations in the type of assertivetraining given to indivdually trained clients. Edelstein and Eisler (1976), in a study similar to Foy et al. (1979), confirmed that watching a videotaped assertive model alone had little effect on a client\\'s performance in practice role-plays. However, the addition of detailed therapist instruction on how to 192 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions exhibiteachtargetbehavior, andthe provision offeedbackfollowingrole-play practice did result in improved perfonnance. Hersen, Eisler, Miller, Johnson, and Pinkston (1973) also found that the combination of modeling with instruction from the therapist was a more effective procedure than either modeling alone or instruction alone. These projects, representative of the large number ofindividual-client assertive-training interventions reported in the literature, suggest that an optimal format for assertive-training sessions includes instruction on a behavioral component, modeling exposure of some type, role-play rehearsal of a scene requiring assertiveness, feedback, therapist reinforcement, and corrective instruction if it is needed. Since a role-play scene is fairly brief even when it consistsofmultiplepartner-prompts andclientresponses, anumber ofdifferent scenes can be practiced within a single session. It would appear desirable for therapist instructions and feedback to be used for each role-play scene that a client practices in the session. When the client has successfully mastered one component behavior and exhibits it correctly during all role-play scenes, the next skill component can then be targeted for training in the intervention. Finally, while most projects teaching assertiveness to individual clients have focused on refusal assertion, the same training procedures have been used successfully for commendatory skills (Hersen & Bellack, 1976; Kelly, Frederiksen, Fitts, & Phillips, 1978; Turner & Adams, 1977). Here, role-play scenes simulate situations in which the client has the opportunity to respond to the positive behavior of the partner, and the behaviors trained in the intervention are components of commendatory skill. Generalization of Assertiveness to the Natural Environment Unfortunately, most research on assertive-training with individual clients, including the studies just reviewed, has given little attention to enhancing the generalization of skill-improvement to troublesome situations within the natural environment. All too often, studies have not even examined evidence of client behavior-change beyond the doors ofthe training clinic. As we discussed in Chapter 4, an intervention can be considered clinically successful only when clients are able to utilize their newly acquired skills within the context of naturally occurring social relationships outside the training setting. In that earlier chapter, a number of techniques for increasing the generalization of skills-training interventions were discussed. Let us consider how they can be incorporated specifically in assertive-training. Selecting relevant role-play scenes. Carefully selecting role-play scenes for assessment, and later for session practice, that are known to be relevant for a particular client is crucial. Research on assertion-training has often relied on a Assertiveness-Training 193 standardized \"inventory\" of role-play scenes, which is used for the training of any skills-deficient client. Although such standardization is useful for research consistency, an applied intervention should always tailor role-play situations to the needs and problems of a particular client. Ifthe situations used in training and practice closely approximate real problem-situations that the client will encounter, better generalization can be expected. Also, the role-play partner should behave, as much as possible, as the other person would if the situation occurred within the natural environment. Teaching general principles. Training should focus on teaching the client general principles rather than memorized or \"parroted\" verbalizations. Providing rationales for skill-components and encouraging a clientto generate personalized and novel examples of a skill-behavior are desirable, provided the client\\'s behavior captures the general principle being taught. Novel role-play scenes and partners should be used whenever possible to ensure that a client is not merely responding to highly specific cues associated with practice. Use of client self-monitoring. Client self-monitoring or diary data should be used in training. As discussed previously, the client can learn to be an observerofhisor herownbehaviorin the natural environmentbetween training sessions. In refusal-assertion training, clients can maintain recordings of daily situations in which they wanted to behave more assertively, had the opportunity for self-assertion, or actually did handle an interaction assertively. A portion of each skills-training session can be spent reviewing such self-monitoring data brought in by the client. In commendatory training, similar information can be kept on situations involving the positive behavior ofothers. Situations that the individual did not handle well can be incorporated in role-play practice during the session. The therapist should strongly reinforce instances when the client attempted to use the assertion skill. Use ofhomework assignments. \"Homework\" assignments can be incorporated in treatment, especially later in training, when the client has learned more effective self-assertion skills than he initially had. Particularly if selfmonitoring data do not reveal frequent in-vivo use of assertion skills, clients should be instructed to seek out situations where they can behave assertively. This could involve instruction to compliment other people\\'s positive behavior at work or in social situations, to offer one\\'s own opinion to someone else during any discussion or meeting, and so on. Although it is often not feasible to \"assign\" clients who have received refusal-assertion training to situations where others will infringe upon their rights, it is possible to ask clients to remain in orenter into situations that they might have previously avoided and to then use their assertive skills. Assertion homework of this kind should always 194 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions include the task of recording, in self-monitoring fashion, the details of such situations and discussing them with the therapist in the next session. Use of cognitive modification. Cognitive modification techniques should be included in the intervention. Cognitive restructuring is an important element in any form of skills-training; it seems especially salient for assertive-training because clients may have fears that others will not like their new assertiveness. As long as cognitive inhibitions and anxieties are strong, the likelihood that a client will actually use assertive behavior is reduced. Several studies have directly compared social-skills training and cognitive restructuring interventions. Linehan, Goldfried, and Goldfried (1979) found that treatment combining behavioral skills-training with a cognitive modification approach was generally more effective than either approach used alone. The cognitive restructuring used by these investigators involved teaching clients to identify their self-defeating or anxiety-maintaining thoughts, relabel or re-evaluate situations in a less threatening manner, generate positive self-statements about assertion, and so on. These techniques and others reviewed in Chapter 4 should be used in treatment sessions. Additionally, clients can be instructed to practice cognitive change techniques in the natural environment, just as they are instructed to practice their newly acquired skill behaviors in the in-vivo situations. Assertion-Training in Groups A number ofinvestigators have conductedgroupassertion-training projects and we will consider several of the more comprehensive interventions in detail. Galassi, Galassi, and Litz (1974) treated unassertive male and female college students using a group-administered assertion-training procedure. In addition, they compared clients who received the group assertiveness-training with control groups consisting of students who received no treatment. Assertivetraining groups were composed of 8 students (4 males and 4 females) and sessions were held twice weekly over 4 weeks; each session lasted about 90 minutes. Before the initiation of training, each client completed the College SelfExpression Scale (Galassi et al., 1974) and role-played a variety of scenes that required refusal and commendatory assertiveness. A confederate partner played the other person in the scene; role-play scenes with multiple partnerprompts, requiring responses by the client to each prompt, were used. Each client\\'s assessment role-plays were rated for the presence ofbehavioral components comprising effective refusal and commendatory assertion. Clients were also asked to evaluate on a 0 to 100 scale how much discomfort they felt during these role-plays. Assertiveness-Training 195 Each assertion-training session throughout the intervention was broken down into three 30-minute segments. During the ftrst segment, group members discussed the rationale for self-assertion, discriminating assertion from unassertive or aggressive behavior, and they discussed in-vivo situations in which they had behaved assertively. The therapist assigned \"homework\" to each group member (assignments to practice their skills outside the training setting); these results were also discussed at the beginning of each session. In the next session segment, clients viewed and discussed modeling videotapes showing appropriately assertive interactions. Finally, the group broke down into dyads, with one member of each dyad playing the partner in role-plays requiring assertiveness and the other member practicing assertive responses. Feedback during this practice was provided by the client playing the partner in the dyad, as well as by the therapist, who observed each dyad\\'s rehearsals. Some client pairs were videotaped while role-playing, and they then viewed the videotape replay of their practice interaction. Feedback comments were directed toward speciftc components of assertion, as well as the client\\'s anxiety and ease of interaction. The authors note that relatively easy scenes were used for practice in early training sessions, with progressively more difficult role-play scenes used later in the intervention. After the intervention\\'s conclusion, additional role-plays were presented and formally rated for the presence of targeted assertion-components. The CSES and perceived anxiety measures were also re-administered. Galassi et al. (1974) found that students in the assertive-training groups improved on almost all measures compared to their pretraining levels; clients in assertion-training also improved relative to those persons who were in the control group conditions. This project illustrates how assertion-training procedures can be incorporated within a group-treatment format. The use ofclient dyads for skill practice in each session permitted all individuals to intensively rehearse the behaviors they had just discussed in the group and seen in the videotape models. Also, the use of session time to review each client\\'s use of assertive skills in the natural environment was a very desirable aspect of training. Finally, feedback on practice came from a variety of sources, including the client\\'s practice partner, the therapist, and via self-observation on videotape. The study\\'s participants were unassertive college students; however, a similar-format intervention could prove useful for many other client groups. Ollendick and Hersen (1979) conducted assertiveness-training with a group ofmalejuveniledelinquentswhosemeanage was 14years, withinaresidential training center. The assertive-training group had 9 members and was compared to a more traditional discussion-only therapy group and to clients who received no treatment. All clients were assessed before the intervention phase using self-report inventories and a set of role-play scenes that called for both refusal 196 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions and commendatory skills. The situations depicted in the assessment role-plays were interactions that could occur within the residential training-school environment, and the assessment role-plays were different than those used in training. Client performance in refusal scenes was rated for components of effective refusal-assertiveness; commendatory scene role-plays were evaluated for the presence of commendatory skill behaviors. The assertive-training group, led by two male co-therapists, met weekly for ten 7S-minute sessions. In each group, training focused on teaching all participants to exhibitskillcomponents duringrole-plays oftroublesome interactions. Instructions in skill use were provided by the therapists, with group discussion ofalternativewaystohandleinteractionsthatrequireassertiveness. Role-plays used in the training groups were of situations that the adolescents actually reported as troublesome; the therapists specifically asked that members bring to the group information on interpersonal problems they were having with other clients and staff. These problem situations were then made into role-plays for behavior rehearsal. Live-modeling in the sessions was provided when the therapists role-played appropriately assertive behaviors, and the adolescents themselves then role-played each scene with one another. Feedback and reinforcement were provided by the therapists and by the clients, who observed one another\\'s in-group behavior-rehearsal. Finally, clients were given instructions to practice appropriate refusal and commendatory skills in the school during the upcoming week. Part ofeach group-training session was devoted to the review, discussion, and reinforcement of each client\\'s reports of skill-usage in the natural (school) environment. During the IO-week period when the clients were receiving assertiontraining, adolescents in the discussion group were meeting weekly for more traditional, discussion-based therapy. Also led by co-therapists, this discussion-only group focused on interpersonal problem situations and alternative ways to handle them. However, behavioral skills-training techniques were not used. Two weeks after the intervention phase, adolescents in the skills-training, discussion, and no-treatment control groups repeated the set of role-plays and inventories that had been administered before the intervention. Ratings of the pretreatment and posttreatment measures indicated that adolescents in the assertive-training group were superior to the discussion-group and controlgroup clients in exhibiting many components ofaffective assertion during their role-plays. Further, self-report measures indicated that decreased anxiety and improved self-evaluation were associated with skills-training. A general improvement in client day-to-day social conduct within the facility, shown by improved performance in a token-economy/behavioral-contracting program, was demonstrated only by the adolescents in the assertive-training group: The Ollendick and Hersen (1979) project illustrates several useful points for conducting group assertiveness training. One of the most practical is the Assertiveness-Training 197 therapists\\' requirement that clients themselves bring information to the group each week on real interpersonal problems they experienced, and the construction of behavior-rehearsal role-play scenes in training sessions to approximate those situations. This procedure ensures that clients receive training on better handling interactions known to be troublesome to them. Combined with \"homework\"\\'assignments and group time devoted to reinforcing the clients\\' reports of skill-usage in the natural environment, this may have been responsible for improvement in the adolescents\\' day-to-day performance on the token! behavioral-contracting system at the facility. Given that it is possible to conduct assertive-training with either one individual or with a group ofclients, is one mode oftraining perferable to another? A study by Linehan, Walker, Bronheim, Haynes, and Yevzeroff(1979) compared individual and group-training interventions in a sample of unassertive women. The training group consisted of 8 clients and was led by two cotherapists. The same therapists each saw four additional clients in individual assertive-training sessions. Eight I II2-hour group sessions or eight I-hour individual sessions constituted the respective interventions. In both individual and group training, clients were taught to exhibit components of refusal assertion during extended role-play interactions. Treatment consisted of therapist instruction, modeling, behavior rehearsal, feedback, cognitive modification, and in-vivo practice assignments between sessions. For individual training, the therapist served as the role-play practice partner, while in group training, clients role-played their practice scenes with other clients for behavior rehearsal. After the interventions, clients who had received individual training were compared with those who had been in the assertive-training group on both assertive role-play scenes and the Rathus Assertiveness Schedule (Rathus, 1973). There were no significant differences between the group-treated or individually treated clients on any measure. Although more detailed and larger scale data are needed, it appears that group and individual assertive-training both can yield positive clinical results. Chapter 9 Job-Interview Skills-Training Very few brief social interactions can influence a person\\'s future more profoundly than the job interview. Most employment interviews are brief; one survey of experienced campus personnel interviewers indicates that the great majority make their evaluation of prospective graduating college-student job candiates in less than 30 minutes (Drake, Kaplan, & Stone, 1972). For lower educational level jobs, the interview may be considerably shorter. However, in spite of the brevity of the social interaction between an interviewer and an employment applicant, it has been demonstrated that employers attribute a great deal of importance to the behavior of an applicant in this situation. The social impression created by the applicant is often more important than such \"objective\" work background characteristics as school grades or work experience (Drake et al., 1972; Lumsden & Sharf, 1974; Tschirgi, 1973). This, of course, is fortunate, since while most job-seekers cannot change their past experience or grades, they can learn the social competencies needed to handle interviews effectively. Job interviews are a source of anxiety for a number of reasons, some of which were discussed earlier. First, the interview is a social interaction for which few people have an extensive learning history. Because most people do not engage in employment interviews frequently, they may have little knowledge of how to behave that is based on their own past personal experience in these situations. Since interviews are private interactions, people also rarely have the opportunityto observe how skilled models handletheirjobinterviews. Second, candidates seeking employment do not usually receive specific feedback on their performance following the interview interaction. While an individualdoesgetaveryglobalform offeedback (\"hired\"versus\"nothired\"), it is not \"tied\" to specific aspects of the person\\'s behavior. Consequently, the applicant who performs badly in an interview probably will not learn what aspects of his or her behavior were deficient and will no be in a position to change them. The vocationally competent client reported by Hollandsworth et 198 Job-Interview Skills~Training 199 al. (1978), who went on 60 different unsuccessful job interviews before seeking treatment, provides an example, albeit extreme, of the manner in which inadequate performance-feedback in natural-setting interviews can contribute to repeated social-skill failure. Finally, because employment interviews are important but short interactions, in which the individual knows his or her social behavior is closely scrutinized by someone else, many persons experience anticipatory social-evaluative anxiety in that situation. To the degree that excessive anxiety is present, the candidate\\'s objective skill-performance will be impaired. Although we might speak of the job interview as a fairly specific, clear-cut kind of social interaction, it is apparent that there are many different types of interviews; relatively different social behaviors may be required in each. For example, the exact questions that an applicant will be asked depend upon the habits, interests, andstyle oftheinterviewer;thesophisticationandlevel ofjob for which the candidate is applying; whether the applicant is attempting to get a \"fIrst\" job or is in the midst of a career change; and statements made by the candidate earlier in the interview, which can influence the kinds of questions that will be asked by the interviewer later in the interaction. Additionally, effective skill requires that the candidate do more than simply answer the interviewer\\'s questions; the ability to ask relevant questions, initiate topics of conversation, comment spontaneously on past experiences, and so on are also requisiteaspects ofskill. However,whilethereisconsiderablevariabilityinthe exact method in which a given interview is conducted, most interviewers appear to look for similar characteristics in an applicant: evidence ofambition, motivation, social competence and ease, leadership or independence qualities, and evidence ofgood performance in previous work-related areas (cf. Cohen & Etheridge, 1975; Drake et al., 1972; Lumsden & Sharf, 1974). The purpose of job-interview skills-training is to assist clients in learning those social behaviors that will create a positive interviewer-impression along these dimensions. Regardless ofthe quality of the individual\\'s background, preparedness, or employment potential, unless the individual also develops the social skills to convey vocational or social competence in the interview setting, it is unlikely that the person will actually be hired. Client Populations for lob-Interview Training Job-interview training interventions have focused on several distinct client populations, which include students who are completing their education or training and are about to enter employment, chronically unemployed persons, and clients who have had some form of past social or emotional incapacitation but are now entering or re-entering the employment market. The work of Hollandsworth and his associates has focused primarily on interview training 200 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions for job-seeking students, with clients receiving individual treatment (Hollandsworth et al., 1978) and group-administered interventions (Hollandsworth et al., 1977; Hollandsworth & Sandifer, 1979). Although these efforts have been with graduating college and vocational-technical students, a related population for whom interview-skills training might be conducted is high school students who will be entering the labor market upon graduation. Each of these groups is likely to include many persons with little experience and skill in the jobinterview social interaction. Chronically unemployed, disadvantaged clients have also been the recipients ofjob-interview training in several interventions (Barbee & Keil, 1973; Keil & Barbee, 1973). As these investigators note, culturally disadvantaged individuals may perform poorly in employment interview due to passive selfpresentation, lack of verbal facility, poor self-confidence, and a history of sufficient past unemployment that it becomes difficult to convey their current vocational competence. Without specific training in job-interview skills, many chronically unemployed persons are unlikely to leave favorable impressions on the employment interviewers with whom they interact. Job-interview skills-training procedures have also been successfully used with more specialized, clinical populations of clients discharged from residential facilites. These include predelinquent adolescents who would later be seeking jobs (Braukmann, Fixsen, Phillips, Wolf, & Maloney, 1974); former drug abusers (Stevens & Tomatzky, 1976); and mildly retarded individuals who were considered to have employment potential but lacked the social skills needed to present themselves favorably in interviews (Kelly, Wildman, & Berler, 1980). In a series of studies, we have conducted job-interview training with formerly hospitalized psychiatric patients, many of whom completed vocational rehabilitation but still had been unable to obtain standard (nonsheltered) employment in the community (Furman et al., 1979; Kelly, Laughlin, Claiborne, & Patterson, 1979; Kelly, Vrey, & Patterson, in press). For each of these client populations, job interviews may be difficult, not only because the clients often exhibit relatively pervasive social-skill impairment, but also because the individual may be asked to account for periods in the past when he or she was not working and the client does not want to reveal detailed information about the extended hospitalization. In summary, job-interview training might be considered for inexperienced job-seekers, including students who will be seeking work. It can also usefully be included in social-rehabilitation-type programs in which clients will be attempting to gain employment. Finally, job-interview training is appropriate for individual clients of any kind who appear potentially employable but seem unable to portray themselves favorably within the interview situation, which might be inferred from a history of multiple unsuccessful interviews for positions that the client was qualified to obtain, or excessive client anxiety associated with the prospect of interviewing. Job-Interview Skills-Training 201 Job-Interview Skills-Assessment Because the format for conducting a behavioral assessment of client jobinterview skills differs somewhat from the other interaction sample-procedures we have considered to this point, we will first review it. Then components of effective interview-skill will be discussed. The lob-Interview Role-Play In the assertion-training role-plays that were considered in the last chapter, a role-play scene consisted of a narrated situation description followed by one or more prompt-comments delivered by the interaction partner, to which the client responds. And a number of different role-play scenes are presented, both for pretraining assessment and for behavior-rehearsal during training sessions. In the case of job-interview role-plays, client performance in only one situation-the simulated interview-is being assessed or practiced. However, the interaction partner delivers an entire series ofquestions or comments to the client over the course of this single role-play interaction. In most reports of job-interview training interventions, the comments ofthe partnerwho plays the interviewer follows a \"script,\" so that a set of predetermined questions or comments are always made. For example, in an assessment interview, the client might be seated across a desk form the \"interviewer\" and comments such as the following could be directed to the client: I don\\'t like to read application forms, Mr.lMs. . Can you tell me something about yourself? What sort of experience do you have for this position? Tell me about school and your educational background. What qualities do you think are your best? Tell me about your last job and why you aren\\'t there now. What are your hobbies? Why should I hire you instead of someone else? What do you hope to be doing in five years? Do you have any questions for me? Inorderforarole-play ofthiskind tobeausefulassessmentdeviceand, later, a useful practice device, the questions directed to the client should approximate the questions that the client will actually encounter on a genuine interview. Somewhat different interview role-play scripts might be developed for individual clients, since the interview encountered by a college engineering graduate will probably consist of different questions and content than an interview encountered by, say, a high-school student seeking an entry-level labor job. A therapist might even wish to informally sUrvey some local personnel interview202 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions ers to detennine what sorts of questions they routinely ask applicants whose backgrounds or position-goals are similar to those of the therapist\\'s own client. A role-play interview is also apt to be most salient when both the client and the partner play their parts with a specific position in mind. If a client is really seeking work as a bank teller, for example, the interviewer might behave as a bank\\'s personnel officer would, and both the client and partner would make comments in the role-play accordingly. When the interviewer directs a comment to the client and the client has role-played a response to it, the interviewer might then pause for a brief interval of time (perhaps five seconds) before proceeding to the next question in the script. This will allow the client time to fully elaborate any response and, in later role-plays, will permit the client time to incorporate new skill-behaviors in responses without being \"clipped\" as a new question is asked by the interviewer. To avoid an unnaturally stilted role-play, the interviewer might make additional comments to the client that are not on the script; these include ad-libbed answers to questions asked by the client, occasionally summarizing the client\\'s responses, and so on. Behavioral Definitions of Components oflob-Interview Skills In assertion-training role-plays, the therapist observing the client evaluates each separate response following a partner comment to determine whether all behavioral components are included in that response. In contrast, the entire role-played job interview is typically the unit that is evaluated by the therapist, and the frequency or presence of skill-behaviors occurring throughout the interview is rated. Behaviors that have been shown to contribute to interview effectiveness include: eye contact; appropriate affect; speech loudness, clarity, and fluency; positive self-statements about past experience; positive selfstatements about personal hobbies, interests, and pursuits; questions directed to the interviewer; and statements conveying job interest and enthusiasm. We will examine these in detail Eye contact, appropriate affect, and speech loudness, clarity, and fluency are defined in the same manner as they were for skills that we considered in the preceding chapters. Eye contact represents the percentage of active speaking and listening time throughout the interaction during which the client maintains visual contact with the role-play interviewer; it can range fonn 0% to 100% of the time. Appropriate affect refers to the client\\'s appropriateness of emotional tone during the role-play and is often rated on a scale of I =extremely poor to 7=extremely good. Extremely poor affect might be characterized by an absence of lively voice intonation, an absence of smiles, a Job-Interview Skills-Training 203 bored or disinterested demeanor, little emotional responsiveness to the interviewer, and so on. Appropriate affect includes lively modulation or tone of voice, facial expression conveying interest in and responsivity to the interviewer, smiling at appropriate times, etc. The third nonverbal component is speech loudness, clarity, and fluency. It, too, can be most easily rated by the therapist usinga I-to-7scale.Thedeficientend oftherange ischaracterizedbyinaudible speech, frequent verbal disruptions such as \"ab,\" \"umm,\" \"well,\" and the lack of speech clarity. Positive self-statements about past experience. training, or education are any verbalizations made by the client that convey desirable information to the interviewer concerning job-relevant experiences in the past. These might be facts about what the client did in previous jobs, responsibilties that one had, statements conveying that the client enjoyed or performed well in past jobs, or special vocational competencies acquired by the person. For clients who have had little actual job experience, this component category could also include information statements about educational background, vocational training, volunteer work, or related skills. Statements about experience should be positive in tone, and should consist of information that is both relevant to employment and likely to be perceived favorably by an interviewer. Some examples of positive statements about experience include: \"I operated a die press machine\"; \"I worked at Acme Manufacturing Company for 6 years\"; \"My sales in 1979 were the largest in our department\"; \"I can type 50 words per minute\"; \"My favorite subject in high school was home economics\"; and \"I missed only 2 days of work in three years.\" In some cases, clients may link several statements about experience together in one sentence, such as \"In college, I majored in chemistry and also worked part-time to pay for my tuition.\" Here, the individual is actually conveying two different pieces of information (\"majored in chemistry\" and \"worked part-time\"), and each might be rated as an instance of the self-statement component. The therapist observing a role-play interview can tally the total number of positive statements about experience made by a client over the course of the entire interview. The rationale for assessing and training this behavior is that many skills-deficient clients fail to convey sufficient positive, specific information about their background and experience during job interviews. Positive self-statements about personal hobbies, interests. and pursuits can serve to help an interviewer learn more about the candidate as a person, an area of interest to many personnel interviewers (see Drake et al., 1972; Lumsden & Sharf, 1974). Examples of this verbal component include client statements such as: \"I play golf in my free time on weekends\"; \"I jog 4 miles a day\"; \"My husband and I like to water ski\"; and \"I played basketball all 204 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions through high school.\" Because interviewers value candidate characteristics indicative of motivation, ambition, activity, and a \"well-rounded\" personality, it is preferable for clients to talk about those activities or interests that reflect such characteristics. Just as positive statements about experience are rated by tallying each one that occurs throughout the role-play interview, positive comments about personal pursuits can also be rated with a frequency-count system. Questions directed to the interviewer occur when the client seeks information by asking a question relevant to the prospective position. Asking questions in a job interview serves at least two purposes: First, it demonstrates to the interviewer that the client is interested in the job, and signals inquisitiveness and attentiveness on the part of the client. Second, the client is able to obtain information that will be important in making a decision about whether the position is one in which he or she is actually interested. Examples of appropriate questions include: \"Can you tell me about the responsibilities of this position?\"; \"To whom will 1be accountable?\"; \"What opportunities will there be for advancement?\"; \"Are uniforms furnished by the company?\"; and \"When do you expect to reach a hiring decision?\" Statements conveyingjob interest and enthusiasm are comments that explicitly communicate to the interviewer that the client is interested in the position or that the client will do a good job if hired. Some examples of this component are: \"This sounds like a very interesting job\"; \"From what you have said, 1think 1 would feel very good about working at your company\"; \"I learn quickly and will workhard\"; and\"Youwillbepleasedifyoudecidetohireme.\" In contrast to the positive statements about previous experience, these verbal statements describe the client\\'s current feelings or future performance in positive terms. The purpose of these behaviors is to convey confidence and interest about the work. They, too, can be rated on a frequency-count basis as they occur throughout the entire role-play interview. Rating Client Role-Play Interviews for the Presence of Skill-Component Behaviors As the therapist observes a client\\'s role-play job-interview, and as the dient responds to the questions asked by the interviewer partner, the therapist tallies the occurrence of any verbal component-behaviors on the rating-form. A sample form for rating a client\\'s job-interview skill is presented in Figure 9.1.Some verbal components are likely to \"cluster\" at certain points in the interaction. For example, when the interviewer asks a question about past work history, the client may respond with several positive self-statements FIGURE 9.1.

Other Components Being Rated (or any undesirable, inappropriate behaviors being examined) Definition/Description of Behavior, Frequency Count or Rating, 205 206 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions about experience. However, this and other components can be appropriately exhibited at different interview times as well, and should be tallied whenever they occur. The therapist can attend to the nonverbal behaviors of eye contact, affect, and speech quality during the role-play and, upon the interaction\\'s conclusion, assign ratings to eachofthesecomponents. Finally, inanassessmentrole-play, other behaviors exhibited by the client might also be evaluated. In several studies, formerly hospitalized psychiatric patients were found to spontaneously self-disclose inappropriate information to the role-play interviewer, making references to past \"nerve trouble,\" psychiatric hospitalization, and so on (Kelly, Laughlin, Claiborne, & Patterson, 1979). Instances of these inappropriate behaviors were rated during pretreatment assessment role-plays and again later in treatment to determine if they ceased to occur following training in appropriate verbal skills. When one or more assessment role-plays have been conducted and systematically rated, the therapist can analyze the rating-form data to pinpoint inadequacies in the client\\'s job-interview performance-those components will require later treatment attention. Certainly, if the behaviors discussed in this section are absent or occur at very low rates, they can be identified as deficient. However, there has been virtuallyno empirical data on the ideal frequency of occurrence for any component ofjob-interview competence. This is a potentially problematic issue, since we wish to have clients fully elaborate their relevant experience, but not talk excessively; a client who never expresses interest or enthusiasm in a position is likely to be perceived unfavorably, but so is the client who overstates enthusiasm to the point of appearing arrogant and pushy. Thus, a therapist may be forced to rely somewhat on his or her own subjective determinationofwhether a client\\'s performance in assessment role-plays is ata deficient level on a given component. Representative Research on Job-Interview Training Let us examine several studies that illustrate how job-interview training has been used in applied settings, first considering interview training with individually treated clients and then group-training interventions. Interview Training with Individual Clients Keil and Barbee (1973) conducted skills-training with disadvantaged clients enrolled in a federal government vocational-technical skills program. All clients were either minority-group members or had limited education prior to their vocational program participation; clients\\' mean age was 27. Each of the Job-Interview Skills-Training 207 clients had successfully completed vocational training and would be graduating from the program within 60 days. However, while the clients were \"jobready,\" the investigators noted that many clients would be likely to experience difficulties in actually attaining employment due to their inadequately developed job-interview skills repertoire. For this reason, social-skills training was conducted. The intervention itself was brief and consisted ofonly a single training session. Prior to treatment, each client participated in a videotaped assessment interview. The simulated interviews were conducted by a genuine personnel interviewer, who participated in the project. Although the interactions were somewhat structured, they were not based on a role-play interview script. Instead, the experienced interviewer asked whatever questions he feIt appropriate during the pretest interview. When role-plays were repeated at the conclusion of the intervention, the interviewer was given a list of the questions and content areas that he had covered in pretraining interactions with each client, so that a given individual would be assessed with a comparable interview both pretreatment and posttreatment. During training sessions, each client was paired with a counselor. First, the client and counselor together viewed the videotape of the client\\'s assessment role-play interview, and developed a list of those specific behaviors that the client exhibited well and those where improvement was needed. Next, the counselor (playing an interviewer) and client (playing an applicant) rehearsed interview questions and responses in areas in which deficits had been noted in the film. The trainer verbally reinforced improvement in the client\\'s responses, provided feedback, and made specific suggestions on ways to exhibit the target behaviors more effectively. Occasionally in the session, the client played the interviewer and the counselor played the applicant, so that the counselor could live-model examples of appropriate skill-components. Finally, the counselor and clientdiscussed otheraspects ofinterview skill and the importance ofusing new skill-behaviors during genuine interviews. Following treatment sessions, each client had a second complete simulated interview with the same person who had conducted the pretreatment interview. A control group, consisting of clients who had received no training, also underwent the same simulated interviews. Videotapes ofall clients\\' pretraining andposttraining interviewswere shownto apanel ofjudges, all ofwhomwere professional personnel managers. The judges rated each interview on 19 different aspects of client skill and summed up their own reaction to the client (e.g., \"ability to explain and sell present job skills\"; \"ability to follow directions\"; \"would you hire this applicant if a suitable position existed in your company?\") using 7-point rating scales. On a number of these judges\\' ratings, Keil and Barbee (1973) found improvement to be associated with having received the skills-training intervention. However, on some indices, including 208 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions the crucial question, \"Would you hire this applicant?\" no improvement was found. This may well have been due to the brevity of the single-session treatment and the clients\\' own skill-deficits, which probably required a more intensive intervention. Funnan et al. (1979) reported on a more lengthy intervention. In this project, the clients were three formerly hospitalized but potentially employable psychiatric patients. Sessions were conducted at a mental health center aftercare program, where each client was receiving treatment. Before training, each client was assessed with role-play job interviews on three different occasions. The assessment interviews followed a structured-script format, with a staffperson playing the interviewer and directing a set of 8 standard questions to the client in the manner described earlier in this chapter. Assessment role-plays were videotaped and component deficits were identified for each client. These includedstatementsaboutpastexperience, verbalstatements ofjobinterestand enthusiasm, gesturing, and job-relevant questions directed to the interviewer. Component ratings were made by the therapists using a form similar to that included in this chapter. Also before treatment, each client engaged in one simulated interview with an experienced personnel interviewer. These interactions were not structured in any way and the interviewer was asked to conduct the session just as he ordinarily would. Clients received skills-training that consisted of between 8 and 19 sessions; each lasted approximately 30 minutes. The number of sessions that a particular client received was determined by the extent of that client\\'s initial deficiency (i.e., the number of skill-components on which deficits were observed during pretreatment assessment role-plays) and how quickly the client was able to exhibit new behaviors during session practice. Training sessions were always devoted to a single component of effective interview skill; when the client had mastered that component, a new behavior was introduced for training in the next session, until all of a client\\'s previously deficient behaviors had been successively targeted in the intervention. Training sessions in the Funnan et al. (1979) project consisted ofinstruction; coaching; examples, the rationale for the component targeted in that day\\'s session; informal practice responses to typical interview questions, with the therapist playing the interviewer and the client incorporating the behavior in his or her responses; a full role-play practice interview, identical to that used in the pretreatment assessment phase, with one of the therapists serving as the role-play partner; and observation ofa videotape of the just-completed practice role-play, with the therapist and client together critiquing the client\\'s performance in the interview. The therapists always rated the session-practice roleplays to objectively determine how frequently the client actually exhibited the skill-components that were receiving attention. At the conclusion of the entire intervention, when the client had mastered all Job-Interview Skills-Training 209 component behaviors and exhibited them consistently during the in-session practice role-plays, an unstructured role-play interview with a genuine personnel manager was repeated. This was to determine whether the clients could generalize use of their new skills to a novel interviewer who asked interview questions different than those comprising the structured practice role-plays. In all cases, client interview performance in the posttraining generalization interviews was much more effective than performance before treatment. Not only did clients exhibit the component-behaviors more frequently, but videotapes of the interviews were evaluated more favorably by naive personnel managers who observed the tapes on global, subjective criteria of social effectiveness. Two of the three clients began working shortly after the intervention, whereas all had been unemployed for at least two years previously. In contrast to Keil and Barbee\\'s (1973) project, the Furman et al. (1979) study was a more intensive intervention, consisting of multiple treatment sessions and directing attention to various verbal and nonverbal skillcomponents over the course of training. Although each study incorporated similar procedures into training sessions (including coaching, behavior rehearsal with the therapist, feedback, and so on), the fact that Furman et al. (1979) concentrated attention on only a single component within any given session and devoted several sessions to a component may have been responsible for the apparently greater generalization and durability of treatment effects. In Chapter 2, the job-interview training procedure used by Hollandsworth et al. (1978) to treat an anxious and socially deficient graduating college student was described. The format ofeach training session was generally similar to the projects we have just reviewed. The therapist provided instructions and examples of the component receiving attention that day, the rationale for the behaviorwas discussed, avideotapemodeling-film ofa skilledinterviewee was shown, and a role-play practice job-interview was conducted. Selfobservation-based feedback was provided when a videotape of this practice interview was replayed at the end of the training session. However, the Hollandsworth et al. (1978) project included an additional element in its treatment sessions. Pretraining assessment role-plays suggested that the client had difficulty formulating direct, focused, and informative responses to the role-play interviewer\\'s questions. Instead, his responses appeared to verbally ramble and were quite disorganized. In order to treat this aspect of the client\\'s interview-skill deficiency, the investigators incorporated a \"Pause-Tbink-Speak\" approach to training. Whenever the interviewer would ask a question in role-play practice during sessions, the client was advised to break eye contact with the interviewer, think momentarily about key elements to include in his response, and only then respond to the question directly and clearly. Inessence, the \"Pause-Think-Speak\" sequence reduced the likelihood that the client would deliver rapid but disorganized rambling responses, by allowing him to 210 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions pause for a few seconds to cognitively plan more coherent, succinct statements. This aspect oftraining proved successful, because when it was incorporated in treatment sessions, ratings of the client\\'s role-play interviews revealed improvement in the \"focused\" quality of his responses. The Hollandsworth et al. (1978) project is one of relatively few job-interview training studies that directly and explicity trained style of self-presentation, in addition to behavioral components of interview-effectiveness. Group Job-Interview Training Group training in job-interview skills has been reported in projects with formerly hospitalized psychiatric patients (Kelly, Laughlin, Claiborne, & Patterson, 1979); mental health center clients (Kelly, Urey, & Patterson, in press), and mentally retarded adolescents (Kelly, Wildman, & Berler, 1980). Each of these studies utilized relatively similar procedures; we will focus here only on the skills-training group-intervention with retarded adolescents, since its procedures are representative of the others. Clients in this project were four youths, age 15 to 17, who would soon be leaving a short-term residential program for the mentally retarded. Each client was mildly retarded; all seemed potentially employable for standard (nonsheltered) work positions in the community. Before the group intervention began, each client\\'s pretraining skills were assessed with individual role-play job interviews. College student practicum students were used as role-play interviewers and followed a standard interview script, as outlined earlier in this chapter. Ten questions were always included in the role-play interaction, although the interviewers occasionally made other comments and answered client job-related questions in an ad-lib manner during the role-plays. Because the investigators sought to establish a clear baseline of client skill before training began, four separate assessment role-plays were conducted. Interviews were always audiotape-recorded and rated to determine the frequency of verbal components such as positive statements about experience, positive statements about hobbies or interests, job-related questions directed to the role-play interviewer, and statements conveying interesUenthusiasm in working. All occurred at very low levels during the assessment role-plays. A total of 16 group sessions were conducted, with several sessions devoted to each component. Co-therapists led each group. Sessions began with instructions, examples, and group discussion concerning the particular component that would receive training that day. A modeling job-interview videotape was shown to the group, with the therapists pointing out examples of the targeted component whenever the adolescent model in the film exhibited it. Behavior rehearsal within the group was then conducted. On some occasions, one of the therapists would ask several interview questions to a group member, and the client would practice incorporating the component in his responses. Other Job-Interview Skills-Training 211 clients would observe their peer and afterward offer feedback, suggestions, and praise. At other times, two clients would be paired together for in-group rehearsal, with one playing an interviewer and the other an interviewee. Rehearsal techniques were varied in order to add variety to the group session. However, in every session, each client had an opportunity to rehearse responses to interview questions and to receive feedback and comments from both the other clients and the therapists. At the conclusion of the group session, each adolescent was escorted to a separate office for a complete role-played interview, with the college practicum student acting as interviewer and following the script that had been used in assessment role-plays. These interviews were also audiotaped and rated to determine whether the clients exhibited skill-components in them. Ifincreased used of a component coincided with the time when that behavior received attention in the training group, multiplebaseline control could be established. Kelly, Wildman, and Beder (1980) found that the adolescents did exhibit increased interview skill-components during their role-play interviews, and improvement was evident only when the group worked on a given component. To assess generalization of treatment, the investigators enlisted the assistance of a local fast-food restaurant, which hired many teenage employees. Before the intervention, and again after training was completed, each client was interviewed by the store\\'s manager at the restaurant itself. These in-vivo interviews were unstructured and the manager was asked to conduct the interview as he ordinarily would. When tape recordings ofthe in-vivo pretraining and posttraining generalization were evaluated, the investigators found that clients increased theirrates ofpositive statements about experience and hobbies or interests. In addition, posttraining taped interviews were evaluated more favorably than pretraining interviews on a number of global measures of skill effectiveness by other personnel interviewers who were asked to listen to them. This project demonstrates that group training, using procedures similar to those of individual training, can enhance clients\\' job-interview skills repertoires. The major differences between group-administered and individually administered treatment in the studies we have reviewed so far include for group training: (1) discussion in the sesson among clients of the rationale or importanceofvarious skill-behaviors; (2) clientsengaging in behavioral practice with other clients, instead of practice taking place exclusively with the therapist or a therapist confederate; (3) client in-group practice serving as a vicarious learning experience for other clients watching it; and (4) clients, along with the therapist, providing feedback and comments to one another following their in-session rehearsal. While the 16-session intervention in the Kelly, Wildman, and Beder (1980) project was relatively long, it is important to note that the clients were mildly retarded and may have required more repetition to acquire new skills than would other types of clients. A study by Speas (1979) sought to delineate some aspects of treatment that 212 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions are responsible for client skill-improvement in group job-interview training. From a population of soon-to-be released prisoners, Speas randomly assigned clients to training groups that consisted of modeling-exposure only, roleplaying only, modeling-exposure plus role-playing, or modeling-exposure plus role-playing and videotape feedback. Printed self-help materials on jobinterviewing were given to all clients, regardless of training condition. Other clients were placed in a no-treatment control group. Clients who received training met for six I Y2-hour sessions, except for the modeling-only group, which received somewhat less session time; sessions were always led by two co-therapists. Before, and again after, the intervention, each client participated in a simulated individual job-interview. The pretraining and posttraining interviews were rated on a variety of measures related to social skill, and the results were analyzed to compare the performance of clients who had received each type of training. Speas (1979) found that, in general, the group that had received the full combination of treatment procedures (modeling, role-playing, plus feedback) was superior in interview performance to most other groups at the end of treatment and, even more impressively, at follow-up several weeks after training was completed. Interestingly, the group who spent session-time observing skilled videotape models, but not actually practicing job-interview skills, did not perform better in the posttraining simulated interviews than clients who had received no training at all. It appears that although learningtheory-based techniques such as modeling and role-playing were relatively ineffective when used alone, the combination of these procedures in sessions was maximally effective in building, and then maintaining, job-interview skills. Other Issues in Applied Job-Interview Training Before concluding our discussion of social-skills training for the jOb-interview interaction, there are several other treatment-related issues that merit attention. These are: (1) the importance ofclients\\' generalizing their skills-improvement to in-vivo, genuine interviews and (2) stylistic aspects of self-presentation in employment interviews. Enhancing the Generalization oflob-Interview Skills-Training Just as for the other forms ofsocial skill considered to this point, it is crucial that clients exhibit new job-interview skill behavior not only in practice role-plays, but also in genuine employment interviews they will actually encounter. What steps can be taken to promote this generalization? As we noted earlier, the interview questions asked of clients during their assessment and practice role-plays should approximate the kinds of questions Job-Interview Skills-Training 213 they will actually encounter on real job interviews. Thus, the interview roleplay script might be tailored not only to the level ofemployment that the client seeks, but also the exact position sought by the individual. However, no matter how carefully the therapist constructs practice interview questions, one cannot entirely predict the exact questions and interviewer style that a client will encounter on a given real job-interview. Thus, the client will need to generalize skill-usage to situations different than those ofthe training role-play interview. Ifa client learns only to respond to the exact interviewer questions that he or she practices during simulated interviews, the individual may fail to perform well when slightly different questions are asked, or may fail to spontaneously offer important, job-relevant information if the real-life interviewer fails to ask a question that had elicited that information in practice role-plays. These potential problems may be dealt with in several ways. First, although a standard role-play script can be used for practice job-interviews during training sessions, at some point the client should encounter variations of the standard questions. This might occur near the end of the intervention, when the basic role-play has already been well-mastered. In some of these more \"difficult\" role-plays, the interviewer might intentionally fail to ask about applicant experience, training, education, or fail to inquire whether the applicant has any questions; the client will then need to more spontaneously offer appropriate comments on these topics during the practice interview. Also, interviewer characteristics could be varied. Ifpractice role-plays have ordinarily been with a male partner, a female partner can be used; the role-play interviewer might also adopt different styles (warm, rushed, many questions, few questions) to determine that the client can perform well under all of these conditions. Whenever deficits are noted in the client\\'s performance, further training can be conducted. As with other forms of skill-training, it is important that contact be maintained as the client attempts to use new skills in the natural environment. Clients can be asked to keep notes on actual job interviews they encounter, any difficult questions they were asked, whether they used the skills that had been previously trained, and so on. The therapists\\'s role at this point includes reinforcing client reports of skill-usage and providing additional training when it appears necessary. Stylistic Aspects of Self-Presentation in Job Interviews Although job-interview training teaches clients to incorporate various verbal and nonverbal components in their handling of an interview, the therapist observing a client\\'s practice role-plays should remain cognizant of the style of the client\\'s behavior as well. The \"Pause-Think-Speak\" training approach described by Hollandsworth et al. (1978) can be used throughout training on individual verbal components to assist clients in briefly and covertly organizing 214 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions their responses to an interviewer\\'s questions before they begin to respond, Similarly, clients should be encouraged not to simply memorize answers to particular interview questions, but to grasp certain response \"rules,\" These rules might include: when asked about one\\'s work experience, to talk about one\\'s major past jobs and, for each job, to be certain to include such information as the name of the employer, one\\'s job title, several specific responsibilities or accomplishments, and something positive that one enjoyed in that position, Several research studies on job-interview training have had experienced personnel managers listen to clients\\' pretreatment and posttreatment role-plays and evaluate them on global, subjective criteria ofeffectiveness (see Barbee & Keil, 1973; Furman etal\" 1979; Kelly, Wildman, & Berler, 1980). In research studies, utilizing such external judgments can serve to establish the social validity of behavioral change, However, this is also a potentially useful prcedure for clinical and applied interventions. A therapist, with the client\\'s permission, might enlist the assistance of an individual who has actual experience interviewing job-applicants and ask that person to listen to a tape recording of the client\\'s practice role-play from late in the training intervention, The personnel interviewer\\'s comments and reactions to the role-play interview can be obtained and, if it is evident that areas of deficiency remain, additional training can be conducted, Finally, there may be certain difficult or \"critical\" interview questions that some clients will encounter and that will require particular attention in training. This might include questions about work experience (if a client has none), why one left his or her last job (if the client was fired), why one hasn\\'t worked recently (if the client has been chronically unemployed, insitutionalized, or incarcerated), and so on. Each of these interviewer questions has the potential of eliciting extremely detrimental responses from the client who handles it poorly or has failed to practice skilled responses to such difficult questions, Some training-session time can be devoted to handling such questions, depending upon whether the client\\'s background makes it likely that he or she will encounter them, In general, it would seem best that clients learn to never spontaneously provide information to an interviewer that will be potentially damaging to their chances of being hired. Thus, clients should not offer information about past work problems, terminations, emotional problems, and the like. On the other hand, if specifically asked by an interviewer (or under circumstances where the interviewer will obviously know about such events), a client can respond honestly by very briefly summarizing the past problem, and then always elaborating accurate reasons why the client is now responsible, ambitious, able to work, an asset to the potential employer, and so on. Therapist instruction, modeling, rehearsal, and feedback can be used to teach responses to critical questions, just as these principles are used throughout job-interview training, Chapter 10 Social-Skills Training with Children It is only in the comparatively recent past that the treatment of social-skill deficits in children has received systematic clinical and research attention (Michelson & Wood, 1980). Perhaps one reason for this is that children who are skills-deficient often remain unnoticed and in the background within their classrooms, daycare programs, or neighborhood playgrounds. While disruptive, aggressive, and \"hyperactive\" behavior readily draws the attention of parents, teachers and, ultimately, therapists, the isolated child with few peer relationships may go quietly unnoticed and unreferred for treatment. A second likely reason for the paucity of past attention to children\\'s social-skill deficits is that many therapists simply did not know how to deal effectively with the sociallyisolatedchild. Aswewillsee,many ofthebehaviorsthatcontributeto socially skilled behavior in childhood (such as prosocial play) are qualitatively different than elements of interpersonal competence exhibited in adult interactions. Until peer-valued social competencies in childhood could be clearly identified, and procedures for teaching them those skills investigated, the development of effective training techniques was correspondingly hindered. Remediating social-skill inadequacies during childhood is important for a variety of reasons. Certainly one of the foremost is to increase the happiness, self-esteem, and peer-adjustment of the child as a child. However, as we noted in Chapter 2, it appears likely that socially skilled behavior during childhood is also a prerequisite for the development and elaboration of an individual\\'s later interpersonal repertoire. Ifa child lacks peer-valued play and interaction skills in early life, he or she will have less close interpersonal contact with others as time goes on. By virtue of reduced peer-contact, opportunities will also be weaker to naturalistically observe, practice, and be reinforced for the acquisition of new and more complex social skills. Early-life skill-deficits might then perpetuate circumstances of continued social isolation, which precludes the learning of additional skills. A number of investigators have found, through longitudinal study, that poor peer acceptance in childhood is associated with a wide variety of serious later-life difficulties, including: adjudication for delin215 216 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions quent acts (Roff, Sells, & Golden, 1972); dropping out of school (Ullman, 1957); receiving conduct discharges from military service (Roff, 1961); and utilizing the services ofcommunity mental health centers in adulthood (Cowen, Pederson, Babigian, Izzo, & Trost, 1973). While we have termed this chapter \"Social-Skills Training with Children,\" it is important to bear in mind that socially skilled behavior among children is not a unitary, generalized trait; there are undoubtedly different forms of interpersonal competency in childhood, just as there are in adulthood. Further, skill behavior is also likely to be situationally determined, and may depend upon such factors as the age and sex of the child; the age, sex, and familiarity of the other peers in an interaction; where the interaction occurs (at home, during structured classroom activities, on a playground, etc.); and the nature of the social interaction itself (playing an outside recess game, initiating play with others, talking with a friend, working collaboratively on a school project, handling a disagreement. and so on). Somewhat different types of skillbehaviors may be needed under each of these circumstances. Some investigatorshavetargetedforinterventionrelativelyspecifictypes ofsocialskill, which parallel corresponding skill in adults, including refusal assertiveness when others attempt to take advantage of the child (Bomstein. Bellack. & Hersen, 1977) and effectively praising the positive behavior of peers (Warren, Baer, & Rogers-Warren, 1979). More typically, the aim of skills-training interventions has been to increase the general frequency of peer interaction of formerly isolated children, or to increase their popularity based on sociometric (peer nominations of popularity) indices (Foster & Ritchey, 1979). This is usually accomplished by teaching interpersonally deficient children the competencies deemed important for initiating and then maintaining peer interactions in cooperative play and play-plus-conversation, and in unstructured interactions. It is this aspect of childhood social skills that will be the focus of attention of this chapter. Child Populations for Social-Skills Training As we might expect. the children that have received greatest attention in the skills-training literature are those who appear to have low rates of peer interaction, based on behavioral observation in the natural setting or on peer sociometric measures. Interventions have most frequently targeted isolated preschoolers, in some cases including children as young as three years old (Evers & Schwarz. 1973) and those from disadvantaged backgrounds (Kirschenbaum, 1979; Geller & Scheirer, 1978). Other successful projects have been reported with isolated children in various elementrary-school grades (See Weinrott. Corson, & Wilchesky, 1979; LaGreca & Santogrossi, 1980; Gottman. Gonso, & Schuler. 1976; Beder. Kelly, & Romanczyk, 1980). Although social isolation and lack of interaction with peers have been 217 Social-Skills Training with Children client-selection criteria for many skills-training projects with children, other studies have taught interpersonal skills to children who were highly disruptive, aggressive, and uncooperative during their peer interactions (see Bomstein, Bellack, & Hersen, 1980; Durlak & Mannarino, 1977; Filipczak, Archer, & Friedman, 1980; Zahavi & Asher, 1978). The rationale for skills-training here is that aggressive children, in addition to social isolates, often seem to lack the prosocial repertoire of appropriate behaviors needed to establish cooperative peer relationships. Other interventions with children have focused on the developmentally handicapped (McDaniel, 1970; Strain, Shores, & Timm, 1977; Strain & Tirnm, 1974), since retarded and language-delayed children are likely to experience particular difficulty establishing appropriate social relationships with peers. It has been suggested that developmentally handicapped children who are \"mainstreamed\" into integrated classrooms often lack the peer-valued interpersonal skills necessary to develop friendships with their nonretarded peers and, as a result, remain socially isolated (Kelly, Furman, Phillips, Hathorn, & Wilson, 1979). Skills-training with this population may prove quite useful. In a similar vein, children with leaming disabilities and concurrent interpersonal skill-deficits have received attention in the socialskills training literature (Cooke & Apolloni, 1976; LaGreca & Mesibov, 1979). From a clinical perspective, training in social skills is indicated in those cases where a child lacks the abilities to enter into and maintain participation during positive interactions with peers. This might be manifested in any of several ways,including: (1)simplenoninvolvementwithpeers, lack ofparticipationin other children\\'s activities, and the absence of friends; (2) being actively rebuffed or rejected by others when social initiations are attempted; or (3) an aggressive, belligerent interaction style, when this is due to inadequacies in the child\\'s prosocial-skills repertoire. After reviewing the behavioral makeup of socially skilled interactions in children, we will direct our attention to procedures for the clinical assessment of these social-skill deficits in more detail. Components of Social Skill Among Children A number of different verbal and motor behaviors have been identified as components necessary to initiate and maintain cooperative social relationships in childhood. However, the manner in which these behaviors have been identified varies considerably. Some investigators have administered sociometric measures to an entire group of children (such as a class) and asked each child to select his or her best friends, so that popular and unpopular individuals within the group could be identified. Then, the popular and unpopular children are observed during social and play interactions to determine those specific verbal and nonverbal behaviors that distinguish between the two groups (see Hartup, Glazer, & Charlesworth, 1967; Gottman, Gonso, & 218 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions Rasmussen, 1975). In other cases, the process is essentially reversed. Here, children are ftrst taught to exhibit behaviors that a therapist intuitively feels comprisesocialcompetence,andtheeffect oftheintervention, andpresumably the effect of the new behaviors being exhibited by the child, are evaluated in terms of improved sociometric standing or more frequent rates of interaction with peers (see Gottman et aI., 1976; LaGreca & Santogrossi, 1980). Even when such empirical procedures are used to identify components of social skill among children, certain problems remain. As Foster and Ritchey (1979) have pointed out, some investigators have dermed social competence in terms of sociometrically measured popularity, while others have used criteria such as the extent or overall quality of observed social interactions with peers. The behaviors that comprise one deftnition of social skill may not be equally related to another. Also, because differing skill-behaviors are needed for different types of peer interactions, those skill-behaviors used in one situation (meeting a new schoolmate) are not necessarily. the same as those used in another (playing a group game at recess). The age of a child is also related to behaviors that will be judged as socially competent; in early childhood, the skills needed to initiate and maintain play-behavior are very important, whereas in later childhood, conversational verbal content becomes increasingly salient. Although such issues involve assessment research, they also bear on clinical treatment, since it is important to ensure that we teach children those skillcomponent behaviors that will actually increase their peer-adjustment (Foster & Ritchey, 1979). With these qualiftcations in mind, speciftc components that have been related to social skill in childhood include: greetings; social initiations; asking questions and answering questions; praise; proximity and orientation; task participation or playing; cooperation or sharing; and affective responsiveness. Let us now examine these components in more detail. Greetings are verbal statements that precede an interaction and acknowledge, in a positive manner, the peer whom the child sees. Verbal greetings need not be long or elaborate (\"Hi, John\"; \"How are you, Sue\"; \"Hey-it\\'s the Champ!\") and simply serve as positive signals that the child recognizes the presence of the peer. Social initiations are verbal behaviors, often accompanied by movement toward peers, which a child uses to begin interacting with others. Social initiations may include inviting others to join in one\\'s own activity, or joining into the activities of other children. In either case, they serve to initiate the child\\'s involvement with peers and increase the opportunities for social participation. Examples of appropriate social initiations include verbal statements like \"Hi, John. Do you want to play cards with me?\"; \"Can I play on your team?\"; \"Let\\'s go swimming!\"; \"I\\'d like to be in your group\"; \"Why don\\'t you get on the swing and I\\'ll push you?\" Although some of these statements are phrased as questions, they primarily serve to communicate the child\\'s interest Social-Skills Training with Children 219 in beginning some mutual activity with another child. They are often accompanied by motor behaviors such as walking toward another child, holding out a toy, or so on. Asking and answering questions are conversational behaviors that facilitate the development of peer relationships in the same manner that they contribute to conversational competence in adults. Gottman et al. (1975), for example, found that the frequency of eliciting information from peers (asking questions) and providing information about oneself to them (anS\\\\dering questions) differentiated popular and unpopular children. It would appear that ideal conversational questions are those that are open-ended and do not yield simple \"yes-no\" answers (\"What\\'s your favorite T.V. show?\"; \"What did you do on vacationthissummer?\";\"Whatdoesyourbigbrotherdo?\"). Similarly, answers to questions from other children should be fully elaborated and convey information about one\\'s own hobbies, activities, and so on (Gottman et al., 1975; LaGreca & Mesibov, 1979). Praise consists of compliments directed to a peer when the other child has done something well. In essence, the child who develops the ability of praising his or her peers will be an effective dispenser of reinforcement to them (LaGreca & Mesibov, 1979); this role has been associated with increased popularity in several studies (Gottman et al., 1975; Hartup, 1970). Examples of this verbal behavior might include: \"That\\'s a neat model you made\"; \"I like your shirt\"; \"You\\'re a good basketball player\"; or \"Terrific!\" Proximity and orientation refer to the physical location of the target child in relation to other children with whom he or she might interact. Clearly, if a child is physically distanced from others, almost any form of social interaction will be impossible. Proximity to peers, then, represents a necessary but in itself insufficient prerequisite for socially skilled behavior to occur. In addition to the child\\'s nearness to peers, orientation toward them (looking, attending, and so on) is a basic requirement for skilled behavior. Proximity in a playroom setting would be considered present if the child were sitting with others, and was oriented toward their activity; it would be deficient if the child was standing ten feet away from the location of other children and was not attending to their activities. Task participation or playing denotes a child\\'s active interaction with peers in the context of some shared activity or task. Many behavioral definitionsofplayhavebeenproposed, butwe willbeconcernedhereonlywithwhat has been termed \"associative\" or \"cooperative\" play. In cooperative play, two or more children are engaged in a mutual task that involves the reciprocation of motor behavior or talk and, consequently, interaction with one another. The 220 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions play task itself can vary greatly; playing tag, checkers, cleaning a fish tank, working on a collaborative art project, looking through a book, or singing can each be examples of cooperative play, provided the children are mutually interacting during it. Associative or cooperative play can be distinguished from \"solitary play,\" where one child alone engages in a task alone (e.g., bouncing a ball or working alone on a project); it can also be distinguished from what has been termed \"parallel play,\" where children are playing in close physical proximity, but without actually interacting with one another in the process. Cooperation or sharing behavior can occur in the context of task-play or conversation among children. This component refers specifically to a child taking turns, offering assistance, sharing a play-object with another child, following game rules, and similar acts (see LaGreca & Mesibov, 1979). When observing children at work on an arts-and-crafts project, one might see a child offer a crayon to a peer or say \"Let me help you.\" Each of these is an example of the cooperation or sharing component of social skill. Affective responsiveness refers to the child\\'s emotional demeanor while interacting with others. Smiling, laughter, and affectionate touching at appropriate times are elements of affective responsiveness. Ifa child meets and is playing with peers but shows no visible signs of emotional enjoyment, one would evaluate affective responsiveness as being deficient. Just as for other types of social skills in adults, we can define interpersonal skillamongchildreninterms ofthepresence ofthesecomponent-behaviors. To the extent that they are exhibited during the course of interactions with peers, we can consider a child to be skillful; to the extent that these behaviors are not exhibited, the child is likely to experience difficulties in interactions with others. Assessment of Children\\'s Social Skills Preceding the Training Intervention Clinical assessment of a child\\'s social skills begins by carefully interviewing persons in a position to comment on the child\\'s peer-interaction behavior, based on their own direct observation of him or her. Ordinarily, these individuals will be the child\\'s parents, teachers, daycare center staff, and so on. The purpose of this initial interview assessment is the same as the preliminary interview of an adult client: to obtain information on specific situations in which the child experiences difficulties in peer interaction, and to obtain information about how the child currently behaves in those situations. The training intervention will be focused on those identified interactions. It is important for the therapist to gain descriptions of particular peerSocial- Skills Training with Children 221 interaction situations, rather than generalized traits ascribed to the child. For example, the teacher of an elementary-school-age child might tell the therapist that a child is \"shy\" or \"introverted,\" and rarely joins in peer activities. However, this description alone is insufficient information for treatmentplanning. We would then need to determine those specific situations in which the teacher has observed the child to act shyly with classmates, exactly where the teacher has observed the child to act shyly with classmates, and exactly what the teacher means when she describes the child\\'s behavior in this way. Similarly global descriptions such as \"poor social relationships,\" \"bossy,\" \"isolated,\" and so on are generalized labels that must be translated into more specific descriptions of actual interactions in which the child has experienced difficulty and of how the child behaves with others in them. Because parents, teachers, and other informants may be unable to provide sufficiently detailed information in a single interview, between contacts with the therapist they can be encouraged to keep brief notes of any situation in which they observe peer-interaction difficulties. These notes should always include information about the setting where peer diffICulties were observed (in the backyard, on the playground at recess, during a group game at school, working on an arts and crafts project, etc.), what the child did in that situation, who the other peers were, and how the peers responded to the child. The child can also be interviewed; the quality and amount of information obtained from the interview will depend upon the age and verbal level of the child. Areas that can be pursued in this discussion might include: peer activities that the child enjoys or does not enjoy; whether the child has \"best friends\" and, if so, who they are, what they do together, and why the child considers them to be best friends; how the child prefers to spend free time; whether the child feels liked, \"picked-on,\" or ignored by others; and so on. The therapist should also note any appearance, dress, or mannerism factors that may adversely affect the child\\'s social relationships and that can receive attention during the intervention. Although they are not social skills per se, such things as extreme obesity, unattractive or unstylish dress, thick glasses, or obvious speech impediments may impact negatively on peer acceptance and are potentially modifiable. When the therapist has carefully interviewed informants in the child\\'s environment and determined those situations that appear problematic, it is desirable to objectively observe the child\\'s social behavior. Behavioral Assessment of Child Social Competency There are three methods through which a therapist can directly observe a child\\'s social skills. These are by constructing role-plays of troublesome interactions, observing the child\\'s interaction with peers during a contrived social task in the clinic setting, or observing the child\\'s behavior with peers in the natural environment. While the purpose of pretreatment behavioral assessment is the 222 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions same for each ofthese procedures, and is to identify skill components in which the child is deficient, the three assessment methods differ in terms of the time they require and the quantity of treatment-related information they can yield. Assessment Role-Plays Here, the therapist analyzes the interview-data collected from parents, teachers, or other informants and constructs approximations of identified troublesome situations so that they can be role-played with the child in the clinic setting. This behavioral assessment procedure is quite similar to that used in adult social-skills assessment. and the interaction partner is either an adult confederate or the therapist. In some cases, the assessment can take the form of structured role-plays. Bomstein et a1. (1977). to assess children\\'s assertive skills, required them to interact with an adult who played the part of a child antagonist in each of the scenes. Geller et a1. (1980) also used a role-play format for assessing the skill of a retarded young adolescent to respond to the positive and antagonistic advances of peers; an adult partner played the part of the adolescent peer in the role-play scenes. Play interactions can be assessed similarly. For example, an adult confederate or the therapist could playa game or work on a project with the child to evaluate the client\\'s social skills in that type ofinteraction. The particular game or task should correspond to a peer interaction with which the child is reported to experience difficulties, and the task should be one that requires skillcomponent behaviors to be handled effectively. The adult partner plays the role of a peer in that situation. and the child client\\'s behavior during the interaction is rated to assess the presence of social-skill components. Unfortunately. there are a number of methodological and validity problems associated with in-clinic role-play forms of behavioral assessment with children. While the therapist can construct assessment situations that parallel genuinely troublesome interactions in the child\\'s natural environment. it is oftendifficulttorealisticallyduplicate many aspects ofthe in-vivoenvironment (the presence of other peers, a classroomlike environment, and so on). Perhaps more importantly, a child\\'s social behavior towards peers is frequently not correlated with that child\\'s social behavior towards adults (Hartup, 1970; Hartup, 1976; Masters & Furman, 1977). Therefore. when a child role-plays assessment conversations. games, or joining an interaction with an adult partner. the observed behavior may not be at all representative of that child\\'s performance in comparable interactions with other children. It can also be quite difficult for adults to realistically behave as a child would during assessment interactions. further limiting the validity of information derived from interactions with adult partners. For these reasons, a much more desirable skillsformat is to utilize other children in assessment interactions. Social-Skills Training with Children 223 Contrived Interactions with Peers In this skills-assessment procedure, the therapist constructs tasks that provide the opportunity for the child client to interact with other children. For example, to examine a child\\'s peer-interaction skills during a cooperative play task, the therapist might bring two or more children (at least one whom is a client child) into a playroom and ask them to work together on a puzzle, play \"house\" together, work with one another on an arts and crafts project, and so on. The play task should be similar to an interaction in which the client child appears to lack appropriate social skills, and it should be a task that provides the opportunity for all of the previously identified component-behaviors to occur. As the interaction between the children takes place, the therapist unobtrusively observes and rates the behavior of the client child for skill componentbehaviors. Depending on the length of the play task, several tasks can be presented in a single assessment session, and the child\\'s behavior can be rated in each. Who might serve as peers in the play interaction? One possibility is that other children who are also skills-deficient can interact with one another. If groupskills training is planned, several of the client children can be placed together in the playroom and the behavior ofeach can be observed. As we will see, having skills-deficient children interact with one another is not only a useful procedure for the pretraining behavioral assessment ofeach child, but also can serve as an effective vehicle for the practice or rehearsal of skills that will occur in subsequent training-sessions. When assessment interactions with other skillsdeficient children are used, the therapist should be aware that the observed social behavior may not correspond with the behavior that a given child exhibits during interactions with more skilled peers. In spite of this limitation, the procedure may prove quite useful, especially when group training is anticipated. It is also possible to observe a child\\'s play interactions with socially skilled peers. This, of course, requires access to other children who can serve as interactors. If an assessment interaction is conducted at a school, daycare center, or similar facility, this should prove to be little problem. One can place the child client and one or two other children in a location somewhat removed from everyone else, present them with play tasks, and closely observe the behavior of the client child during the interaction. The validity of this assessment format would seem especially high if the other peers in the interaction are genuineclassmates oftheclientchild, perhapsevenpeerswithwhomthechild has difficulty playing cooperatively and actively. The client child\\'s own right to confidentiality need not be jeopardized, since the other children do not have to be aware thatthe purpose ofthe play is specifically to assess the clientchild\\'s social skills. 224 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions Assessment Observations in the Natural Environment A final procedure for behavioral assessment of children\\'s social skills is observing them in the natural environment itself. The setting for observation would be the school classroom, playground, daycare center, or other environment in which peer difficulties appear to occur, based upon information collected in earlier interviews. When in-vivo assessments are made, the therapist can either observe the child client as he or she interacts with peers as a part ofthe normal activities ofthe setting or, alternatively, the therapist can arrange for some planned activity (a game, task, cooperative project) to take place so the child can be observed in it. The advantage of the latter approach is that the therapist, who will be observing for only a relatively short period, seeks to assess the child\\'s behavior in situations where social skills with peers are actually required. If one simply visited a school or daycare center at some random, unplanned time, it is quite possible that the observations would take place at a \"noncritical\" point, when children are engaged in individual assignments and are not actively interacting, during nap-time, and so on. Consequently, almost no useful information would be obtained. A much more desirable approach is for the therapist to pinpoint, based on information obtained through interviews, those situations when the child\\'s peer-interaction problems are most likely to be evident. The therapist could either arrange to observe those particular activities as they occur naturally in the setting (e.g., observing the child at recess time, during free-play periods, and so on), or could ask that a similar peer task be planned for when the therapist arrives. Because it takes place in the natural environment, in-vivo client-assessment can be very useful; the child client\\'s interactions with real-life peers can be directly observed in the setting where problems genuinely occur. The major limitation is one oftime, since it requires that the therapist actually travel to the setting. However, thequantityandquality oftreatment-relatedinformationthat can be obtained in this manner are sufficient to justify in-vivo observations in many cases. Rating Observed Interactions for the Presence of Skill-Components The task of the therapist observing a child\\'s peer interactions is to evaluate whether, and how adequately, the child exhibits those behaviors that contribute to social skill. Figure 10.1 presents a sample form that the therapist can use to rate the presence of the skill-components we reviewed earlier. We will assume that the therapist is observing a child client who is in a situation in which he or she can play or talk with others, and that the interaction is continuing over some period of time (5 minutes, 10 minutes, and so on). The most basic assessment rating-procedure is for the therapist to simply tally Social-Skills Training with Children 225 whenever one of the identified skill-behaviors is exhibited by the child under observation. This will yield frequency counts for the discrete components of social initiations, sharing, asking or answering questions, making praise statements, and so on. However, several important component-behaviors, such as proximity and task participation or playing, are not discrete behaviors that can be tallied so easily. If a child received a tally-mark for playing, but did so for only 3 seconds, it would signify something quite different than a tally-mark for playing that continued over 2 minutes. The therapist has several options for FIGURE 10.1 Sample Rating-Form for Child\\'s Social Interactions Child Name: _ Date of This Interaction: _ Description of Setting Where Observation Was Made: Length of Interaction Rated Here: __ Type of Interaction: Pretraining Assessment Session Practice (Training Focused on What Component? , Follow-up COMPONENT BEHAVIORS 1.

Cooperation/Sharing (Tally of total number of incidents of cooperative or sharing behavior observed) Frequency Count: Total: _ (continued) 226 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions rating behaviors such as proximity and task participation or playing. The easiest, albeit least precise, is estimating the percentage of time when the child engaged in play interactions or was in close proximity to at least one peer after the observation period was completed. This is similar to the method used to estimate an adult client\\'s average eye-contact over the course ofsome role-play interaction. Ifthe therapist wishes to measure more precisely the amount of time when a child was interacting with peers in play, a cumulative stopwatch can be activated whenever an episode of play begins and it can be stopPt?d whenever play terminates. Similarly, proximity can be more accurately assessed by timing the periods when the child client is within some fixed distance (perhaps three feet) of any other child. Whether this finer-grained assessment is needed depends principally upon the behavioral precision sought by the therapist. The components included in the sample rating-form (Figure 10.1) should not be considered a comprehensive list of all child social behaviors that can be rated, and the therapist observing a child\\'s interaction may wish to make note of other behaviors that occur in the session. For example, a given child might fail to make eye contact when talking to peers; if this were casually observed, the therapist could add a more formalized eye-contact component category to the list of behaviors. Children may also exhibit socially undesirable behaviors during peer interactions, such as hitting, grabbing objects from others, making \"bossy\" comments, responding to peer rejection during play by crying, and so on. Any potentially relevant aspects of a child\\'s social behavior should be rated by the therapist who observes the interaction, so that they can also be given later treatment attention. (continued) 6.

This can be accomplished most easily by using a single rating-form and simply tallying every instance of a component behavior with the letter of the child\\'s name who exhibited it. For example, if Susan directed a question to a peer, it would be tallied \"S\"; if Mary asked a question, it could be recorded in the same category with an \"M.\" At the end of the assessment observation period, separate frequencies or ratings for each child on each component could be easily derived. Behavior of the Therapist while Observing Children\\'s Social Interactions Whether children\\'s social behavior is being observed with peers in the natural environment setting Or using peer-play tasks in a clinic, it is important that the therapist observing them not disrupt the interaction through his or her presence. If the therapist can watch the interaction surreptitiously, such as through a one-way mirror, this is ideal. Often, especially during the in-vivo observations that take place in classrooms, daycare centers\\' playrooms, or playgrounds, entirely surreptitious assessment is impossible. The task of the therapist is to remain far enough from the children to avoid eliciting reactions to the observer, yet close enough to reliably evaluate the child client\\'s behavior. It is useful for the therapist to act somewhat detached from the children who are being observed, avoiding direct eye contact, talk, or even smiles. Observation should be as unobtrusive as possible; the interaction between the therapist and child client will occur later, as a part of training. It is extremely desirable for child-assessment observations to be repeated on several different occasions. This provides a more stable initial baseline of the child\\'s social skills and can give the therapist a better subjective \"feel\" of the child\\'s social skills on different occasions, perhaps during different interaction or play tasks, and perhaps with different peers. By the end of pretreatment assessment, the therapist will then be in a position to evaluate the behavioral ratings made ofthe child\\'s interactions and identifythose skill-components that will require particular attention in training. Skills-Training Procedures with Children The treatment principles of a social-skills training intervention for children are virtually identical to those incorporated in training for adults. A number of analogue research studies have demonstrated that even relatively brief, onesession exposure of socially deficient children to a single element oftreatment, 228 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions such as a modeling videotape, can exert a positive influence on their socialskills behavior with peers (see O\\'Connor, 1969; 1972); however, it appears more desirable to consolidate various learning-theory procedures within training sessions, to conduct treatment over multiple sessions, and to focus on deficientskill-components insequential andcumulativefashion overthe course of the intervention. Specifically, modeling, coaching/instructions, behavioral practice, and the provision of feedback and reinforcement following practice are all elements of treatment to improve children\\'s interpersonal skills. As was the case with adult training, therapist attention must then be focused on bringingaboutuse ofnewskillsinthenaturalenvironment. Letusnow turn our attention to how sessions can be conducted, first when only a single child is treated and then for group social-skills training of children. Social-Skills Training with One Child Treatment sessions for a child can begin with a short period of informationprovision and discussion by the therapist about the behavioral component that willbereceivingattentioninthatsession. Thepurpose ofthisistointroducethe session\\'s purpose and to direct the child\\'s attention to a particular aspect of social skill. When the therapist discusses any skill-component behavior, it is always important that information be presented in a style and language appropriate to the child\\'s own age and level of verbal sophistication. For example, if one session\\'s targeted behavior is cooperation and sharing, the therapist might first inquire about the child\\'s activities in school that day and then provide specific illustrations of how cooperative acts and sharing with peers could occur in those activities. The child might be asked to identify occasions when he or she did share things with others, occasions when other children shared orcooperatively played with the child client, and why it is good to share. Exposure to a model who exhibits the skill-behavior is a second important aspectofthetrainingsession. Aswenotedinearlierchapters,thisexposurecan be either live (with the therapist modeling the desired behavior) or portrayed in a videotape presentation. Videotape Skills-Models The therapist who anticipates conducting frequent social-skills training interventions with children may wish to construct a modeling videotape for use in sessions. A typical film that could be used for various child clients might show child models engaged in different play and conversational activities, and exhibiting all components of skill during these interactions. For one example, one vignette might show two children playing a table game with each other Social-Skills Training with Children 229 while a third child (to whom the client\\'s attention will be directed) initially watches from a distance. The onlooker, after watching the others briefly, then approaches the two peers who are playing (illustrating proximity). After greeting each peer by name (greeting), the fonner onlooker might ask ifhe or she can join in their game (social initiation) and begin playing with them. Various other\\'skill-behaviors can then be demonstrated by the three models, including ongoing cooperative play, talking, answering, and asking conversational questions, sharing, laughing, and so on. This entire modeled interaction might last for five or ten minutes. Because the models exhibit all skillcomponents, the film could be used not only for each treatment session of a given child client, but for other skills-deficient children as well. Videotape modeling-films have been used successfully in many skillstraining projects with children (see Geller & Scheirer, 1978; Gottman, 1977; Gottman et aI., 1976; O\\'Connor, 1969, 1972). The advantages of using modeling videotapes include: (1) the fairly high reinforcement value to most childrenofwatchinga \"televisionlike\"film; (2) the presentation ofskill-models who are also children and may have greater salience than would an adult model to the child observing them; (3) the presentation ofrealistic interaction scenes, such as children at play in a classroom setting; and (4) greater procedural ease, with the therapist able to pause a modeling film at any point, discuss the model\\'s behavior as it occurs, and so on. Models used in the film should exhibit characteristics that are related to greater imitative leaming (same age as the child client, same sex, positive outcome achieved by the model, etc.). When the same film will be used for several clients, models ofdifferent sexes, races, and ages might be represented in the tape\\'s portrayed interactions. Construction ofa modeling film does require that the therapist have access to videotape-recording apparatus, children who can serve as actors in the tape, and a certain willingness to be a part-time film director. One\\'s own children, thechildren ofcolleagues, orafriendlyteacher atanearbyschool orchurchcan be good sources of modeling-film actors. Children\\'s modeling films need not be elaborately produced and they often represent a very reasonable investment in time, especially when other children will later be receiving similar socialskills training. Live-Modeling by the Therapist The adult therapist can also serve as a skills model for the socially deficient child. Informally, this includes providing examples of the targeted verbal components in the session. Iftwo therapists are present, they can role-playa live-modeled interaction with one another and with the children observing them in an episode of conversation or \"play.\" When only one therapist is present in the session, the therapist and the child could interact together, with the trainer 230 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions playing the part of a socially skilled child and demonstrating the correct use of skill-behaviorsashe orsheinteractswiththechild. Thus, ifthetherapistmodel and the child playa game with one another, the child\\'s attention is specifically focused on the manner in which the therapist greets the child at the interaction\\'s start, walks over and verbally initiates a request to play, asks or answers questions while playing, shares play objects, and so on. Following modeling-exposure, the child is verbally directed or \"coached\" to use the behavior receiving attention in the session. In this coaching phase, the therapist can variously provide more examples of the target behavior, suggest times in a social interaction when its use would be appropriate, or ask the child to generate specific examples of the behavior (see Asher, Oden, & Gottman, 1977; Gottman et al., 1976; Kelly, Furman, Phillips, Hatborn, & Wilson, 1979; LaGreca & Mesibov, 1979; LaGreca & Santogrossi, 1980). The aim of directive coaching is to ensure that the child now understands the behavioral concept under attention and seems able to exhibit it. At this point in the session, behavior rehearsal can occur. Procedures for skills-rehearsal with children correspond to the format used in an adult\\'s training. Specifically, a child\\'s in-session practice should approximate the kinds of situations in which that child actually experiences peer difficulties; rehearsal also requires the presence of one or more partners, with whom the child client can interact. Ideally, a child\\'s practice partners will be other children; less desirably, but certainly better than having no practice, the child can interact with an adult (the therapist or a therapist confederate), who plays the part of a peer in the rehearsal period. Peers as Interaction Practice-Partners A number of social-skills training projects with children have had the skillsdeficient child interact with peers, both to serve as a vehicle for session practice and to allow the therapist to objectively evaluate whether the child exhibits the targeted component during peer interactions (see Beder et al., 1980; LaGreca & Mesibov, 1979; Strain & Timm, 1974; Strain et al., 1977). In general, those tasks used for skills-practice with peers have involved relatively unstructured play activities, such as games, art projects, and so on. As an example, a young child who is receiving social-skills training can be brought into a playroom area following the phase ofthe training session that included instructions, modeling, and coaching on some social behavior. One or two other children might also be in the playroom setting, and the child client is instructed to play with them and practice using the newly acquired skills during the play period. A therapist observing the interaction can rate the client child\\'s play behavior with the other childrenforasetperiod oftime(suchas5minutes or10minutes). Immediately after the practice interaction, the therapist can meet with the child and discuss Social-Skills Training with Children 231 whether the behavioral components were exhibited, providing feedback and praise to the child for their use. Utilizing other children as practice-play partners requires that peers be available to serve in this role. When training is conducted within a setting where other children are present, such as at a school or daycare center, this can be accomplished quite readily. Children who will interact with the client child can be either naive interactors or can function more as therapist confederates in play. If they are naive interactors, the peers might simply be told that they will be playing a game with other children (one of whom is the client child). On the other hand, they might be told that they will be playing with another child and part of their \"job\" is to help the other child feel comfortable with them, allow the child to join them, ask and answer questions with him, and so on. The latter approach helps to ensure that the child\\'s practice-interaction will be positive and that skill-usage will actually be reinforced by peers in the practiceinteraction. As we will see when we consider group social-skills training, children can easily serve as practice-play partners with one another. This obviates the need for locating additional peers and permits each child in a play interaction to rehearse the skill-behaviors that are receiving training attention. The Therapist or Therapist Confederate as an Interaction Practice-Partner Here, skills-rehearsal does not occur during play or conversation with peers, but rather with the adult therapist or a confederate of the therapist. Depending upon the situation being rehearsed, the child and adult partner might have a conversation (with the partner playing the part of a child at school), work on a puzzle or game together, practice interactions in which the child client asks the partner to join him in games or activities, and so on. The interactions used in practice should correspond to situations that the child needs to handle more effectively in the natural environment and that permit the exhibition of the specific skill-components that are receiving attention in that session. Avariation ofthis rehearsal technique that has been used by me withyounger children entails role-playing with hand puppets. In it, the child wears a hand puppet that represents himself or herself, while the therapist wears one or two puppets who represent other children. In most cases, the other children represented by the therapist\\'s puppets are actually named for peers in the child\\'s environment (classmates, children in the daycare center, siblings, or neighbor children) and the situations being rehearsed are actual situations that the child client does not handle skillfully. Following instructions, modeling, and coaching in the session, puppet rehearsal permits the child to practice handling those interactions. For example, one 5-year-old boy had difficulty joining in game activities with two other boys who sat at his table at school. To rehearse 232 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions ways of initiating play activities with them, the therapist instructed the client to imagine that the two named peers were working on a game at the desk they all shared at school; the puppets were those peers. Then, the child client\\'s puppet practiced social initiations by moving the puppet toward the other two and speaking as he would in that situation (greeting the others, asking to join them, cooperatively playing, and so on). Since the therapist controls the peer puppets and vocalizes for them, it is possible to ensure that positive \"peer\" consequences are achieved in the situations that are practiced. Feedback, suggestions, and praise can be provided by the therapist following each situation rehearsed in this way. While the rehearsal techniques considered here do involve interaction be tween the therapist and child in conversation or play, they do not represent unstructured \"play therapy\" as the term is traditionally used. First, rehearsal procedures are approximations of very specific types of social interactions that prove troublesome for the child in the natural environment. Second, the rehearsal is handled in a directive manner, with the child explicitly taught to exhibit behavioral skill-components during the practice. Rehearsal is followed by specific feedback, praise, and additional instruction with further practice if that is needed. Finally, when skillbehaviors are exhibited during session practice, the therapist establishes a behavioral plan to facilitate their generalization to peer interactions occurring in the in-vivo environment. Generalization of Skills-Training Effects In social-skills training with adult clients, procedures to foster the use of new skill behaviors in the natural environment involve cognitive modification, self-monitoring of specific situations where skills could be used (or were exhibited), and so on. Some of the generalization techniques appropriate for adults are also useful with older children. However, it is important (and usually possible) to arrange more specific and direct positive contingencies for socially skilled behavior among children. Let us consider several ways that this skills generalization can be encouraged. Establishment of In-Vivo Situations That Permit Skill Usage We have already noted that the social-skills training intervention should be focused on those kinds of situations where a given child experiences peerinteraction problems. Thus, the child who is observed to have difficulty playing cooperatively with peers will receive training (and will practice interactions) addressing that type of social situation. However, it is necessary to ensure not only that treatment focuses on a child\\'s real interaction problems, but also that Social~Skills Training with Children 233 ample opportunities be created in the natural environment for skill-usage to occur once training takes place. This is important because a fonnerly isolated or socially unskilled child may be excluded by peers and have fewer naturally occurring opportunities to apply his newly acquired skills. One of the best ways to ensure that the child has opportunities to use new skills is through close, frequent collaboration between the therapist and the child\\'s teachers or parents. As an example, a child with deficits in the skills needed for cooperative play may have a training session in which more effective play-behaviors are discussed, modeled, coached, and practiced. However, unless there are also opportunities to use those behaviors with real peers at school or at home, it is unlikely the new skills will be established in the child\\'s in-vivo repertoire. Therefore, the therapist might contact the child\\'s teacher to apprise the teacher ofwhat occurred in that day\\'s training session and ask that the teacher attempt to \"set up\" opportunities for cooperative play at school. This might include assigning the child client to tasks or class projects with peers, designating the child to be captain of some team game at recess, making certain the child sits at a table with peers, and otherwise ensuring that the child will have planned opportunities to use the new skills. Similarly, the child\\'s parents can be instructed to arrange special play-activities between their child and peers or siblings. This might include inviting other children to their house,arrangingforgamesbetweenthechildclientandfriends orsiblings, and so on. As much as possible, it is desirable that when teachers orparents \"stage\" such interaction opportunities, they place the child with peers who are likely to be accepting of the child, rather than a class \"bully,\" who might punish the client child\\'s early attempts at skill-usage. Planned Reinforcement of the Child\\'s Skilled Behavior in the Natural Environment As a child exhibits new social skills, we expect that he or she will gradually experience greater peer acceptance, receive reciprocal positive behaviors from others, be involved in more rewarding activities, and so on. However, the natural peer-reinforcement contingencies may be insufficient to fully establish new skill-behaviors, especially for the child who has been socially deficient. Therefore, it is desirable to make certain that the child will be more consistently reinforced in the natural environment when he attempts to use the slQllbehaviors that have been acquired in training. Since the therapist is not usually in a position to observe the child\\'s daily in-vivo social interactions, and because reinforcement is most effective when it immediately follows the desired behavior, the assistance of teachers and parents must be enlisted. It is useful for the therapist to maintain regular contact with those adults in the child\\'s Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions environment who can observe and reinforce the child for exhibiting skillcomponent behaviors. This might take the form of weekly phone calls to a teacher, or discussions with the parents describing the specific behaviors that the child is learning. The adults can be asked to remain unobtrusively observant of the child\\'s peer-interactions at home or school, and alert to occasions when the child exhibits any behavior that has been trained. Praise should be provided whenever the child is observed to exhibit a socially skilled behavior. The child can be praised immediately after the behavior occurs, such as when a teacher praises the child client who has just approached and initiated play with others. However, the results ofseveral studies suggest that adult praise ofa child inthe midst of an intensive peer-interaction may actually disrupt that interaction (see Evers & Schwarz, 1973). Therefore, praise should be provided in such a fashion that it does not disrupt the child\\'s interaction or attract negative attention from the other children. Whenever feasible, the teacher or adult can be asked to keep brief behavioral monitoring records, which indicate how frequently the child exhibited socially skilled behaviors with peers. This can provide the therapist with objective data on the child\\'s behavior change in the natural environment. Finally, it is possible to implement a more structured behavior-reinforcement program, utilizing not only praise but also other rewards contingent on skilluse. As an example, the child who typically remains alone on a playground while her peers play might be reinforced for each 5-minute interval that she spends in close proximity to peers, or playing with them. Reinforcers used in such a system could include teacher praise plus special activities that the child enjoys, tangible rewards, and so on. Before such a structured program is implemented, it is of course important that the child first have learned the skills needed to interact with peers and thereby earn the reinforcers. Training Variations for Group Treatment As we noted earlier, it is often more feasible to conduct children\\'s social-skills training in small groups than with one individual child. A major advantage of group-administered training is that children can engage in practice playinteractions with one another during the sessions, eliminating the need for an adult therapist to play the part of a child in skills-practice, or the requirement that the therapist locate and arrange for peers to serve as play-partners during behavior rehearsal. In general, the format of each group training session parallels that of individual child sessions, incorporating the procedures of instruction, modeling, coaching, practice, and feedback/reinforcement to teach components of peer-interaction skill. During the rehearsal period, the group canbebroken down into smallergroups oftwoorthree for practice play such as working on a game, doing an art project, or conversing. Each child is instructed 235 Social-Skills Training with Children to exhibit the trained behaviors with his or her play-partners, and the therapist observing the practice-play can offer specific prompts, feedback, and praise to each child as the trained behaviors are exhibited. Several recent studies very nicely illustrate some procedures suitable for children\\'s group social-skills training (Cooke & Apolloni, 1976; LaGreca & Mesibov, 1979; LaGreca & Santogrossi, 1980). Because they are representative of the others, we will examine the procedures used by LaGreca and Santogrossi (1980). The purpose of the project was to evaluate the effectiveness ofa skills-training intervention and to compare it against no-treatment and minimal-treatment control groups. Children in this project were students in the third, fourth, andfifth grades ofanelementaryschoolwho, based onsociometric measures, were not well accepted nor liked by their peers. Social-skills training groups consisted of 5 same-sex children, and each was led by 2 co-therapists. The groups met weekly over 4 weeks; sessions lasted for 90 minutes and were conducted at the elementary school after regular school hours. The investigators targeted eight behaviors for training attention (smiling! laughing, greeting others, joining others, extending social invitations, conversational skills, sharing/cooperation, verbal complimenting, and physical appearance/grooming). Two components received attention in each training session. Sessions began with all children in the group watching a modeling videotape that showed peer models engaged in skillful social interactions and exhibiting the component-behaviors. In the tapes, the peer models were seen joining into activities with others, working on a group task assignment, and so on. Several different films were used and each lasted about four minutes. After modeling exposure, the co-therapists led a group discussion about the content of the tapes by asking the children to identify how the model used the targeted components, and how they themselves could use these skills in their own everyday interactions. The next phase of the treatment session involved coaching and behavior-rehearsal. The interactions used for session practice were based on actual situations that the children reported encountering at school. Examples included joining others in games at recess, cooperating with others in gym class activities, and so on. The therapists arranged for group members to simulate these play and social situations with each other and coached them to exhibit the component skill during their in-session practice. Feedback, reinforcement, and suggestions were provided after each practiceepisode. Additionally, the practice-interactions were videotaped and children observed replays of their just-completed practice. This videotape selfobservation was accompanied by therapist feedback; the children were also encouraged to critique positive aspects of one another\\'s practice, as well as areas still needing attention. Finally, children were given homework assignments that stressed utilizing the trained behaviors with peers (e.g., \"Greet a 236 Social-Skills Training: A Practical Guide for Interventions classmate at least once each day for the next week\"). Time in the next session was devoted to a review of each child client\\'s reported success with his or her homework assignments. LaGreca and Santogrossi (1980) were able to demonstrate that children who received skills-training improved significantly more than control-group children in their own knowledge of appropriate social skills, measured by using a test developed by the investigators. Skills-trained children also more frequently exhibited the trained-component behaviors during role-play interactions that simulated making friends with a new child at school, and their role-play performance was evaluated more favorably by adult observers on a global and subjective rating of social skill. Finally, the investigators had college students unobtrusively observe the children at times when they had the opportunity to engage in peer interactions at school, such as at recess, in gym class, and during club meetings. These in-vivo generalization ratings demonstrated that the children who had received skills-training initiated peer-interactions in these school settings more frequently after treatment than did the control group children. The well-conducted study by LaGreca and Santogrossi (1980) not only illustrates how behavioral skills-training principles can be applied to the group treatmentofsocially unpopularchildren, butalso provides impressiveevidence on the short-term effeotiveness of the intervention. Treatment in this project was relatively brief, consisting offour 9O-minute training sessions, and applied interventions may require an intervention of longer duration, especially for highly skills-deficient ct:!!dren. Nonetheless, the training procedures used here, perhaps in combination with a program to directly reinforce children\\'s skill use in the natural environment, can be incorporated in applied traininginterventions.    Session E\\' Introduction Goals Ii II II III III To learn about this program and what it will involve To review a model of depression To understand the role of your thoughts in your depression To discuss the effects of depression on your activity level To plan for safety ifyou are experiencing thoughts ofsuicide Overview You are about to begin a cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) program for managing bipolar disorder. This program is comprised of up to 30 sessions with a qualified mental health professional. Treatment is divided into four phases. In the first phase, sessions with your therapist will focus on depression and depressive episodes. In the second phase, you will work with your therapist to devise a Treatment Contract that states what you want to be done in the event that you are experiencing a severe episode (either depressive or manic). It is during this phase that you will choose individuals to be a part of your support system or team. The third phase will target areas such as social skills, anger management, problem solving, anxiety, relaxation, and extreme emotions. In this phase you will learn skills and strategies for decreasing your stress in order to manage depressive and manic symptoms. The final phase oftreatment focuses on relapse prevention. Model of Depression Depression is more than just the sad mood most people might experience when they have had a bad day. Major depression is a medical disorder that lasts at least 2 weeks and that produces a combination of physical and emotional symptoms that make it very difficult to function in life. Some of these symptoms may 3 include difficulty sleeping, poor concentration, low energy, and loss of appetite, as well as irritability, anger, and increased anxiety and worry. One of the goals of this program is to teach you about common patterns in depression and how to manage them. You and your therapist will be discussing emotional, cognitive (thought), and behavioral patterns that either serve you well or hurt you and your mood. The goal is to increase the patterns that help and decrease the patterns that hurt through discussion and active practice. The Role of Cognitions Cognitions are the thoughts, images, and attitudes that occur on a moment-bymoment basis. Your perceptions and cognitions help define the world for you. These cognitions do not have to be true or accurate to have a powerful effect on your emotions. Oftentimes, faulty cognitions, or what we call \"automatic thoughts,\" can lead to or help maintain depression. Throughout therapy you will be asked to examine and monitor your mood and automatic thoughts. Right now, because you are depressed, your thoughts are not helping you. You will work with your therapist to identify your negative automatic thoughts and then challenge and alter those negative thoughts to make them more useful for you. This is called cognitive restructuring, and you will learn more about this process later on in treatment. Depression and Activity Levels Depression can lead to a decrease in activity level. The feeling of not wanting to do things often keeps people away from positive events in their lives. For example, it is not uncommon for someone who is depressed to say, \"I was going to do something, but I ended up just sitting in my room, staring at the wall for an hour and a half.\" And during that time, it is common for depressed individuals to ruminate (turn negative thoughts over and over in one\\'s head), resulting in an increase in negative thoughts and feelings. In addition, because time was spent staring at the wall instead of getting out and pursuing a positive event, the depressed individual is left with no new experiences and no pleasant memories that would serve as a natural deterrent to depression. 4 This program oftreatment will encourage stepwise reengagement in pleasant and meaningful events. You should think of these events as natural buffers against feelings ofdepression. However, you do need to be prepared for some of the negative thoughts that will occur when trying to initiate these pleasant events. With depression, it is very common to have self-defeating predictions about events: \"I\\'m not going to have fun anyway. What\\'s the purpose? Why even bother?\" Thoughts like these sap the motivation for making the effort to go out. These thoughts also place too much attention on self-evaluation, so that depressed individuals may be plagued by thoughts such as: \\'\\'Am I having fun yet?\" or \"Why is it so hard to enjoy anything anymore?\" Under these conditions, you can understand that it is a challenge to reengage in pleasant events when depressed. Nonetheless, in this treatment program, you will be asked to do just that. A big part of treatment involves coming up with positive events and participating in them, while monitoring and getting a handle on the negative thoughts that come with depression. For home practice of therapy principles, you will be asked to monitor your current involvement in work and leisure activities using the WeeklyActivity Schedule at the end of the chapter. You will review the completed form with your therapist and begin devising a plan for adding more enjoyable activities and events to your life. Suicidal Thinking and Self-Care At times, symptoms of bipolar disorder may include feelings of hopelessness. During intense times when symptoms are at their worst, things may feel so hopeless that life doesn\\'t seem worth living. These feelings might also include thoughts of wanting to harm yourself or commit suicide. Suicidal thoughts can be overwhelming and frightening and may occur during both the depressive and manic phases of the disorder. The most important thing to remember about suicidal thoughts and behaviors is that they are symptoms ofyour illness and just like other symptoms of bipolar disorder they can be treated. If you are experiencing thoughts of suicide, please discuss this with your therapist right away. Your therapist will help you come up with a safety plan and may ask you to review and complete the Self-Care Worksheet for Suicidal Thoughts that appears at the end of this chapter. 5 Homework Complete the Weekly Activity Schedule at the end of the chapter as a first step toward understanding and modifying your usual activities. ~ If necessary, review and fill out the Self-Care Worksheet for Suicidal Thoughts. 6 Weekly Activity Schedule Morning Midday Afternoon Evening Monday Tuesday Wednesday -Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday 7 Self-Care Worksheet for Suicidal Thoughts I am aware that suicidal thoughts can be a symptom of depression, and this symptom needs to be managed just like any other symptom of the disorder. These thoughts may come to mind, but it is crucial that I never act on these thoughts; at every point in time, I need to keep myself safe so that I can have a chance to improve. If I do have suicidal thoughts, I have choices other than to act on these thoughts. My triggers for suicidal thoughts: I can contact the following people should I ever have strong suicidal thoughts: My psychiatrist\\'s phone number: _ My therapist\\'s phone number: _ My primary support person\\'s phone number: _ Crisis hotline or emergency room phone number: _ Other support individuals or resources: _ Things that I can do to keep myself safe when I am feeling suicidal (places I can go, things I can do, people I can see): 8 Session 2: Mood Charting andActivity Scheduling Goals To begin using a Mood Chart to track your symptoms To start incorporating pleasant activities into your daily life . To think about ways of changing your negative thinking by adapting a positive \"coaching\" attitude Mood Chart As. part of this program, you will be encouraged to keep a daily record of your mood patterns. Mood charting is recommended because it enables you to detect eatly signs of changes in your mood and communicate this information to your care providers. Mood charting can also help you and your treatment team to intervene early to prevent severe episodes. An advantage of mood charting is that you become more familiar with the patterning of your mood and your personal triggers for mood changes. For this reason, there is space on your Mood Chart to note your daily stressors. You will also be asked to track your medication doses on your Mood Chart. As you know, remembering to take medication can be difficult. Your Mood Chart can help you to keep track ofyour doses on a daily basis. You may wish to set up a system of reminders to help you remember to complete your Mood Chart. For example, you can leave reminder notes around your home in placeswhere you are most likely to see them (e.g, bathroom mirror, refrigerator, or inside your front door). You may also wish to set up prompts to help you remember to bring your completed Mood Chart to every session. Your therapist will review your Mood Chart at the beginning of every meeting. A blank Mood Chart with space to record for an entire month is provided at the end of the chapter. 9 Completing Your Mood Chart At first glance me Mood Chart can appear complicated. This is a very common reaction. However, the Mood Chart can take as little as 30 seconds a day to complete. The following directions will help you to fill out your Mood Chart. At the start of the day: 1/ Record the number of hours of sleep you got the night before At the end of the day: II Rate your mood. Indicate two ratings: one for me highest level your mood reached during the day and one for the lowest level ofyour mood during me day. If your mood did not change or fluctuate, your two ratings may be the same. Ifyour mood state was normal, you may use the abbreviation WNL, which stands for \"within normal limits.\" II Rate your anxiety. Use the following scale: No anxiety = 0, Mild anxiety = I, Moderate anxiety = 2, and Severe anxiety = 3 I!II Rate your irritability. Use me following scale: No irritability =0, Mild irritability =I, Moderate irritability =2, and Severe irritability 3 II Make notes on any stressful or positive events that occurred during the day II Record me number of tablets of each medication actually taken On a monthly basis: II Record your weight II For women, circle the dates when menstruating Activity Monitoring and Pleasant Events List For homework last week, you were asked to monitor your current level of activity using the Weekly Activity Schedule. Think about the types of activity you engaged in and me impact they had on your mood. In this session, you will learn about buffering events. Buffering events are those small activities that a person does week to week that can reliably break up the stress of the week. These activities can be almost anything-watching a favorite 10 television show, taking time to read, working on a hobby, spending time with a friend, scheduling a regular night to go out to dinner-anything that can happen with some regularity. Some people pick a time of the day or a time of the week for such an activity and then change the activity each week, depending on their interests. In the next few sessions, you will start building in more of these buffering activities. It is helpful to start thinking about some pleasurable events that you may want to add to your life. This is important for treating depression, because depression has a way of sapping motivation and sucking away pleasurable activities in a person\\'s life. The following is a list of pleasant events. Review this list and circle any activities you think you might enjoy, making darker circles around the items you think you might enjoy the most. Pleasant Events List Take daily walks for pleasure Jog (at the park, track, or gym) Rollerblade Ride a bike Swim Windsurf Go sailing Fish Ski Ice skate Playa sport (tennis, golf, volleyball, softball, soccer, etc.) Train with weights Go to a movie Have dinner with friends Take an art class Play with a pet Sit in the sun Read a book Volunteer Take up a hobby (drawing, painting, knitting, sewing, etc.) Take a cooking or baking class Talk to friends on the phone 11 Write letters Go window shopping Learn to play an instrument Learn a foreign language Do a crossword puzzle Barbeque Go to a spa Take a bubble bath Have a garage sale Plant a garden Start a collection (stamps, sea glass, sports memorabilia, etc.) Go to a concert or play Visit a museum or art gallery Take a dance class Plan a vacation Take a long drive Rent a DVD and have a movie night with friends Listen to music Wash and wax your car Clean your home Work on an arts and crafts project Organize a weekly card game (poker, bridge, cribbage, etc.) Meditate Buy flowers for your home Learn to knit or sew Play with children Coaching Story At the end of this week\\'s session, your therapist will use a metaphor to introduce you to the concept of cognitive restructuring. The purpose of the story is to illustrate how you can accurately evaluate your negative thoughts and how you can change these thoughts by \"coaching\" yourself with positive selftalk. In short, the coaching story is designed to help you \"listen in\" and see how you are talking to yourself. The aim is to help you be a useful coach to yourself, making sure that your self-talk helps you with your goals rather than hindering you. 12 Homework Begin mood charting. Review the Pleasant Events List and continue to monitor your activities using the Weekly Activity Schedule provided at the end of the chapter. Refer back to the coaching story your therapist presented to you and begin to pay attention to the way you coach yourself Practice replacing \"Coach 1\\\\\\' thoughts with \"Coach B\" thoughts instead. 13 Weekly Activity Schedule Morning Midday Afternoon Evening Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday 14 Mood Chart I $ I .ll ,. t g I .ll ~ ~ I ~ I .ll MOOD Ratewith 2 mar1<s eachdayto indicate bestandworst Depreued WNL Elev8tecl TREATMENTS (Enternumberollablets takeneach day) i!: I I .ll a-rene 1 \",mild 2 = moderate Severe Mod Mild Mild Mod Severe Month/Year 3 severe l~ i ~ ~ MOOD NOT ~ I zu> U> DEFINITELY lL\\' zu> 0\"\" <is. ,.\\'9 \" 3~\" s~ 1 Daily Notes ~~ ~a ELEVATEDOR \"l i U> ~ ~I 3~ DEPRESSED ~~ ~~ \" j- h .... ~ Ii; ! \"~ o~ .... 3 3 ~..g> ~l 03\" ~f ~ ~~. ~i NO SYMPTOMS ,,\"- ~r l~ ~l I I I ~I \". ~ \"~ n h .ll .ll ~ Circledate 10indicate Men... ~. 1 2 3 5 6 7 9 10 11 12 13 ,. 15 16 17 ts 19 20 21 22 23 2\\' 25 26 27 2. 29 30 31 Weight 15  Session 3: Cognitive Restructuring-Part I Goals III To learn to identify common thinking errors III To begin monitoring your thoughts Identifying Cognitive Errors This week, you will learn about common thinking errors and how to increase your awareness and ability to recognize these types of thoughts. As previously mentioned, this process is called cognitive restructuring. Following is a list of typical thinking styles that can contribute to depression and depressive thoughts. Familiarizing yourselfwith this list is an important first step in identifying the connections between your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. The following are adapted from (Burns, D. 1999. Feeling Good: The new mood therapy. New York: Harper Collins.) All-or-Nothing Thinking (Black-and-White Thinking) You think in black and white terms; there are no gray areas. This type ofthinking is unrealistic because things are seldom all or nothing, good or bad. Overgeneralization You assume that a one-time negative occurrence will happen again and again. You use words like \"always\" or \"never\" to make generalizations. Mental Filter You focus exclusively on negative details and ignore anything positive. Since you are filtering out the positives, you see the entire situation as negative. 17 Disqualifying the Positive You turn positives into negatives by insisting they \"don\\'t count.\" This allows you to maintain your negative outlook despite positive experiences. Jumping to Conclusions In the absence of solid evidence, you jump to a negative conclusion. There are two types of this: \"mind reading\" and the \"fortune teller error.\" Mind Reading You assume that you know what someone else is thinking. You are so convinced that the person is having a negative reaction to you, you don\\'t even take the time to confirm your guess. The Fortune Teller Error You act as a fortune teller who only predicts the worst for you. You then treat your unrealistic prediction as if it were a proven fact. Magnification (Catastrophizing) or Minimization You magnify negative things, blowing their importance out of proportion. The outcome of an event appears catastrophic to you. You minimize positive things, shrinking down their significance. You make good experiences out to be smaller than they are. Emotional Reasoning You take your emotions as proof of the way things really are. You assume something is true because you feel it is. \"Should\" Statements You build your expectations with \"shoulds,\" \"musts,\" and \"oughts.\" When you don\\'t follow through, you feel guilty. When others disappoint you, you feel angry and resentful. 18 Labeling and Mislalbeling You label yourself or someone else, rather than just identifying the behavior. You mislabel an event by using inaccurate and emotionally extreme language. Personalization You take responsibility for things that you don\\'t have control over. You feel guilty because you assume a negative event is your fault. Self-Monitoring and the Thought Record As mentioned last week, you will now begin to learn more about cognitive restructuring. Starting today, you will begin to monitor your thoughts using the Thought Record provided at the end of this chapter. This form will help you recognize, evaluate, and modify your automatic negative thoughts, with the goal of improving your mood. To avoid being needlessly pushed around by inaccurate thoughts, it is important to treat your thoughts as guesses about the world. Before accepting a thought as true, it is important to evaluate the thought to see whether it is truly helpful to you. Whenever you experience a negative thought, you should immediately examine the evidence for and against it. After evaluating the evidence, you should try to come up with an alternative thought that is more realistic. The Thought Record can help you do this. The Thought Record consists of multiple columns used to separately document the following: .. The event or situation that triggered the automatic thoughtts) .. The emotions or feelings associated with the particular event or situation .. The content of the automatic thoughtfs) and how strongly you believe it .. The accuracy of the automatic rhoughtts) .. The strength ofyour emotions and belief in the automatic thoughtts) after evaluating the evidence for and against the thought{s) Figure j.r shows an example of a partially completed Thought Record.

This week you will learn to evaluate these thoughts. Once you are able to identify thoughts that are related to feelingsofdepression, then you can question the accuracy ofthese thoughts. Review with your therapist the thoughts you recorded on the Thought Record and look for common themes. Your goal is to discover how depression distorts your thoughts and to systematically challenge these thoughts so that they no longer have an effect on your mood. For each thought, ask yourself the following: II \"What evidence do I have that this thought is true?\" III \"What evidence do I have against this thought?\" Write down your answers to these questions on the Thought Record in the column marked \"Evaluation of Automatic Thought.\" Your therapist will help you practice this step of the process until you feel comfortable doing it on your own.

Figure 4.1 continued Activity Planning The previous session focused on pleasant activities that help buffer stress. This session will focus on adding mastery activities to your schedule. Mastery activities are those that are responsibility based; those things that need to get done, such as doing the laundry, going grocery shopping, and tidying up your home. Activity scheduling is an important strategy that can be used to enhance your mood. When you are depressed, you may be more likely to stay in bed and less likely to engage in a regular schedule of activities. This restriction of activity is likely to contribute to you feeling even more depressed. The goal of activity scheduling is to devise a plan that allows a gradual reintroduction of regular activity, including both responsibility-based and fun activities. Work with your therapist to generate ideas for both pleasant and mastery activities that you can add to your life. Record your ideas in the space provided. 25 My Activities List Pleasant Mastery Homework Continue using the Thought Record to monitor thoughts and feelings on a daily basis. You may now begin completing the evaluation column to challenge negative thinking. ~ Continue adding pleasurable and mastery activities to the My Activities List. ~ Continue monitoring your daily activities using the Weekly Activity Schedule provided at the end of this chapter. 26 ThoUght Record Situation (Describe the event that led to the unpleasant emotion) Emotion (Specifysad, angry, etc., and rate the emotion from 0% to 100%) Automatic thought (Write the automatic thought and rate your belief in the thought from 0% to 100%) Evaluation of automatic thought (Evaluate the accuracy of the automatic thought) Re-rate emotion (Re-rate the emotion and your belief in the thought from 0% to 100%) ! 27 Weekly Activity Schedule Morning Midday Afternoon Evening Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday 28 Sessions 5 and 6: Cognitive Restructuring-Part III Goals II To continue cognitive restructuring by learning to generate more accurate and realistic thoughts II To make a plan for incorporating both pleasure- and responsibility-based activities into your life Generating Alternative Responses Now that you have had practice identifying and evaluating your negative thoughts, it is time to focus on generating alternative thoughts that are more accurate and realistic. For example, if you have the thought, \"I am not good at anything 1 do,\" and you are able to come up with evidence against this thought, then a reasonable alternative response may be, \"There are some things that 1don\\'t do well, but there are many things that I\\'m very good at doing.\" Review your previous week\\'s Thought Records with your therapist and come up with some alternative thoughts or interpretations to the negative thoughts you listed. You are encouraged to continue monitoring your thoughts and completing Thought Records for the next several weeks. The more practice you get now, the easier it will be for you to incorporate a new style of thinking into your daily life. After some additional practice, you can fade out the use of the actual recording form. At that point, you should be comfortable going through the steps of cognitive restructuring in your mind when you sense a change in your mood state. Planning Activities Last week you were asked to come up with ideas of pleasurable and mastery activities that you would like to begin incorporating into your life. This week you will begin engaging in these pleasurable activities. 29 Use the blank Weekly Activity Schedule at the end of this chapter to begin planning your activities for the week. Discuss with your therapist the details of your plan (when, where, and how you will carry out each activity). The ongoing use of a Weekly Activity Schedule for monitoring and planning daily activities is recommended. Information on the Weekly Activity Schedule (e.g., decreased level of involvement) can serve as an indicator that a more severe depression may be imminent. It can also serve as a device for planning and following through with scheduled events. You are encouraged to complete the Weekly Activity Schedule every evening for the next several weeks. Homework Participate in at least two planned activities this week (one mastery and one pleasurable) and complete the Weeldy Activity Schedule at the end of this chapter.

Many of these beliefs emerge early in life, when we are vulnerable, unsure of ourselves, and just learning about how to navigate life demands and interpersonal relationships. These beliefsalso tend to be formed at times ofchange or crisis, and once formed, these beliefscan become fixed. This means that a belief created when we are young may be applied over and over again across the years, even though the belief is not accurate. These beliefs about ourselves and the world are called core beliefS. Core beliefs are often the underlying themes to a range of automatic and dysfunctional thoughts. Identifying Core Beliefs There are two strategies to help you with the identification of your core beliefs: top down and bottom up. The bottom-up strategy is to try to infer your core beliefs by examining your responses to early life events. The top-down strategy is to identify themes from your current automatic thoughts. Common themes to automatic thoughts include core beliefs such as \"I\\'m unlovable\" or \"1 am incompetent,\" These types of negative beliefs may be dormant during times when you are feeling well and activated when you get depressed. When depressed, your core belief may act as a filter. For example, all of the information that supports the negative belief may readily filter through to your daily thoughts, and evidence contradicting the negative belief may be ignored or discounted. These types of negative beliefs can contribute to getting depressed, particularly when negative events happen that relate to your core beliefs. These core beliefs can also be powerful in leading you to avoid or terminate otherwise useful or 33 pleasant situations (e.g., rejecting others before they reject you, leaving a social or work situation). To start to identify your core beliefs, use the Investigating Underlying Beliefs Worksheet. This form helps you ask questions about automatic thoughts to try to find underlying beliefs. Asyou write out your automatic thought (use one that is recent, or transfer over a negative automatic thought from one of your recent Thought Records). Then, ask yourself questions about these thoughts to try to identify the beliefs and assumptions about yourself or your performance that may underlie these thoughts. Write in these responses, then investigate further, again asking yourself about assumptions and beliefs that underlie these deeper thoughts. These potential core beliefs should be discussed with your therapist in your next session. 34 Investigating Underlying Beliefs Worksheet Automatic thought linked to negative emotion (from Thought Record) Investigate the theme behind this thought by answering the following questions: What is the meaning of this thought? Why does this thought bother me?What would be so bad if this thought were true? Further investigate underlying beliefs by answering the following questions: What is the meaning of this thought? Why does this thought bother me? What would be so bad if this thought were true? What core belief might this reflect? 35 Homework Continue monitoring your automatic thoughts using the Thought Record and examine these thoughts further to determine underlying core beliefs (see appendix for additional copies of Thought Record, if needed). ~ If not done in session, complete the Investigating Underlying Beliefs Worksheet. ~ Continue monitoring your daily activities using the Weekly Activity Schedule at the end of the chapter (see appendix for additional copies, if needed). 36 Thought Record Emotion Automatic thought Evaluation of Re-rate emotion Situation automatic thought {Describe the (Specifysad, {Write the automatic {Evaluate the (Re-rate the emotion thought and rate your accuracy of the and your belief in belief in the thought event that led to angry, etc., and the unpleasant rate the emotion automatic the thought from from 0% to 100%} thought} 0% to 100%} 100%) emotion} from 0% to .._~ _. ...37 Weekly Activity Schedule Morning Midday Afternoon Evening Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday .........._. Friday Saturday m._~~ Sunday 38 Session 8: Challenging Core Beliefi Goals II To learn strategies for challenging your core beliefs Further Understanding Core Beliefs In the previous session, you used the Investigating Underlying Beliefs Worksheet to begin to identify underlying thoughts that may contribute to your core beliefs. In this session, you will further examine the link between negative and automatic thoughts and the core beliefs they reflect. On the Core Belief Worksheet on page 42, please copy over from your recent Thought Records any recurrent thoughts that you notice. Then, see if you can identify the \"theme\" behind these thoughts. Also, take some time to think about some of your early memories of times of change or crisis, especially situations where you felt badly. Then try to recall what you came to believe at that time, particularly beliefs about yourself The next step is to use this information to try to identify core beliefs that are active during your depression. Write these beliefs and any core strategies (such as avoidance patterns) into the boxes in the middle of the worksheet. Core strategies represent those habits that you used to try to avoid, eliminate, or otherwise cope with core beliefs. Remember that just because you have lots ofhabits to cope with core beliefs, these habits don\\'t mean your beliefs are true. Challenging Core Beliefs When people are depressed, they have a tendency to view their beliefs as facts. Furthermore, they tend to look for support to back up these faulty beliefs.Youcan challenge core beliefs in much the same way you have been taught to challenge your automatic thoughts. Just as you have been evaluating the evidence for and against your negative thoughts, you will now begin generating evidence contrary to your core beliefs. 39 Finding Intermediate Beliefs In restructuring core beliefs, often it is important to find intermediate beliefs that you are willing to accept. For example, if you have the core belief that \"I am completely inadequate,\" it is unlikely that you will go from feeling that way to feeling that you are completely adequate. An intermediate step may be formulating the belief that \"I am reasonably adequate at many things.\" Think about your core beliefs and try to find the middle ground. Core Beliefs and Childhood Experiences A crucial part of understanding and modifying core beliefs may involve identifying the developmental and historical precursors of your core beliefs. Choose one ofyour core beliefs and ask yourself the following questions: l1li When did I first feel this way? l1li Were there any times in my childhood when I felt this way? As children, we tend to believe what we are told. In a way, children are like sponges, they absorb what is given to them by their environment. This type of learning can occur in the context of direct messages received from authority figures (parents, teachers, etc.) or from peers. However, sometimes this type of learning occurs more subtly. Sometimes negative messages are given to children unfairly, and they come to believe them as truths. For this reason, it is important for you to explore how you developed certain beliefs about yourself Then, you can test these beliefs to see if they are fair or realistic now that you are an adult. The following case example illustrates the importance of examining the historical context of core beliefs. Case Example Mr. j. had always heldthe beliefthat he was inferior and incompetent, particularly in areas related to school and work achievement. Theyoungest of three brothers, he had relative difficulty in school and was often compared to his older brothers byhisparents. He recalls havingdifficulty in math skills and feeling humiliatedbythis inadequacy. While heperformed relatively wellin high school and graduatedfrom a state college, hestillfelt like a relative failure in contrast to his two older brothers, who graduatedfrom Ivy League schools and 40 pursuedlaw school like theirfitther. Mr. j. pelOrmedwellin hisjob selling life insurance and was wellliked byhis boss and coworkers. However, when he became depressed, his core beliefi ofinadequacy tendedto resurface, leaving him doubtfulabouthisabilities and discouraged abouthisfinancialsituation. Although, he was happily marriedand owneda homein apleasant, middle-class neighborhood, he wouldbegin to compare himselfto his brothers, who were wealthier and held more prestigious positions in lawfirms. When depressed, he wouldalso doubthisabilities at work, withdrawingfrom sales meetings and reducing his clientcontact. Paradoxically, such behaviors resulted in lower sales figures for the month, further confirming his core beliefi ofinadequacy. An intervention used with Mr. j. involved his viewofhisownson who was currently in 4th grade (around thesame age asMr. j. was whenhe developed his core beliefofinadequacy). When questionedabouthowhe wouldtreat hisson if he had difficulties in school he began to realizefor thefirst time that he had been treated unfitirly. He began to realize that he had skills that his older brothers did not have. However, hisparents did notpraise those skills and talents (sports, good social skills, etc). Mr. j. began to recognize and evaluate howhis core beliefi stillpushedhim aroundtoday. He learned to value some ofhis talents and tojudgehimselfagainst hisownstandards. 41 Core Belief Worksheet Situation: Thought: Feeling: Theme behind this thought: Situation: Thought: Feeling: Theme behind this thought: Age: Situation: Belief Formed From This Event Strategy for Dealing With The Event fP\\';te~;;\\'C~;:B~ii:f;- - ...~ ,n n u.. -\\'1 Ic.;,-~;__\\'r 1 [ ,_.._, .._,_1 Age: Situation: Belief Formed From This Event Strategy for Dealing With The Event Age: Situation: Belief Formed From This Event Strategy for Dealing With The Event Source: Form based on strategies in Beck, J.

You will discuss how these situations may be related to your core beliefs. The triggers for a depressive episode may differ depending on the nature ofyour core beliefs. If you place great value on being accepted and loved by others, you may be devastated by losses or rejections, such as the breakup of a romantic relationship or a fight with a close friend or a family member. Ifyou place the greatest value on a need for independence or freedom from control, setbacks at work or criticisms of your abilities may trigger an episode. Let\\'s return to the case example of Mr. J to illustrate this point. Case Example Treatment for Mr. J was about modifYing his core beliefs ofinadequacy and helping him target those specific behaviors that served to confirm his core beliefs (e.g., avoiding workresponsibilities when depressed). For example, Mr. J and his therapist targeted specific ways for him to stay on track with clients when feeling depressed. While Mr. J was usually highly motivated topursue meetings with clients, heand his therapist acknowledged his tendency to withdrawfrom clients when depressed. In addition to challenging interfering negative thoughts, heset up a system in which he tracked his numberofsales calls per dayand discussed this each week during therapy. In this way, he was ableto keep his core beliefs from becoming a self-fulfillingprophecy. 47 My Triggers Use the space provided to note three typical situations that are likely to trigger negative thoughts related to your core beliefs. I. _ 2. _ 3 _ Together with your therapist, you will problem solve alternative cognitive and behavioral responses to these situations. Readjusting Expectations This week you will also discuss how your disorder has disrupted your life goals and daily plans. Episodes of mania can be responsible for dramatic disruptions such as missing a semester of school, losing a job, or ending a relationship. Episodes of depression can lead to a loss of motivation, the development of poor work habits, and a disruption in the setting and achieving of goals. During periods of stability, individuals with bipolar disorder may think they need to \"catch up\" or that they are \"falling behind\" in their lives. It is important to recognize, however, that trying to make up for lost time only increases anxiety, tension, and stress. This is why you should readjust your personal expectations. Discuss with your therapist the steps you can take toward achieving your goals and complete the Long-Term Goal Sheet. 48 Long-Term Goal Sheet Long-term goal: Short-termgoal: Skill neededto achieve this goal: Short-termgoal: Skill neededto achieve this goal: Short-termgoal: Skill neededto achieve this goal: Short-termgoal: Skill neededto achieve this goal: Short-termgoal: Skill neededto achieve this goal: NOWYour currentsituation: 49 Homework Continue to monitor and challenge core beliefs, and explore intermediate beliefs using the Thought Record and, as needed, the Core Belief Worksheet from Chapter 7 (see appendix for additional copies of the Thought Record, if needed). ~ Continue scheduling and monitoring activities using the Weekly Activity Schedule at the end of the chapter (seeappendix for additional copies, if needed). 50 Ihought Record Situation (Describe the event that led to the unpleasant emotion) Emotion (Specifysad, angry, etc., and rate the emotion from 0% to 100%) Automatic thought (Write the automatic thought and rate your belief in the thought from 0% to 100%) Evaluation of automatic thought (Evaluate the accuracy ofthe automatic thought) Re-rate emotion (Re-rate the emotion and your belief in the thought from 0% to 100%) 51 Weekly Activity Schedule Morning Midday Afternoon Evening Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday 52   Sessions IO-I2: Drafting a Treatment Contract Goals III To select members ofyour support system and draft a Treatment Contract When to Contract A Treatment Contract is an important element of treatment that can be initiated at any phase, but is typically put into place when individuals are oriented toward relapse prevention. The Treatment Contract makes use ofyour knowledge about your disorder-the type of symptoms that emerge during the initial stages of mood episodes-to help you put into place protective behaviors. Moreover, by working on the Treatment Contract with both your clinician and your valued family members, you are able to make sure others work with you on your relapseprevention goals. Treatment Contract A Treatment Contract provides you with an opportunity to plan in advance what you want to happen when you are ill. Designing this plan when you are well allows you to specify which management strategies you prefer to use for coping with severe episodes. Before drafting the contract, you should select individuals to be a part of your support system. You may wish to include your medical doctorfs), your therapist, friends, family members, coworkers, etc. Your support system will participate with you on your Treatment Contract. Use the space provided to list the individuals you\\'d like to ask to be a part ofyour support system. It is important that your support system receive information about bipolar disorder. Advise them to obtain a copy of Living with Bipolar Disorder: A Guide fir Individuals and Families (Otto et al., 2008, Oxford University Press) and have 55 them read this workbook. You may also invite your support system to attend upcoming meetings with your therapist. My Support System Drafting aTreatment Contract After identifying your support system, you will specify thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and early warning signs for your episodes of depression. Then, you can map out a plan for coping with depression, identifying the ways your support team can help you. You will also note the thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and early warning signs of episodes of hypomania and/or mania. Then, you will map out a plan for coping with these types of episodes, giving specific instructions to your support system. An upcoming session will focus on manic episodes so you may wish to wait until then to devise a plan for dealing with those episodes. The sample contract at the end of the chapter can be used as a model for developing your own treatment plan. Homework Review and complete the sample Treatment Contract at the end of the chapter. Feel free to personalize the contract and make revisions. Remember, you may wish to hold off on completing the sections related to hypomanic or manic episodes until after you discuss them with your therapist. 56 ~ If not done in session, think about who you wish to invite to be a member of your support system. ~ Ifprepared to do so, invite members ofyour support network to attend upcoming meetings with your therapist. ~ Prepare for the upcoming discussion of mania by reflecting on past episodes of mania and the changes in thoughts, feelings, and behaviors that you experienced. ~ Continue to complete Thought Records and the Weekly Activity Schedule as advised by your therapist. (See appendix for additional copies of forms.) 57 Treatment Contract The purpose of rhis contract is to organize my care for bipolar disorder, with attention to both the prevention of mood episodes and rhe efficient treatment of these episodes should rhey occur. My first step in guiding my care is the selection of my support team. The team members should include people wirh whom I have regular contact, who can help me identify episodes should rhey occur and help me put into practice some of the tools discussed in earlier chapters of this workbook. (Select members of your treatment team to be part of your crew; for example, you may select your psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker, or primary care physician. Other team members may be drawn from the support network identified in Chapter 9.) 1\\'edtnlf~rd Cr) lI t l rl Ct Slq\"\\'lPCLI!

This week\\'s session will cover the detection and prevention of manic episodes. Think about any of your previous manic or hypomanic episodes. Did you notice that your thinking was hyperpositive during those times? The following is a list of typical cognitive errors characteristic of hypomania. Review the list and identify any thoughts you have experienced. Positive Fortune-Telling-Being overly optimistic about unknown outcomes Overreliance on luck-e.g., \"I can get away with it.\" Underestimating risk or danger-e.g., \"It will work out one way or another.\" Overly positive appraisal of one\\'s talents and abilities-e.g., \"I can do no wrong.\" Disqualifying the negative/Minimizing problems/Not thinking through the negative consequences-e.g., \"I don\\'t have a care in the world.\" Overvaluing of immediate gratification-e.g., \"I want what I want when I want it.\" Suspiciousness or paranoia-e.g., \"Everyone is looking at me.\" Misinterpreting the intentions ofothers-s-e.g., seeing sexual content or innuendo where there is none (\"He/she wants me.\") or seeing slights or aggressive content where there is none (\"They\\'re out to get me.\") 63 .. Inappropriate use of humore.g., \"They think I\\'m funny.\" l1li Seeing special connections or heightened religious significance Challenging Hyperpositive Thinking The same techniques can be used to examine hyperpositive thinking as are used to challenge your automatic negative thoughts. You may use the Thought Record in the same way. Figure 10.1 shows a completed example of a Thought Record used to examine hyperpositive thinking errors.

Figure 10.1 continued Minimizing the Impact of Hypomania and Mania Now that you understand how to identify and examine your hyperpositive thoughts, you can begin implementing strategiesfor preventing episodes ofmania that may follow these thoughts. A primary strategy is talking with your therapist and your psychopharmacologist to consider whether a medication change may be helpful in ensuring that hypomanic symptoms do not escalate into full mama. 65 Another important strategy is in considering how you can ensure that temporary hypomanic or manic symptoms do not lead to longstanding regret. With hypomania and mania a wide range of risky behaviors-financial decisions, investments, romantic liaisons, sexual behavior, substance use, or interpersonal confrontations-mayfie! appropriate due to the expansive mood of mania. Part of managing hypomania is to avoid making impulsive decisions and to avoid trusting the overpositive mood and thinking that is at the core ofhypomania and mania. Even though a decision may fie! right, it may not be right in mania. This is crucial to remember, because arguments with family members or employers, financial blunders, sexual affairs, or substance abuse all have consequences that greatly outlast the hypomanic or manic episode. To help combat this potential for negative outcomes, it is helpful to follow the following principles for action when hypomanic symptoms are present. Some of these principles are already included in the Treatment Contract, but you may want to include additional rules to help protect yourself from negative consequences from hypomania and mama. During hypomanic or manic episodes, it is important to: II Avoid major financial decisions such as new purchases or major investments. This is done to protect your financial security, so that your long-term financial health is not challenged by the consequences of overconfidence from mania. If you feel like you must make a decision when you are feeling positive or high, it is best to check with at least two valued advisors to help you decide whether the decision is sound. This is called the Two-Person Feedback Rule. Because a hypomanic mood may lead you to believe that you are thinking faster and better than those around you, it is crucial that you do not discount the advice from these valued advisors. II Avoid alcohol and drug use when hypomanic. When hypomanic, you may feel like you can handle alcohol or drug use; it is crucial at these times to know that your judgment is impaired by the mood episode. No good can come from mixing alcohol and drug use with hypomania. III Avoid relationship decisions. When hypomanic, don\\'t give out your phone number, ask out new people, or engage in sexual behavior with new partners. III Avoid confrontations. Hypomania and mania often bring irritability. When irritability is high, it may well be worth protecting your job or your relationships by taking a day offwork or agreeing with you family members to not have major discussions (\"I am really irritable these days from my 66 mood, let\\'s put off any major discussions until I feel better. And if I seem especially caught up on minor issues, know that these issues may be much more manageable for me when my mood normalizes.\"). Avoid using a credit card when hypomanic. When mood episodes strike, you may want to turn over any credit cards with high spending limits to a valued other so that you cannot create substantial debt for yourself during the episode. Homework If not completed, finalize your Treatment Contract, with attention to the type of thinking and activity patterns that characterize the emergence of hypomanic or manic episodes. ~ Use the Thought Record to monitor your hyperpositive thinking, as well as your negative automatic thoughts. ~ Continue scheduling and monitoring activities using the Weekly Activity Schedule (see appendix for additional copies of the form). 67 Thought Record Situation Re-rare emotion automatic thought (Describe the Emotion Automatic thought Evaluation of (Re-rate the emotion event that led to (Specifysad, (Write the automatic (Evaluate the accuracy of the and your belief in the unpleasant angry, etc., and thought and rate your the thought from emotion) rate the emotion belief in the thought automatic 0% to 100%) 100%) from 0% to from 0% to 100%) thought) !68 Weekly Activity Schedule Morning Midday I Afternoon Evening _ ..

From now on, session content will be individualized and tailored to fit your specific needs. The next four chapters represent some of the topics your therapist may address with you during this stage of treatment. Introduction to Problem Solving The first topic is problem solving. You may have noticed that when you are depressed you have a hard time resolving certain issues or problems. This is because depression makes it hard to view situations accurately and realistically. Problem solving teaches you how to evaluate and solve problems more efficiently by considering numerous alternative solutions. Problem solving considers all solutions as viable until they are evaluated more closely. Scheduling aTime for Solving Problems To help keep worry out of your life, establish one or two specific times in your weekly schedule for dealing with life issues. By focusing on life issues as a regular part of the week, you will help ensure that life\\'s problems do not become overwhelming. Try to devote at least one hour every week to evaluating your life issues using the Problem-Solving Worksheet and the method described in the following section. Make note of your problem-solving schedule in the space provided. 73 My Problem-Solving Schedule My regular problem-solving times will be: __(time) on (day of the week) and / or __(time) on (day of the week) Steps to Problem Solving Components of a traditional problem solving approach include the following: 1. Identifying the problem 2. Clearly defining the problem (what about the situation makes it bothersome?) 3. Brainstorming a list of all possible solutions, even those that may seem silly or impossible 4. Evaluating the solutions (advantages and disadvantages of each) 5. Selecting a solution or combination of solutions (taking into account the benefits and liabilities of each solution) 6. Implementing the solution 7. Evaluating the effectiveness of the solution This method does not guarantee that you will come up with a good solution, but it will ensure that you think about problems more effectively and take the time to examine the best solutions you can think of on any given day. To guide you in this process, review the sample, completed Problem-Solving Worksheet shown in Figure ILL A blank copy of the sheet for your own use is also provided. Use the worksheet at your scheduled problem-solving times to evaluate difficult life situations and generate possible solutions. Additional copies of the sheet can be found in the appendix at the end of the book. 74 Problem-Solving Worksheet What is the problem: Why does this problem bother me (what are the specific features that bother me)? I want a ~He-r- ~e-n~e- of um-tYoI ove-r- ow fnanc..o.;, I fu-I like- I\\'m the- on/~ one- who r-e-a\"~ c..ar-~ what haprn~ with ovr- mon~, Is this a realisticproblem (e.g., what do I really think is going to happen, and what part ofthis problem do I think is just worry)?

The goal of this part of treatment is to help you improve your social skills. For some people, this will be a chance to hone skills with which they never felt fully comfortable. For other individuals, this will be an opportunity to learn to undo limitations in social skills that may have grown out of periods of depression. There are two kinds of skills your therapist may work with you on. The first are general social skills, which include things like smiling, laughing, and making eye contact. General social skills refer to both verbal and nonverbal methods of communicating. The second skill you will work on is assertiveness. Hierarchy of Social Situations The first step in improving your social skills is to work with your therapist to create a hierarchy of social situations that may be hard for you. Examples include saying hello to a stranger, starting a conversation with a coworker, or going to a party alone. Think about the social situations that you have experienced in the past and use these to help you create your hierarchy. Use the form provided, and list the situations in order of difficulty. Use a scale of 0-100 to rate each item, where 0 represents no difficulty and 100 represents the most difficulty. Your therapist will engage you in role-play exercises where you imagine yourself in one of the scenarios from your hierarchy. Eventually, you will be asked to participate in some of these situations in real life so you can practice what you have learned in treatment. 19 Hierarchy of Social Situations Situation Level of Difficulty (0-100) General Social Skills Training One of the most valuable social skills you can learn is effective listening. Effective listening refers to the skill of making sure that you accurately hear the speaker\\'s message and accurately communicate to the speaker that you heard it. To be an effective listener it is important to try to understand what the speaker is actually saying. The following steps are essential to effective listening: .. Give the speaker clear signs that you are listening to what he or she is saying. Look the speaker in the eye and nod as you hear each point. III Ask questions to clarify individual points. Your goal is to understand the speaker\\'s perspective. .. VerifY that you have heard the speaker\\'s issues correctly by repeating the core content to the speaker. .. Once you and the speaker agree on the message, then it is your turn to respond. 80 Assertiveness Tra,ining Before you can learn to be assertive, you need to understand the difference between assertive, aggressive, and passive behaviors. Nonassertive behaviors increase stress levels and feelings offrustration. Being passive can cause a build-up of resentment, which can negatively impact your relationships. Being aggressive may increase conflict with others, as well as feelings of shame, guilt, or regret. Passivity can be defined as a way of behaving whereby we pay a great deal of attention to others\\' needs, rights, and wishes, but minimize or ignore our own. Aggressiveness refers to a pattern of behavior where we demand that our own wishes, needs, and rights be considered while paying little attention to the needs of others. In contrast, assertiveness is a way of behaving that respects everyone\\'s wishes, needs, and rights. Review the following scenarios and work with your therapist to come up with passive, aggressive, and assertive responses to each one. III Someone asks you for a ride home and it is inconvenient for you because you have several errands to run and the drive will take you out ofyour way. What can you say? III You would like to ask your boss for a raise. What do you say? III A pushy salesperson is trying to convince you to buy a stereo that is significantly more expensive than what you had planned to spend. How do you respond? III You\\'ve been waiting for 20 min in line at the bank. Suddenly, someone cuts in front ofyou. What do you say? III The phone rings as you are preparing dinner-it\\'s a good friend ofyours. How can you handle the situation? III Your friend asks to borrow money for the second time this month-you have some extra money that you\\'ve been putting aside to buy something that you\\'ve wanted for a long time. What do you tell him? Effective assertiveness communication requires two basic skills. First, you must be able to take a step back from the situation and reflect on the course of action to be taken. Second, you must respond to situational demands in an 81 assertive manner. The first step can be broken down into the following series of behaviors: III Decreasing emotional arousal-taking a step back from the situation to calm down; going for a walk; doing a brief relaxation exercise such as deep breathing. III Clarifying the nature of the problem. Examining your own feelings and thoughts about the situation. III Identifying any distorted patterns of thinking that may be impacting your ability to behave effectively in the situation. Challenging negative, unrealistic, or judgmental thinking patterns. .. Deciding on which behaviorts) may be appropriate. For example, letting go of the situation versus expressing your feelings to the other person involved. The second step of assertiveness training focuses on communication skills. Assertive communication entails: .. Describing the situation to the other person. Reporting the facts as objectively as possible, attempting not to mix in feelings. The reporting should be situation-specific and refer to the current problem at-hand, rather than bringing up a series of past difficulties. .. Expressing feelings about the situation using \"I\" statements, as opposed to \"You.\" For example, saying, \"I feel upset when ... \"versus, \"You messed up when ... \" By taking responsibility for your feelings, you are more likely to get a positive, nondefensive reaction from others. .. Asking for what you want in a straightforward, specific manner. .. Explaining how the suggested change will be beneficial to everyone involved. Making a positive statement about the other person. 82 Breathing and Relaxation Introduction to Breathing and Relaxation Skills Breathing and relaxation skills are helpful methods for managing anxiety and stress. Once learned, these skills can be useful if applied whenever you feel anxious, angry, irritable, or frustrated. Diaphragmatic Breathing To learn how to breathe in a calming manner, sit with one hand on your chest and the other hand on your abdomen, just above your navel. As you breathe, notice the rise and fall of your hands. During proper diaphragmatic breathing, your abdomen (not your chest) should expand as you breathe in and contract as you breathe out. Perfecting this technique takes practice, so we have provided the following instructions to guide you. Step I: Rest comfortably in a chair Step 2: Place one hand on your chest and the other just below your rib cage Step 3: Breathe in slowly through your nose so that your stomach expands outward. The hand on your chest should remain still. Step 4: Breathe out through your mouth so that your stomach contracts. The hand on your chest should remain still. You may find that it is easier to practice this method while lying down. As you gain more practice, you can try the technique while sitting in a chair. During your first few exercises, you may feel mildly lightheaded. To combat this feeling, you may want to time your breaths. For example, you can count from I to 3 as you breathe in and then count from I to 5 as you breathe out. Alternatively, you can use the word \"relax\" to time your breathing. You can softly say to yourself the word \"relax\" as your breathe (\"Reee\" on the inhale and \"laaaax\\' on the exhale). 83 Practice makes perfect, so be sure to engage in breathing exercises at least twice a day for 5 min at a time. Progressive Muscle Relaxation Progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) is a useful skill for reducing tension and stress and promoting a sense of well-being. PMR is about utilizing repeated tension (10 seconds) and relaxation (20 seconds) procedures for a selected set of muscle groups. Following are instructions for practicing an 8-muscle PMR exercise. a-Muscle PMR I) Arms Muscle Group Slowly draw both hands into fists. Pull your fists into your chest and hold for 10 seconds, squeezing as tight as you can. Then, slowly release while you count for 20 seconds. Notice the feeling of relaxation. 2) Legs Muscle Group Slowly increase the tension in your quadriceps and calves over 10 seconds by lifting your legs slightly off the floor and pointing your feet inward. Squeeze the muscles as hard as you can. Then, gently lower your legs and relax your feet, releasing the tension over 20 seconds. Notice the tension melting away and the feeling of relaxation that is left. 3) Stomach Muscle Group Make your stomach hard by pulling your stomach in toward your spine very tightly. Feel the tightness of your stomach muscles. Focus on that part of your body, and hold the tension for 10 seconds. Then, let your stomach relax outwards over 20 seconds. 4) Chest Muscle Group Take a deep breath and hold it for 10 seconds. Then, let the air escape and breathe normally for 20 seconds, letting the air flow in and out smoothly and easily. Feel the difference as the muscles relax. 84 5) Shoulders and Upper Back Muscle Group Pull your shoulder blades back and together. Feel the tension around your shoulders and radiating down into your back. Hold for 10 seconds. Relax your shoulder blades over 20 seconds and let them return to a normal position. Focus on the sense of relaxation around your shoulders and across your upper back. 6) Neck Muscle Group Build up the tension around your neck by pulling your chin down toward your chest and raising and tightening your shoulders. Focus on the tension and hold for IO seconds. Then, release the tension over 20 seconds, letting your head rest comfortably and your shoulders droop. Concentrate on the relaxation. 7) Mouth, Jaw, and Throat Muscle Group Tense the muscles around your mouth, jaw, and throat by clenching your teeth and forcing the corners of your mouth into a forced smile. Hold for 10 seconds. Then, release the tension over 20 seconds, letting your mouth drop open and the muscles around your throat and jaw relax. Concentrate on the difference in the sensations in that part ofyour body. 8) Eyes and Forehead Muscle Group Squeeze your eyes tightly shut while pulling your eyebrows down and toward the center. Feel the tension across your lower forehead and around the eyes. Concentrate on the tension and hold for IO seconds. Then, release the tension over 20 seconds. Relax the forehead, smoothing out the wrinkles. 85  Anger Management Introduction to Anger Management Anger and irritability are relatively common elements of both depressed and (hypo)manic mood states. The goal of this part of treatment is to help you manage anger and confrontational behaviors more effectively. To achieve this goal, your therapist will teach you several skills for handling the emergence as well as the escalation of anger. The following principles are designed to help you reduce irritability and episodes of anger. 1. Don\\'t let poor thinking habits goad you into an angry outburst or argument. 2. Just because you are irritated, does not mean you have to solve the issue right away. 3. Beware ofwin or lose thinking (thinking that you have to act now to avoid losing). 4. Remember to value your life goals, even when you\\'re angry. The sections that follow provide information on putting these principles to use. Poor Thinking Habits and Anger When you are feeling irritated, it is important to be able to quickly evaluate and defuse the thoughts you are having that can turn small annoyances into fullblown anger episodes. There are two types of anger-related thoughts to watch out for. The first type ofthought serves to bring past annoyances and frustrations into the present, so that any minor annoyance becomes associated with these old emotions. Following is a list ofsome common magnifying thoughts. II This is just like last time. III He is always doing this to me. l1li Here we go again; this is endless. 87 III I am always being treated this way. III I can\\'t let this happen again. The second type of magnifYing thought is one where you are guessing at the motives of others. The following thoughts have the effect of increasing a sense of victimization and anger. II1II He is doing this on purpose, to mess with me. II He thinks my feelings are unimportant. II He has no respect for me. II I am sick and tired of being manipulated. IIlI They are out to get me. It is important to recognize these thoughts as you have them, so you can successfully coach yourself through conflicts. The idea is to reduce the impact of your anger and irritability on your relationships and personal goals. Solving the Issue Right Away Anger can cloud your perception of a particular issue or event. If you are angry or frustrated, you may feel that you need to solve the issue at hand right away. However, it is always a better idea to give yourself some time to cool down before making a rash decision in an effort to solve the problem that very minute. Win or Lose Thinking Thinking about having to win an argument can prevent you from making more useful choices in a time of irritability and anger. Even when you know that stopping an argument is the best option, your anger and frustration may keep you in the mood to prolong the conflict. Try to avoid this at all costs. Remind yourself that you don\\'t need to win the argument. Instead, you need to maximize how well your life is going. 88 Value Your life Goals Don\\'t let your anger get in the way of pursuing and achieving your life goals. When you feel irritated or frustrated, ask yourself what you can do at that moment that would serve you better than getting angry. Guide yourself toward effectiveand calm action. Behavioral Analysis The first step in anger management is to think about a time when you became angry, irritable, or frustrated and conduct a step-by-step analysis of the event. It is important to identify as many thoughts, behaviors, and feelings that preceded the angry outburst as possible. Your therapist will work with you to conduct the analysis and show you how you can use cognitive restructuring and problemsolving techniques to avoid anger episodes in the future. As a first step, you should begin using the Thought Record to identify the thoughts that tend to increase your anger. These are your warning signs. Once you become familiar with your warning signs and how to recognizethem early on, you can then begin to manage them, giving you more power over your angry reactions. Use the Thought Record over the next several weeks. Additional copies can be found in the appendix at the end of the book. 89 Thought Record Situation (Describe the event that led to the unpleasant emotion) Emotion (Specify sad, angry, etc., and rate the emotion from 0% to 100%) Automatic thought (Write the automatic thought and rate your belief in the thought from 0% to 100%) Evaluation of automatic thought (Evaluate the accuracy of the automatic thought) Re-rate emotion (Re-rate the emotion and your belief in the thought from 0% to 100%) 90 ase4  Improving Well-Being Introduction to W,II-Being Therapy Over the last few months in treatment, you have learned a wide range of strategies for better managing your disorder. Most of these strategies were directed at reducing mood episodes and those situations and events that can trigger them. To complement the work you\\'ve done so far, this phase of the program will focus on increasing your positive emotions and feelings ofwell-being. Well-being refers to moments when you feel happy and satisfied. This is not to be confused with periods of hypomania, however. We are not referring to moments of particular excitement, achievement, or superiority, but of much quieter moments ofwell-being. Asa first step toward focusing on increasing pleasure and maximizing your enjoyment of life, it is important to clearly define your \"meaning of life.\" What is the purpose of life for you? What is it all about? What are you supposed to do while you are alive, and what is the role of fun, of work, and of relationships in your life? Use the space provided to define those things that are important to you in life. My Meaning of Ufe 93 Now that you have clearly identified and defined the areas of life that are most important to you, the next step is to begin monitoring your periods ofwell-being. Buy a journal or notebook that appeals to you and represents who you are and use it as your well-being diary. The purpose of a well-being diary is to help you recognize and attend to the pleasant moments in life. Use the diary nightly to record the times that day when you felt most happy and satisfied. Write down the day, time, and the situation, as well as the thoughts and feelings you had at the time you were feeling well. Over time, the well-being diary becomes a catalog of the times in your life that are working well. Use this catalog to review and plan for more periods ofwell-being in your life. Be sure to bring your diary with you to the remaining sessions. Your therapist will review your diary and help you come up with ways of continuing periods ofwell-being. In addition to recording the pleasant moments in your life, we want to make sure that you are adept at \"echoing\" and increasing these moments. Echoing refers to the process of making sure that a pleasant event has reverberations during the day. If you take a moment each day to reflect on a period of well-being, you are more likely to plan additional pleasant activities and reduce the likelihood that you will experience a depressed mood. The goal is for you to become good at noticing the range of situations and events that increase your well-being and use this information to enhance those feelings in your life. 94 The EndofTreatment As you have discussed with your therapist, the end of a formal treatment program should not be the end ofyour treatment. Instead, the end ofregular sessions with your therapist signals the beginning of your own program of therapy to extend your treatment gains. That is, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is not just a method of short-term treatment; it is an ongoing way of approaching life issues. After formal treatment ends, we want you to continue to apply the same caring, problem-solving focus that you used in formal treatment. Treatment emphasized the role of thoughts, activities, and problem solving in enjoying life. You learned not to accept automatic thoughts but to monitor and evaluate the ideas going through your mind. In addition, you were introduced to the idea of using thoughts in self-coaching, to make sure that you are actively guiding yourself effectively in life. You also devoted time to assessing your schedule and making sure that your schedule supported you and your interests, including break times and pleasant events as well as times for working on your goals. All of these strategies were introduced in the context of a step-by-step review of life problems and potential solutions. We want you to keep this focus on solutions and increasing periods ofwell-being. To help you complete your transition to managing your own treatment, we have provided you with ReviewSheets. These sheets are designed to remind you to take an active part in your treatment and to underscore the importance of occasional reviews of progress and problems. We want you to treat each review as if it were a return visit to therapy. In fact, take a moment right now to schedule appointments with yourself. On the following pages, write in the appointment dates for sessions, and then hold the sessions with yourself at the appointed times. These brief reviews of symptoms and methods should help you maintain and extend your treatment gains. Maintaining treatment gains does not mean that you always will be in a good mood in the future. In fact, we guarantee that you will have some difficulties with your mood sometime in the next several months. We guarantee it because almost everyone has these difficulties as a result ofstress or other life issues.When this happens, take the experience as a signal that you need to review the skillsyou 95 learned in treatment and put them to use. Ifyou experience symptoms of mania, then you already know to contact your physician as soon as possible to evaluate your medication needs. Likewise, ifstronger feelings ofsad or blue mood persist, make sure to contact your doctor and keep applying the skills you learned in treatment. At any point, you may want to contact your therapist for a \"tune-up.\" Sometimes a brief meeting with a therapist can go a long way in helping you continue on the right track with your goals.   Introduction What We Know About Anger We all have experienced anger and know subjectively what it is. If you break anger down, it\\'s composed of three elements-emotional, physiological, and cognitive or mental. These elements arise and combine so quickly that they are experienced nearly simultaneously. However, to really understand how anger works, we need to look at each of the three elements separately Emotionally, anger is a set of feelings. It exists as a range, from feeling mild annoyance and irritation to frustration and moderate anger to high anger states of being furious, enraged, livid, and the like. Physiologically, people are hardwired with the capacity to experience anger. Physical aspects of anger are triggered with the fight/flight reaction that readies YOll to respond to threats and stresses. Although no single individual is likely to experience all of the following reactions and sensations, there are several common physiological elements of anger. During the fight/flight reaction, the body mobilizes for large muscle activity. Heart rate and blood pressure increase, and blood is redistributed from the internal organs and skin to the large muscles of the body. This leads to physical anger symptoms such as heart palpitations, a sense of blood pounding in one\\'s head, hot sensations, flushes and reddening of the skin. The autonomic nervous system increases muscle tension, leading to a general feeling of tension or to specific areas of muscle tightness such as clenched jaws, clenched fists, or tension in the shoulders. The adrenal glands dump adrenaline, noradrenaline, and various corticoid steroids, which may lead to trembling plus a sense of restlessness and agitation. You may start pacing about, feeling tense, keyed up, or jumpy, and experience an exaggerated startle response. The body also tries to cool down, which may lead to sweating and cold, clammy hands. Breathing often shifts to short, shallow breaths. Gastrointestinal upset is sometimes present (e.g., stomach upset, nausea, and diarrhea). These are some of the most common physical manifestations of anger, but you may notice unique signs of physiological arousal that are consistent for you (e.g., an itchy, twitchy feeling in the hands and fingers, tapping or drumming of fingers, or jiggling of legs, etc.). If anger is frequent or lasts for long periods of time, it may also manifest itself physically in things such as migraines or tension headaches, grinding of one\\'s teeth, ulcer flare-ups, and the like. Anger is also a mental or cognitive event. Anger is reflected in how you think. Exact thoughts will vary from person to person and with the type of situation, but anger is frequently connected to the following types of thought patterns. Believing that you have been treated unfairly, violated, or trespassed upon Seeing yourself as a victim (most often an innocent victim), and someone or something else as the persecuting enemy Expecting that others, and/or life, be exactly as you desire and believing that it\\'s horrible, terrible, and awful when those demands are not met Believing that others have intentionally made negative things happen, or tried to hurt, harm, harass, or otherwise treat you badly Externalizing the source of problems (e.g., flit/they did it to me\"), and blaming others or outside events for your angry feelings Labeling people, things, and events in highly negative (e.g., horrible, awful), overgeneralized (e.g., always/never, worthless, totally stupid), and/or obscene ways (e.g., cursing, name calling, derogatory labeling, etc.) Fantasies of harm, revenge, or retaliation Brooding or rumination (e.g., turning over and over in your mind how badly and unjustly you\\'ve been treated or repeatedly thinking about some past offense) Thinking of justifications for angry or aggressive behavior Believing that you shouldn\\'t have to deal with or endure negative or frustrating events (e.g., \"1 shouldn\\'t have to put up with this\") The net result of these anger-triggering thoughts is to intensify your angry feelings. They are like putting a match to a haystack. While no one experiences all of these thought patterns, anyone thought can potentially push you out of control. The distinction between feelings, physical sensations, and thoughts is very important for treating anger. You can learn to control and manage angry feelings by doing two things: 1) developing key skills to relax your body, and 2) replacing anger-triggering thoughts with coping thoughts. This manual will show you how to calm yourself in a way that makes it difficult to get angry. Then you\\'ll learn to recognize incendiary thoughts that tend to ignite your anger, and to change them into more accurate and realistic thinking. Before getting underway, it may be helpful to get a bit more background in what research has taught us about anger. Knowledge is power. The more you know 2 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger about anger, the more ways you\\'ll find to manage it and protect yourself from its damage. What Research Tells Us About Anger What people become angry about, how angry they get, the form their anger takes, and the targets of their anger are mostly learned. Early parent-child interactions can model and reinforce dysfunctional anger. Children who witness parents abusing one another or who are the targets of physical, psychological, and/or sexual abuse are more likely to experience difficulties in managing their anger and in expressing it constructively. These children are more likely than their peers to experience outbursts of uncontrolled anger, to behave more aggressively, to experience more peer difficulties, to have more difficulties in school, to engage in more delinquent, and/or antisocial behavior, and to become abusive parents themselves, to name just a few negative outcomes. Peer groups can also be a big influence on your experience and expression of anger. For example, many peer groups support anger and aggression (e.g., groups that condone revenge and bullying of other groups). Cultural forces such as the media also shape the experience and expression of anger. For example, the research literature shows that both television and video games may model and reinforce aggressive behavior, desensitizing youth to violence, and making it seem acceptable. Our families, peers, and society at large teach us three things that can crank up our anger. First, they may teach us that certain situations are highly threatening, attacking, insulting, or frustrating, when, in fact, these situations are fairly benign. We end up responding to these exaggerated hurts and attacks, rather than to the real threat value. Second, they show us when and how to blow up. They model for us how pain and problems can be controlled with anger. Third, they often condone anger, making it an acceptable and reasonable response. Research suggests that a person\\'s anger at any moment in time comes from an interactions of three things: 1) one or more things triggering anger; 2) the state you\\'re in at the time of provocation; and 3) how you interpret what\\'s happening (your appraisals). Triggers of Anger Approximately three-quarters of anger episodes involve other people (Averill 1982, 1983; Deffenbacher 1993; Deffenbacher, Oetting, Thwaites et a1. 1996). Of these 75 percent are well knm\\\\\\'TI and liked and another 8 percent are well known and disliked, whereas only 13 percent are strangers (Averill 1982, 1983). People respond with anger to a wide variety of things. For some, anger is prompted by a specific situation like being treated unfairly at work. Other triggers may involve provocations such as a critical comment or back talk from a teenager. Twenty to 25 percent of triggers don\\'t involve people. Often they are objects, such as malfunctioning equipment or a car that won\\'t start. They could be impersonal Introduction 3 events, such as weather that spoils weekend plans or traffic. In still other cases, the trigger might involve your own behavior. For example, being angry at yourself for a poor performance, for saying embarrassing things, or for being overweight and out of shape. In all of these cases, some specific event or condition appears to stimulate anger. In other instances, anger can be triggered by the memories and images stimulated by a current event. For example, an individual who was physically or psychologically abused as a child may blow up when even mildly criticized. The reaction isn\\'t in proportion, but the criticism pulls out strong emotional memories of early abuse and hurt. Anger can be triggered by painful feelings. For example, you may react with anger to feeling hurt, embarrassed, ashamed, rejected, or criticized. Other internal triggers are more mental than emotionaL For example, you might brood or ruminate about some event (e.g., how a former partner or employer treated you unfairly). As you turn past injustices over and over in your mind, you become more and more angry. In these cases, it isn\\'t the external events that trigger the anger-because they are not even present-it\\'s the thoughts and images you keep dwelling on. The State of the Person at the Time of Anger Anger is tremendously influenced by your immediate mental, emotional, and physical state. If you\\'re feeling well and in a calm, relaxed state of mind, you are much less likely to become angry. The positive state of affairs seems to buffer angry feelings. Other conditions can lower the threshold for anger. Already being angry is one of these. Even if the source of the prior anger has nothing to do with the subsequent situation, an irritated or angry person is likely to react with more intense anger. Such carryover effects aren\\'t limited just to anger. Research has shown that almost any negative mental, emotional, or physical state can have such an effect. For example, being sick, fatigued, hungry, stressed, worried, anxious, hung over, or tired can increase the odds of reacting with anger. Such conditions seem to prime the anger pump. Anger is also strongly influenced by your values, expectations, beliefs, rules for living, goals, and things you care about. Violation of beliefs, values, and rules for living can lead to anger. Intense, problematic anger comes about when values and personal codes of conduct cease to be guidelines for living but are instead rigid dogma. When your beliefs become absolute dictates, when your expectations become laws, and when your goals become imperatives, anger often becomes a serious problem. Cultural background also influences your anger. Every culture has norms for the experience and expression of anger. Culture also dictates who are appropriate and inappropriate targets. Understanding these implicit cultural rules can be important for understanding your anger. How You Interpret Things The way you interpret anger triggers and your own coping resources will have a big impact on your anger. Anger increases if you see the provoking event as an 1LJ:!1 1$ AJ:%l \" #.mW(M.jmJ~:_$lfl!oJ!.*)l*_ Wl\\'!>\\'S.&I&.lJ>l1l!% - lm;; ;m_$~ 4 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger affront or insult, a violation Cllf important values and rules for living, a breaking of a promise or an expectation, or the blocking of a goal. The level of your anger is likely to go up with any of the fo1Jowing ways of interpreting things: 1) the situation is unjustified, unwarranted, or\\' undeserved (i.e., \"I don\\'t deserve this\"); 2) the situation was controllable and preventable (i.e., \"If it could have been prevented, then it should have been prevented\"); 3) the situation is intentional or on purpose (i.e., \"It was done to me deliberately\"); 4) the person involved is totally responsible, blameworthy, and deserving of punishment (i.e., \"He or she is to blame and should pay\"). All of these externalize the source of anger, intensify it, and increase the probability of attack. How you see your own coping capacity also affects anger. Anger is more likely if you are feeling overtaxed, overwhelmed, out of control, or unable to cope. Anger-prone people often feel that they shouldn\\'t have to experience, put up with, or deal with the triggering event. That is, they think that they should not have to deal with frustration, disappointment, hassle, or inconvenience. Their anger seems reasonable since they shouldn\\'t have to put up with these problems in the first place. Perhaps the most trouble-making idea you can have is that anger and aggression are appropriate responses to a situation. The anger is experienced as normal, natural, flnd expected. There\\'s no reason to hold back when blowing up seems like what any reasonable person would do. Forms of Anger Expression Resemch has outlined a number of styles people use to express their anger (e.g., Deffenbacher, Oetting, Lynch, and Morris 1996; Morris, Deffenbacher, Lynch, and Oetting 1996; Spielberger 1988, 1999). Some are positive and adaptive. Reciprocal communicatiol1 is one example in which you express your feelings but try to listen to the feelings and preferences of others, using these to seek mutually satisfying solutions. Another form of positive expression involves tllinking before responding. You delay responding and attempt to consider all possible consequences. Another positive way to deal with anger is taking a time-out, where you distance yourself from the provocation until you can express yourself calmly. Finally, people attempt to control anger by lowering arousal (e.g., using relaxation techniques to calm down). Other forms of anger expression are more problematic. The obvious example is assault...;...hitting, slapping, punching, or kicking others. Not all physical assault is directed toward people. Another form of anger expression is physical assault on obiects (e.g., kicking, throwing, slamming, and pounding on things, rather than people). People also express their anger through Z\\'erbal assault, which involves plltting the other person down, making cutting and sarcilstic remarks, name calling, and the like. Others turn the volume up, becoming loud and argumentative. Other kinds of anger expression are nonverbal. For example, dirty looks involves the person expressing anger through icy stares, glares, and rolling of their eyes. Another nonverbal dimension involves how the rest of the body is used to communicate anger. Negative body langllage can send potent anger messages through sighs, crossed arms, hilnds on hips, and the like. A final form of anger expression is allger-in. A person Introduction 5 experiences anger, but stuffs or holds it back. This often results in hidden grudges and hostile, retaliatory thoughts. Anger Consequences Not all anger leads to negative outcomes. People often report that the outcomes of anger are positive, things such as clarifying issues and relationships, bringing people closer together, increasing respect for others, and realizing one\\'s own faults. Some studies have shown that positive outcomes outnumber negative outcomes as much as three to one (Averill 1982, 1983). Other studies, however, found that as many as two-thirds of angry incidents resulted in negative outcomes with only 15 percent of incidents resulting in improved feelings or outcomes (Meltzer 1933). While the research isn\\'t consistent, there are certainly some occasions when anger can mobilize a person to deal with a problem with positive results. However, especially as anger escalates or is repeated, the probability of negative consequences increases (e.g., Deffenbacher, Oetting, Lynch, et al. 1996; Deffenbacher, Oetting, Thwaites, et al. 1996; Morris, Deffenbacher, Lynch, and Oetting 1996). For example, anger is correlated with health problems. People sustain injury from doing things such as getting into a physical fight, punching a wall and breaking a hand, or having an automobile crash stemming from angry, reckless driving. Other health consequences are much less immediate, but no less important. For example, elevated anger is associated with coronary artery disease, high blood pressure, compromised immune systems, and dental problems, such as grinding one\\'s teeth. Anger often influences relationships negatively, leading others to withdraw or counterattack with the potential for physical violence and injury. Anger is often a major factor in damaged friendships and family relationships, as well as increased difficulties at work or in educational pursuits. There is also the issue of how anger makes you feel about yourself. Being highly angry and expressing it aggressively often leads a person to feel bad, guilty, and ashamed. In summary, while anger and healthy anger expression can sometimes lead to positive outcomes, intense anger and aggression can lead to large negative consequences for you and those around you. Anger and Mental Health Problems Generally, anger is an overlooked, understudied problem. A review of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fourth Edition (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), the primary diagnostic system in the U.S., shows that there are a large number of disorders that are defined either by problems of anxiety or depression, but none for anger problems. For example, there are diagnoses for people who are chronically worried and anxious or chronically depressed, but none for chronically angry people. If a person is highly fearful of and avoids specific situations (e.g., driving a car or being criticized), the person has a phobia, but if he or she becomes highly angry in exactly the same situations, this is not considered a diagnosable problem. However, just because the mental health system hasn\\'t officially recognized anger problems, that doesn\\'t mean that people don\\'t suffer from anger and that their concerns are not worthy of treatment. \\' 6 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger What We Know About Treating Anger Treatmept of anger problems has lagged far behind the treatment of other emotional issues such as anxiety and depression. There are now, however, research and clinical trials that point to effective ways of helping people lower and manage their anger. Medioal Approaohes Initial clinical trials suggest that serotonin reuptake inhibitor drugs such as Prozac may help some people control their anger. For example, encouraging results have been found with borderline personality disorder patients who have significant problems in anger and impulse control (Cocarro and Kavoussi 1997) and for people suffering \\'Ianger attacks\" (Fava, Rosenbaum, Pava, et aL 1993; Rosenbaum, Fava, Pava, et aL 1993). Other drugs are promising, and this is likely to be an emerging and rapidly changing field in the near future. If medications are thought to be of potential value, it is suggested that you and your therapist work closely with a psychiatrist who can evaluate the literature and prescribe and monitor medications. Counseling and Psyohotherapy There are many different approaches to counseling and psychotherapy. Some focus on understanding one\\'s childhood and the kinds of traumas and difficulties experienced growing up. From this perspective, current anger problems are a direct or indirect playing out of these earlier issues. There\\'s an expectation that as you uncover, explore, and understand these issues, the underlying basis of anger will be resolved and anger will dissipate. Current anger often has its roots in earlier history, and some people may be helped by this approach to therapy. Other approaches focus primarily on your feelings and reactions in the moment and in the relationship with a therapist. Such models of therapy often assume that strong angry feelings, along with many other negative emotions, reflect a kind of inner estrangement-not trusting and not being grounded in one self. Therefore, the therapist attempts to deeply understand the client\\'s feelings and internal world and to communicate this understanding in the context of a warm, open, accepting therapeutic relationship. As the client feels understood and experiences greater self-acceptance, then he or she becomes centered and grounded and has less need for anger. Certainly, high quality therapeutic relationships are important to all forms of therapy, and some people are helped by such approaches. Another approach to anger problems involves intense expression of the anger. Clients are encouraged to ventilate their angry feelings by pounding pillows or hitting a punching bag while swearing and shouting. The goal is to drain off the excessive, pent-up feelings of anger. Such approaches often lead to an immediate emotional release and some relief from angry feelings, but this strategy is not generally recommended. While providing some immediate relief, this experience actually appears to strengthen angry feelings and aggressive behavior. While the person is Introduction 7 engaging in an intense emotional release, they\\'re often having many angry, hostile, potentially revengeful and violent thoughts. They\\'re aroused and shouting epithets while beating the hell out of a pillow. The trouble with releasing a rage response is that it makes it easier-not harder-to get angry in the future. Research tells us that you\\'re more likely to feel angry and behave aggressively toward target people when you\\'ve \"practiced\" your anger in these ventilation sessions (Deffenbacher 1994). So they compound the problem in the long run. Although these general approaches to counseling are appealing and some angry individuals may have been helped by them, there is no current scientific or research evidence to support their effectiveness for anger management. An Overview of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Cognitive behavioral approaches to therapy assume that most emotional problems are a result of how the person has learned to cope with life. The therapist forms a close working relationship with the client, and together they do a careful assessment of the personal and situational contributors to anger. They identify alternative ways to think, feel, and behave in provocative situations. Then, they construct new learning experiences so that the client can practice more effective ways of handling the situation. The remainder of this section is a summary of the research supporting the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for anger-what you\\'ll be learning in this manual. It\\'s rather detailed, and you can safely skip it if you prefer. Three recent studies (Beck and Fernandez 1998; Edmondson and Conger 1996; Trafate 1995) and a general review of the anger management literature (Deffenbacher, Oetting, and DiGiuseppe 1999) strongly support cognitive behavioral approaches to anger reduction. There is now a body of evidence for the effectiveness of three types of cOgnitive behavioral interventions: 1) relaxation approaches focus on emotional and physiological arousal and teach you how to apply relaxation to calm down; 2) cognitive approaches help you identify and change thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes that fuel anger. As you learn to think things through in more calm, realistic ways, you\\'re also able to engage in better problem solving; and 3) social!communication-skill approaches help you find more adaptive ways of expressing anger and handling conflict. You can learn new ways of listening, providing feedback, negotiating, taking time out, and being assertive with others. As you become more skilled, confidence in dealing with anger and conflict increases. The cognitive-relaxation coping skills (CRCS) approach used in this manual is a combination of the relaxation and cognitive interventions outlined above and has been extensively tested since the early 1980s. When our research group began investigating anger reduction, very few scientifically sound studies had been published. Our initial research explored the effectiveness of the individual relaxation and cognitive components of CRCS. In the first study (Deffenbacher, Demm, and Brandon 1986), a group of generally angry 8 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger individuals received relaxation coping skills training and were compared to a group of generally angry individuals who received no counseling. Compared to the untreatep control, the relaxation intervention lowered anger and general anxiety. Both anger and anxiety reduction for the relaxation group was maintained at onemonth and one-year follow-up, suggesting long-term effectiveness as welL Other studies evaluating the relaxation intervention with generally angry individuals (Deffenbacher and Stark 1992; Hazaleus and Deffenbacher 1986) and with angry drivers (Deffenbacher, Huff, Lynch, Oetting, and Salvatore, in press; Deffenbacher, Lynch, Filetti, Oetting, and Dahlen 1999) confirmed that the relaxation intervention lowers anger and that anger reduction is maintained over time. Another study evaluated the effects of the cognitive coping skill component (Hazaleus and Deffenbacher 1986). Changing anger-triggering thoughts and beliefs (cognitive coping skills) lowered anger, and anger reduction was maintained at one-month and one-year follow-ups. A later study with generally angry individuals confirmed that the cognitive intervention lowered anger in the short- and long-term (Deffenbacher, Story, Brandon, Hogg, and Hazaleus 1988). Studies by others (Achmon, Granek, Golomb, and Hart 1989; Dua and Swinden 1992; Moon and Eisler 1983; Novaco 1975) have also confirmed the positive effects of similar cognitive interventions. Thus, the cognitive coping skills component also appears effective for anger reduction. These studies raised the possibility that cognitive and relaxation interventions might be combined for even greater effect. The first study looking at this possibility (Deffenbacher, Story, Brandon, et aL 1988) compared the combined cognitive and relaxation interventions (CRCS) to the cognitive coping skills only group and to a control group of generally angry individuals. Compared to the control, both CRCS and cognitive coping skills interventions lowered anger, and anger reduction was still evident fifteen months later. This study supported the effectiveness of CRCS but didn\\'t show enhanced effects when the cognitive approach was combined with relaxation. However, CRCS solved a practical problem that was discovered in this and a previous study (Hazaleus and Deffenbacher 1986). Clients in the cognitive treatment group struggled with and fought the initial stages of cognitive intervention. However, when the cognitive intervention was preceded by relaxation in CRCS, this type of struggle and resistance was eliminated. CRCS seemed to flow more easily and to reduce difficulties in the cognitive intervention. Additional studies from our research group have shown CRCS to be effective with generally angry young adults (Deffenbacher, McNamara, Stark, and Sabadell 1990; Deffenbacher, Story, Stark, Hogg, and Brandon 1987; DeHenbacher, Oetting, Huff, Cornell, and Dallager 1996; Deffenbacher and Stark 1992; Deffenbacher, Thwaites, Wallace, and Oetting 1994L generally angry junior high students (Deffenbacher, Lynch, Oetting, and Kemper 1996), and angry drivers (Deffenbacher, Huff, Lynch, Oetting, and Salvatore in press; Deffenbacher, Lynch, Piletti, et at 1999). CRCS interventions also have lowered anger in generally angry youth, college students, and adult community samples, incarcerated delinquents, and police officers, findings which support its application with a wide range of angry people. In fact, to date, CRCS has more studies supporting its effectiveness than any other cognitive or behavioral intervention (Deffenbacher, Oetting et al. 1999). Anger reduction for CRCS has been consistently maintained in short- and long-term follow-ups (Deffenbacher 1988; Deffenbacher, McNamara, Stark, and Sabadell 1990, Introduction 9 Deffenbacher, Lynch, Oetting, et a1. 1996: Deffenbacher, Filetti, Lynch, et a1. 1999; Deffenbacher, Oetting, Huff et a1. 1996; Deffenbacher, Oetting, Huff, and Thwaites 1995; Deffenbacher and Stark 1992), which show that acquiring these coping skills will help you in the long term. Why CRCS Is Recommended. This manual is recommending CRCS as a basic approach to anger reduction for the following reasons. First, it is the most thoroughly and scientific evaluated intervention to date. Second, it lowers anger, and produces long-lasting results. Third, there is evidence that the effects of CRCS generalize to other sources of emotional upset (Deffenbacher and Lynch 1998), suggesting that people are learning a general set of cognitive and relaxation coping skills that they can apply in many aspects of their lives. Fourth, it\\'s effective with a wide range of angry individuals. Fifth, the relaxation element helps to eliminate discomfort and resistance with the cognitive interventions. Finally, it\\'s effective whether the anger is expressed toward others or held inside. Clients in CRCS are learning to cope not only with anger involving others, but with all other sources of anger as well. CRCS is, therefore, recommended as a basic anger management intervention. Duration of Treatment CRCS typically takes from nine to twelve sessions. Depending on the nature of your anger problems, one to three sessions will be devoted to building rapport, getting an understanding of your anger problems, and making decisions about the appropriate approach to treating your anger. Cognitive and relaxation coping skill training typically takes the next seven to nine sessions. The first two will focus heavily on relaxation. The third session introduces cognitive change procedures. Subsequent sessions start with a review of homework, followed by twenty to thirty minutes developing a new cognitive coping responses. Then, twenty to thirty minutes will be spent practicing cognitive and relaxation skills to cope with anger. To practice coping skills, you\\'ll start by visualizing situations that have made you angry in the past. Then, you\\'ll use relaxation and cognitive coping strategies to lower your anger. A few minutes at the end of the session will be spent in reviewing what was learned and setting up homework assignments for the coming week. You and your therapist may decide to lengthen the interval between the last session or two in order to give you more time to practice and consolidate anger reduction skills. You may also schedule occasional follow-up sessions, say one and four months after your last session, to make sure you\\'re staying on track. You may also extend therapy if, after successful CRCS, other issues remain. 10 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger Goals of Treatment People with anger problems have learned to react with heightened angry arousal, to think about situations in anger-triggering ways, and often to respond aggressively. If anger is an acquired, learned reaction, then anger can be lowered by learning alternative ways of thinking about and coping with angering situations. CRCS is designed to do exactly that. It provides ways of learning relaxation and cognitive coping skills that can help you lower anger. In general, the goals of CRCS are to help you develop a set of skills to diminish your anger and its negative effects. More specifically, over the course of CRCS, you should achieve the following goals: 1. You should become more aware of: a) the situations that trigger your anger; b) the ways you think about yourself and those situations; c) the ways you responds emotionally, physically, cognitively, and behaviorally; and d) the outcomes or consequences of these responses. Enhanced awareness will help you pay attention to physical, mental, and situational \"red flags\" that tell you it\\'s time to use your coping skills. 2. Vou should develop one or more effective relaxation coping skills and be able to relax and calm down when you feel yourself becoming angry. You can\\'t be both relaxed and angry at the same time. As you develop and deploy relaxation skills, you\\'ll be able to calm down, think more dearly, and choose more effective ways of dealing with the situation. 3. Vou should develop a series of anger-lowering cognitive strategies. People often think in ways that intensify anger (e.g., name calling, demanding things be a certain way, thinking things were done intentionally to you) and then respond to their own negative thoughts, rather than to reality. Cognitive coping skill training will help you identify and change anger-escalating thoughts. As you think in calmer, more reality-based, problem-focused WElys, you\\'ll experience less anger arousal, think things through more effectively, and choose better ways of expressing your feelings. 4. You should receive enough practice within and between sessions to become confident in using your new skills for anger reduction. You didn\\'t learn to be angry in a day. It has taken a lifetime to learn your anger response, and, unfortunately, there is no magic bullet for anger reduction. Old anger patterns are habitual, and new anger reduction strategies are relatively weak, especially in the beginning. You\\'ll need to practice your new cognitive and relaxation skills so they become \"overlearned,\" like second nature to you. Effective anger management is a long-term project, and you\\'ll need to continue using these skills long after counseling has ended. 5. YOll should plan and rehearse for future problems so that you have effective strategies in place. You should also know how to access your therapist in the future should the need arise. Anger reduction is not perfect, and you may need a few booster sessions in the future Introduction 11 Self-Rating Scales During the first session or two, your therapist will ask you a number of questions and explore your anger during the interview. He or she will also have you fill out some questionnaires and have you begin monitoring your anger. You will also complete them again about half way through and at the end of therapy (Le., at about sessions 5 and 9). As part of this assessment and self-monitoring, you are likely to be asked to complete three brief measures-the State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI), the Anger Situation, and the Anger Symptom. The last two questionnaires can be found at the end of the next chapter. The STAXI is composed of three parts. The first fifteen items ask you how much anger you are feeling at the time you\\'re completing the questionnaire, and how you feel like responding to that anger physically and verbally. The next ten items measure how you generally feel or react-your usual tendencies. If you complete the Trait Anger Scale at different points in therapy, say after sessions 5 and 9, you can get a sense of whether your anger is generally dropping over time. The last thirty-two items of the STAXI assess how you express your anger. For example, whether you hold it in or express it outwardly or whether you make attempts to control how you express your anger. Not all anger is experienced generally, however. Some anger happens in very specific situations. The Anger Situation asks about such anger by having you describe the ongoing situation in your life that leads to the greatest amount of anger. After you describe this situation, you rate the intensity of your anger on a 0-100 scale. This gives you and your therapist a sense of how hot your anger is in that particular circumstance. The Anger Situation also asks you how frequently and how long you respond with anger, and how much the anger interferes with your life. You may also complete the Anger Situation at different points in therapy to see if you are managing your anger more effectively in that part of your life. The Anger Symptom is a similar measure, but asks you about your strongest physical anger reactions. First you describe your strongest anger symptom, and then rate its severity on a 0-100 scale. The Anger Symptom may also ask you about ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~it~ feres with your life. You can complete the Anger Symptom at different points in therapy to see if you are making changes in managing your physical anger reactions. The Importance of Agenda Setting You and your therapist will work together to understand and address your anger issues. On the one hand, you want your therapist to be sensitive to you and the things that are important to you. On the other hand, you want to use therapy time wisely and effectively. You\\'re encouraged to bring up any vital issue, but resist getting side tracked onto minor problems. To help keep focused, you and your therapist will outline your agenda at the beginning of each session. If the two of you have a clear agenda, you will be more likely to achieve those goals within the 12 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger session. This way you can work together to stay on task, but at the same time make sure that important issues are discussed. The Importance of Homework If talking about anger led to effective anger management, then you would probably already have control of your anger. Anger management is hard work and takes more than simply talking. It takes a great deal of effort and practice. CRCS can\\'t be accomplished in just one hour a week. In fact, most of the work is done outside the session. Assignments or homework between sessions are, therefore, vitally important. In the initial sessions, completing questionnaires, monitoring and recording your anger, and similar assignments are critical to understanding the nature of your anger and how to treat it. Over time, homework provides an ongoing assessment of how things are progressing and helps you practice cognitive and relaxation skills. Without practice, you will not develop the skills needed to combat anger. But just havil1g skills still isn\\'t enough to overcome anger. You need to practice them in real angering situations. In latter stages of CRC5, you \"vill actively practice your new skills in confronting anger in your day-to-day living. Again, you will record your efforts and share these with you therapist so that the two of you can celebrate things that are going well, troubleshoot problems, and hone an effective set of skills. To summarize, you should enter into CRC5 with an expectation that you will be doing a lot of practicing and skill building between sessions. You\\'ll record what happens and share this information with your therapist to aid in future treatment decisions and ongoing development of anger-management skills. 50 expect homework, and if you are not clear about any given assignment, make sure to clarify \"vith your therapist before leaving the session. Introduction 13  Assessment and Treatment Planning Agenda This is your first session, and you can hope to achieve many things during this first week or two. By the end of this assessment phase, you should: 1) begin to establish a good working relationship with your therapist; 2) clarify your goals for therapy; 3) assess and understand your anger better; and 4) decide on a course of treabnent, including whether a cognitive-relaxation coping skills approach (CRCS) is appropriate. The first session is very packed, and achieving its goals sometimes takes more than a single, one-hour session. Nonetheless, you can do a number of things to facilitate and move this session along. Your New Learning: The Therapeutic Relationship What can you expect from your therapist? You should expect that your therapist will listen carefully to you and try to underst,md things from your point of view. Your therapist may not see everything the same way you do, but you should feel cared about, respected, and invited to talk. The two of you should also agree on two things. First, you will need to agree on the goals of therapy. Sometimes, this isn\\'t as easy as it sounds. For example, if you think other people shouldn\\'t provoke you, then the goal of therapy would be to get them to anger you less. On the other hand, if your therapist suggests that you can learn to reduce your angry reactivity to others, then the goal is for you to learn ways to reduce your anger. In this case, the two of you are not agreeing to the same goals of therapy. If therapy is to be beneficial, you and your therapist must be headed in the same direction. Second, you need to agree on how to reach therapeutic goals. There are many possible ways to try to lower anger, but you and your therapist need to agree on the approach. For example, if you thought anger reduction could be achieved through the use of medication, and your therapist suggested cognitive behavioral approaches, then the two of your are not in sync. In order for therapy to be effective it is critically important that the two of you are on the same page in terms of the goals for therapy and the means to reach those goals. Without agreement there is likely to be little progress and considerable frustration for both of you. Thus, by the end of the assessment phase, check and make sure that you feel positive about the relationship and that you and your therapist have the same goals and ideas about how to achieve them. Clarifying Your Goals Something about anger has been bothering you, or you would not be entering therapy at this time. But, what is it that you hope to achieve from therapy? General goals like being less angry and controlling your temper are fine, but the best goals are as specific as possible. Try to identify the who, what, when, and where of your goals. What would you like to have change? With whom? And under what circumstances? What would you like to have change in your relationships or environment? How would you like to feel or think differently? If counseling were successful, what specifically would you like to do differently? Concrete, personal goals facilitate change, so try to answer these types of questions and become clear with yourself about what you hope to achieve. The worksheet on page 17 may help to clarify these specific goals. If, after completing the worksheet, you still aren\\'t clear or certain, tell your therapist and make one of the goals for the first sessi~ns be exploring and clarifying this issue. Your Goals or Someone Else\\'s? There may also be the issue of others involved in your anger and your counseling. Does a spouse, a school, an employer, a lawyer, a probation officer, or someone else have expectations about your anger management? These questions may have little relevance to you, but some individuals with anger problems cpme to therapy in part because of pressure from others. If this is your situation, discuss it openly with your therapist and clarify what the issues are and how they will be addressed. Assessing and Understanding Your Anger One of the major goals of this session is to begin assessing and understanding your anger. Understanding your anger is not something that is done in the firs~ session and never reconsidered. To the contrary, it is an ongoing process that wIll go on throughout your therapy. Understanding anger is something like filling in the 16 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger Clarifying Your Goals Worksheet 1. Target individuals.

You and your therapist will develop a picture of your anger problems, including: your anger trigger momentary and lasting characteristics that influence anger how your evaluations and interpretations influence anger the mental, emotional, and physiological elements of your anger the behaviors you engage in when angry the consequences or outcomes of your anger You will also want to have a sense of the frequency, intensity, duration, and life complications of your anger. Your therapist will ask you a number of questions to assess and build shared understandings. He or she may ask you to do other things such as complete questionnaires and keep track of your anger reactions in an Anger Log in order to further understand your anger. You can facilitate this process by doing two things. First, you can think back on your anger and the just completed Clarifying Your Goals Worksheet. Try to identify two or three concrete examples of your anger reactions that you would most like to change. Sketch out the details so that you can describe them to your therapist much as if it were happening again. Top anger responses you want to change. Include details about when, where, with whom, and exactly what you do. L ~ _ 2. _ 3. _ The second way you can facilitate therapy is to think carefully about your anger reactions. To help with this, several elements of anger arousal are listed below, along with some questions for you to explore. In answering these questions, try to be as specific as possible. Make notes if you think that will help. 18 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger Triggers of Anger What triggers your anger? Is anger triggered primarily by external events? If so, what kinds of things are they (e.g., specific situations or objects, your behavior or the behavior of others)? Is anger triggered sometimes by external events that set off negative memories? If so, what are the memories and/or imagery involved? Does your anger follow primarily from other feelings (e.g., anxiety, stress, depression, guilt, shame, embarrassment, feeling out of control, etc.)? Does your anger sometimes follow periods of worry, brooding, and/or rumination? If so, what kinds of things are you brooding about? Note specifics about anger triggers below. Your Characteristics at the Moment of Anger Anger is influenced by your momentary state, by your enduring characteristics, and by your cultural and family background. Momentary State Is your anger influenced by your already being angry about other things? If so, can you predict when and where you will be angry and how this influences later angry behavior? Note specifics about the influence of prior anger below. Is your anger affected by the presence of other negative emotional or physical conditions (e.g., illness, fatigue, stress, hunger, jet lag, etc.)? If so, specify in the space below. Assessment and Treatment Planning 19 Enduring Attitudes, Beliefs, and Values Do you have any values, attitudes, or beliefs the violation of which really set you off? If so, what are they? Do you think that being angry and blowing off steam is a good thing? Do you think that being angry and aggressive are acceptable ways of feeling about and dealing with negative events? Note your responses in the space below. Your Cultural and Family Background What did your cultural background and family teach you about anger growing up? How much anger is acceptable? To whom may it be expressed? In what ways may it be expressed? How did your parents express anger? Is one or more members of your family prone to anger or aggression? If so, note who the individuals are, how they express anger (or keep it in), and their relationship to you. Be sure to tell your therapist if you experienced physical, psychological, or sexual abuse as a child. Note your cultural and family rules about anger in the space below. How You Evaluate Things Anger is influenced by the ways you interpret events and your coping capacities. Do you become angry when expectations or promises are broken? If so, what are these and who might break them? Do you become very angry when you are unable to achieve your goals? If so, which goals and what kinds of obstacles lead to anger? 20 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger Do you become angry when you feel overwhelmed or out of control? Do you think that you shouldn\\'t have to deal or put up with angering events? Do you feel angry when you don\\'t know how to deal with something? Do you think that being angry can help you deal with conflict and frustration? Write in your responses below. The Nature of Your Anger How do you experience anger emotionally? What words would you use to describe your anger (e.g., \"mad,\" \"pissed off,\" \"furious:\\' etc.)? How does anger manifest itself in your body (e.g., muscle tension, heart racing, sweating, etc.)? What are common thoughts you have when angry? Some thoughts may be primarily in terms of words, and others may be more in terms of pictures or small \"movies\" in your head. Note your emotional, physical, and thinking reactions when angry in the space below. -_ _- How do you typically express your anger (e.g., shouting, cursing, shoving, ridiculing, etc.)? Do you handle some potentially upsetting situations well? If so, describe what you do and hmv you do it. Identify any positive strategies you\\'ve developed for dealing with anger. Assessment and Treatment Planning 21  Consequences of Your Anger Anger may lead to many different outcomes. Some may be positive and constructive, others neutral, and still others negative and problematic. What happens to you when you handle angry situations poorly? Are these some of the reasons why you\\'re seeking counseling at this time? How is anger causing you pain, suffering, or other problems? Note the main negative consequences from your anger here? Your therapist will inquire about these and a number of other issues. For example, he or she will want to know any current medications you may be on or illnesses you may have and how they influence your anger. Your therapist may also inquire about use of drugs (e.g., caffeine, nicotine, etc.) and alcohol and how these influence your anger. Review of the Session and Selection of an Intervention Toward the end of the assessment process, you and your therapist should review what you have been discussing and make decisions about how to address your anger issues. This manual outlines a cognitive-relaxation coping skills (CRCS) approach for anger reduction. However, CRCS is not appropriate for everyone. For example, anger is sometimes part of a person\\'s depression or a reaction to stressful, traumatic events. Even though the person may experience anger problems, treatment should properly focus on the larger issues of depression or posttraumatic stress reactions. In other cases, a person may be angry, but also be the victim of a highly abusive situation. If this is occurring, the first priority is to stop the abuse and violence. Anger, if it remains an issue, can be dealt with later. Other people are angry but aren\\'t yet ready to change their anger. For example, they may feel that anger is part of their identity, essential to who they are. Attempting to lower anger goes against their basic sense of themselves (e.g., tough, right, indomitable, etc.). Anger reduction, therefore, does not fit, and they aren\\'t likely to invest in CRCS. Therapy should focus instead on identity issues and whether their anger is getting them all that they want out of life. You and your therapist will need to discuss these types of issues and decide whether CRCS is appropriate for you or not. CRCS has been proven helpful for individuals who experience a high level of emotional and physiological arousal when angry and who have ways of looking at and thinking about things that increase anger. CRCS is designed to proVide you with ways of relaxing and changing your thinking in order to lower your anger. Having these skills frees you to think things through differently, to make calmer 22 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger decisions, and to choose different ways to behave. CRCS is most effective for those who want to se~f-mant1ge their anger. It is designed to help you learn to pay attention to the e~ternal things that trigger anger, but particularly to the internal feelings of anger (e.g., tension in the chest and clenched jaws). Whenever and wherever you sense anger starting to build, you initiate your relaxation and thinking-change strategies to manage your anger. CRCS provides you with fundamental skills in regaining mental, emotional, and physical controL You and your therapist will discuss CRCS as a treatment option. Your therapist will describe the general goals and steps of CRCS. You should ask questions and clarify any issues you have. It\\'s important for you to fully understand and invest in treatment. If this process makes sense to you and you want to learn these types of skills, then CRCS is likely to help you manage your anger. Overview of the Treatment Plan Relaxation skills are developed in the first couple of sessions and refined thereafter. In the fourth session, cognitive (changing thoughts) coping skills are introduced and are further developed and honed throughout counseling. Starting about the fifth session, your therapist will have you practice your cognitive and relaxation coping skills to lower anger within the session. Generally, this will be done by having you visualize situations that have made you angry in the past. You will experience anger again for a few moments, and then employ the cognitive and relaxation skills to reduce anger. In the early sessions, the visualized anger scenes will be only moderately upsetting, and your therapist will help you to initiate relaxation and cognitive skills. Over time, as you get better and better at using your relaxation and cognitive coping skills, the anger level of the scenes will be increased. Your therapist will also decrease his or her help so that you are increasingly coping on your own. As you gain success, you will start applying your anger-management skills any time you become angry in real life. You may also identify specific situations that are likely to anger you and contract to tryout your skills in those situations. The goal is to make sure that you are fully able to use your skills whenever and wherever the need arises. You can also apply these skills to other negative emotions or distressing states (e.g., feeling anxious or depressed, coping with discomfort at the dentist\\'s office). Throughout CRCS you will have a variety of homework assignments to help yOll understand your anger and to develop and transfer cognitive and relaxation skills into your everyday life. Psychoeducalion and Skill BuHdmg Part of your counseling will be educational. In fact, you have already begun. You\\'re already learning a good deal about anger-what triggers it, how it is experienced and expressed, and its consequences. You are learning about different ways to approach reducing anger. Much of your learning wiII be very personal. You\\'ll be Assessment and Treatment Planning 23 learning about your anger, your experiences, and how you can do and feel something different. In addition to its psychoeducational component, CRCS involves five skill elements enhanced personal awareness, learning to relax, learning to change angry thoughts, rehearsal and transfer of skills, and maintenance and relapse prevention. Enhanced Personal Awareness Many angry individuals aren\\'t very aware of themselves and their anger. They often don\\'t know what triggers their anger, what they think and feel, or why they act as they do. However, if they understood themselves better, they would be in a better position to use the coping skills and strategies they already possess. They\\'d also more effectively apply the new skills developed during CRCS. Many parts of CRCS are designed to help you develop this enhanced awareness. You\\'re already becoming aware of yourself as you start to assess your anger, describe examples of your anger, complete questionnaires, and keep track of your anger on your Anger Log. This awareness will grow throughout the course of therapy. For example, you\\'ll continue to learn more and more about yourself as you keep track of anger responses on your log. You will notice when, what, where, and how you feel, think, and react. During relaxation training, you\\'ll learn a lot about how you feel, noticing areas of tension and areas that are calm and relaxed. During the cognitive portion of your work, you\\'ll become more aware of habitual patterns of angry thinking and how such thoughts influence you\\'re anger. During skill rehearsal within and between the sessions, you\\'ll become more aware of how you can use your thoughts, feelings, and knowledge of anger-provoking situations to trigger your cognitive and relaxation coping skills. In short, each component of CRCS will build knowledge of yourself and strengthen your abilities to cope. Relaxation You cannot be both angry and relaxed at the same time. Your therapist will show you a number of ways to relax and how to use this relaxation to combat anger. The first step will be to learn progressive muscle relaxation. This involves progressively tensing and releasing the various muscle groups in your body. For example, you may start with clenching your hands into tight fists, then bending your hands back at the wrists and tensing, and continuing this process, moving up your arms to your head and then down to your feet. Typically, progreSSive muscle relaxation takes about twenty to twenty-five minutes. After your therapist shows you how to do this skill, you will practice it at home every day. The more you practice, the faster and easier it will become. Your therapist will also introduce you to four quick relaxation coping skills: 1) relaxing without tensing muscles; 2) relaxing by visualizing a personal relaxation scene; 3) relaxing by taking three to five slow deep breaths; and 4) relaxing by repeating some cue word or phrase. These are skills that can instill a sense of relaxation within a few seconds and will be your front-line relaxation skills when coping with angry feelings. 24 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger Changing Angry Thinking People with anger problems often make bad situations worse by thinking about things in an \"angry\" way. For example, they might encounter a piece of equipment that is not working properly. Rather than seeing it as just an unfortunate, frustrating thing, they expect it to always work and feel that they shouldn\\'t have to put up with such junk. They may curse, calling the equipment and the people who maintain it names, complaining that this kind of thing always happens to them, and catastrophizing about how awful and terrible the breakdown is. This kind of thinking is often highly automatic, meaning that you may not even be aware that you\\'re thinking such thoughts. Nonetheless, thinking in these ways takes situations that are realistically negative (e.g., frustrating and disappointing) and turns them into angry, charged disasters. To deal with such thinking patterns, CRCS will help you identify and change your automatic anger-triggering thoughts. You won\\'t simply parrot new thoughts, but explore and challenge your old thoughts, until you come up with new ways of thinking that are believable and make sense to you. Rehearsal and Transfer Learning new skills is not enough. You need to use them in everyday life to combat anger. You have to know that they are reliable and there when you need them. A lot of this program is, therefore, devoted to practice. You will begin your practice within the sessions. Your therapist will have you practice your cognitive and relaxation skills by teaching you to visualize situations that make you angry. As you create the mental scene, you\\'ll feel some of the original anger all over again. You\\'ll pump the anger up as high as you can, and then initiate your cognitive and relaxation skills to lower those feelings of anger. In early sessions, your therapist will help you with this a lot, and the anger arousal genera ted by the scene will be moderate. As you get better and better at coping with your anger, the anger level of the scenes will be increased, and your therapist will assist you less. You will also have homework assignments that have you apply your skills outside the therapy session. You\\'ll record your efforts in an Angcr Log, and you and your therapist will discuss them, supporting your successes and troubleshooting any difficulties. This kind of practice within and betwecn sessions will help you become confident in your anger-management skills and know that they have transferred to your dayto- day life. Maintenance and Relapse Prevention Acquiring anger-management skills is an important part of the battle, but continuing to use them over time is also critically important. By the end of therapy, you will have worked hard and developed a number of ways to lower anger, but if you don\\'t continue to use these skills, you could return to your old angry ways. You and your therapist should anticipate and make plans for this possibility. For example, you may design plans to periodically review and practice your angermanagement skills. You may set various check-in points at which you report in Assessment and Treatment Planning 25 person, by phone, or in writing on your efforts to continue anger management. You may plan for specific booster sessions, say at two and six months after therapy, in which you review your efforts and address any difficulties. Also, you should make arrangements so that you know how to contact your therapist in the future should the need arise. These are just a few examples of the things that you may do to keep your focus on continuing to attend to anger and use your skills to manage anger over the long term. Duration of Treatment To expect the full benefit of CRCS, you should commit yourself to at least eight sessions after the assessment phase. However, if you have other issues that take time and attention (e.g., a crisis at work or a threatened divorce), you may need additional sessions. Also, some people find that even after they have learned to manage their anger pretty well, additional issues remain. For example, a person may have lowered his or her anger, but still not know how to deal with children when they misbehave or to communicate about difficult issues with a spouse. Additional sessions may be necessary to address these needed skills. So, eight sessions of CRCS are likely to be a minimum, and additional sessions may be needed to continue anger management or to address other important topics. Therapy is a safe place to bring up important, sensitive issues. You may find yourself wanting to discuss a variety of topics with your therapist. However, think carefully about what issues you bring up in therapy. It\\'s important for you to feel heard and understood, but ask yourself how bringing up these issues now will impact learning to manage your anger. Ask yourself if you have other people or resources where you can discuss these other issues. If you do, you may want to save your therapy time for anger reduction. Also, if you continually want to talk about other things, consider the possibility that you may be trying to avoid dealing with your anger. Sometimes people find it easier to talk about other, less pressing issues rather than face the difficulty of changing their anger. Talking about other things, important as they may be, will not likely make your anger go away. If you or your therapist find you pulling away from the central focus of therapy, you should discuss it openly. Then, either contract for another form of therapy or refocus and recommit to the tasks of CRCS. If you are in crisis, especially if you\\'re having suicidal thoughts or thoughts of harming others, then immediately discuss them with your therapist. If you have done or are doing things to hurt others, tell your therapist right away. Call before your next appointment if necessary, but talk to your therapist so that the two of you can take appropriate action to prevent harm to you or others. Be aware that your therapist is legally and ethically bound to take all reasonable measures to prevent further harm. 26 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger Other Things That Can Influence the Course of Therapy There are several key issues that can influence the course of anger-reduction therapy. If they are applicable to you, then think about them and talk them over with your therapist. Are you coming to therapy primarily to get someone (e.g., a spollse or employer) or some system (e.g., the workplace or court) off your back? Are you hoping therapy could prevent something negative from happening (e.g., a spouse leaving or being fired)? If this is the primc motivation for attending therapy, then anger reduction is not likely. Anger-reduction counseling is hard work and requires you to do many new things. You aren\\'t likely to really invest in therapy if you are motivated solely by external conditions. Should any of the above be the prime motivators for therapy, then you may want to rethink your commitment and potentially save yourself time, money, and frustration. YOll should have realistic goals about therapy. The goals of CRCS are anger reduction, not anger elimination. Quite simply, life will throw many difficult, frustrating things in your direction. Relationships don\\'t always go the way that we want them to, and they may have to change or end. Jobs may be lost through no fault of your own. Important goals and desires may not be reached, no matter how much you have tried. People who are close sometimes become ill, or even die. These are simply the realities of life, and mild to moderate negative feelings like anger, frustration, disappointment, hurt, and sadness are appropriate feelings to have. The point is that managing your anger won\\'t lead to an anger-free, positive world. However, if you have lowered your anger, you\\'ll be more effective at making hard decisions and coping with difficult situations. Moreover, your efforts to control anger will not always be supported by others. They may not care or may actually have an investment in your being angry. You should be entering this anger-reduction program for your reasons only. You should be in therapy because you don\\'t like your anger and its consequences. If others like you and treat you better for managing your anger, that\\'s an added benefit. However, it shouldn\\'t be an expectation. You should be in therapy primarily for your own reasons, not for the attention and approval of others. Anger often involves a great deal of externalization and blame. It may be easy for you to find fault and blame others for your anger and, to some extent, you\\'re correct. Others and outside events do contribute to your anger, but only to a degree. It\\'s true that often you can do little to control or change negative events. The only thing you may have any chance of controlling or changing is how you react to them. That\\'s what anger management in CRCS is all abollt, giving you the skills to recognize and lower anger using cognitive and relaxation coping skills. So, set aside your blame and begin the one thing you can reliably do something about-assessing and changing you. Our thoughts contribute mightily to our anger, yet they are often out of awareness and on a kind of automatic pilot. The cognitive portion of CRCS will have you Assessment and Treatment Planning 27 looking at these automatic thought processes and assessing their validity. You\\'ll be exploring beliefs, assumptions, and ways of seeing things that trigger anger. This isn\\'t easy. When our beliefs and assumptions are scrutinized, we often fight back and defend them, whether they make sense or not. It often feels like we\\'re being told that we are wrong. Resist the temptation to fight back. Be willing to look inside and see things in a different light. Try out new ways of thinking and see how they fit. You can always go back to your old ways of thinking, but during the next few weeks try looking at the world through the new lens this program offers. Concurrent Medication Treatment As noted in the introduction, certain drugs (particularly the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor [SSRI] type of antidepressants) help some people with anger problems. You and your therapist should discuss the possible benefits of medication and a referral for a medication evaluation. If the two of you think medication is worth exploring, your therapist will likely refer you to a psychiatrist with whom he or she regularly consults on cases such as yours. Questions and Concerns If you don\\'t understand something in the session, something about treatment, or the nature of homework, by all means ask your therapist to clarify the point. You aren\\'t likely to benefit from therapy if you don\\'t fully understand things. You and your therapist are a team, and each of you should work with the other to clarify issues and clear up misunderstandings. Also, if you have questions that have not been addressed during the session, raise them before the session is over and get answers to them. Homework The crucial importance of homework in CRCS was described in the introduction. Between now and your next session, you should complete the following homework assignments: 1. Fill out the Anger Situation(s), and the Anger Symptom(s) (copies at the end of this session); your therapist may also ask you to complete the State-Trait Anger Inventory, as well. 2. Begin self-monitoring your anger using Anger Log I (copies at the end of this session). 3. Complete any other forms, contracts, and!or releases of information you and your therapist discussed. 28 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger 4. Return questionnaires, Anger Log I, and any forms to your therapist as agreed. 5. Read the introduction and sessions 1 and 2 from this manual if you have not already done so, and review them if you have. After discussing homework, you should do three things prior to leaving the session. First, if anything is unclear, ask questions and clarify the issues. Second, summarize your understanding of the homework and check to make sure that you have understood it correctly. Third, if your therapist doesn\\'t do it for you, write down other assignments not outlined in this book. Be as specific and concrete as you can be in writing them down so that they will be clear to you later. Assessment and Treatment Planning 29 Ii Ii i Anger Situation Instructions: Please describe, in detail, the one ongoing situation that creates the greatest feelings of anger for you. By ongoing, it is meant that the situation occurs fairly often, say at least once a month or more. Pick out the most angering, ongoing situation. Be very specific.

The initial step is developing effective relaxation imagery by creating a mental picture of a time and place where you felt completely calm and peacefuL Step 2 is progressive relaxation training, where YOll tense and release specific muscle groups. The Importance of Relaxation Training It takes two things to get angry-physical tension or stress plus anger-triggering thoughts. Half the anger battle can be won by simply learning to relax the physical and emotional tension that develops in provocative situations. If you can relax your body and keep it relaxed, it\\'s almost impossible to get or stay angry. Combating stress using the skills you\\'re learning can help you calm down, think straight, and handle the situation in an effective, positive way. The goal is to be so good at relaxing that you can let go of tension any time, anywhere, in thirty seconds or less. Research has shown that relaxation training alone call make a big dent in your anger problem. It really works. But it\\'s going to take commitment on your part to keep practicing your relaxation skills until they feel like second nature. Relaxation Image Construction If you haven\\'t already done so with your therapist, this is a good time to develop a personal relaxation image. Right nmv, think back to a time when you were really relaxed, a time when you were calm and peacefuL It could be at the beach, mountains, meadows, or your childhood bedroom. Anchor your memory of this place to an exact instant in time. Try to see it as it was at that moment-the shapes and colors, the quality of life. Notice the sounds in this place-birds or waves or babbling water. Feel the temperature of this place-is it cool or warm? Feel the textures of whatever you touch. Was there any important or identifying sense of motion like the gentle rocking of a boat or a breeze pushing against your face? Now feel the emotions of this place. Notice the feelings of safety or calmness or gentle longing that it evokes in you. Let yourself be aware of the special qualities of the place-what you see or hear or feel-that give you the greatest sense of peace, calmness, or tranquillity. What follows are two example relaxation scenes to give you an idea of how to develop yours. Relaxation scene 1. It is that day about three weeks ago when you and your brother were out on the lake, fishing (general setting detail). It is one of those perfect days. Your brother always makes you laugh and feel good (general emotional detail). You\\'ve been fishing most of the morning and now have moved over into Jayne\\'s Cove. The two of you have anchored the boat about seventy-five yards off shore. You\\'re laying crossways on the seat of the boat. You aren\\'t talking but can sort of feel you brother\\'s presence as you lay on your back with your hat covering your face. You have your eyes closed (more speCifiC setting details), but there is warm orange light coming through your hat and onto your face (visual and temperature detail). You can just feel that early fall warmth on your body, not too hot but warm. The boat is rocking gently with the slight breeze. It\\'s like you are gently swaying in a hammock (kinesthetic detail). You can hear the water lapping quietly against the side of the boat and could hear the occasional sound of a gull somewhere overhead (auditory detail). You\\'re warm, but not hot, and totally relaxed (temperature and emotional detail). You have that sense of being totally at peace with the world. You\\'re thinking that if you died right then everything would be right with the world (more emotional detail). Relaxation scene 2. It\\'s that time many years ago, the summer that you were eleven, and you and your cousin, Mary, were visiting your grandparents\\' farm in rural Georgia (general setting detail). You loved it there, always feeling free and truly loved by your grandparents (general emotional detail). You and your cousin were up in the loft of the bam. She was on your right about an arm\\'s length away, and the two of you were talking. You were laying there in the loose hay, looking out through the open doors onto the area your grandfather had recently plowed up. You looked across a plowed filed to the pasture and then to the pine trees beyond (more speCifiC setting detail). You can smell the field, dry and mildly dusty smelling (olfactory detail). The air is warm and very still (temperature detail). It is starting to rain. Both of you are dry, but can hear the rain gently coming down on the metal roof (auditory detail). Best of all, the rain is making that wonderful\"wet earth\" smell come up from the ground just out back (more olfactory detail). You just love that smell. Everything is still, peaceful, and relaxed as you rest there in the bam with your cousin at your grandparents\\'. 34 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger As you may have noticed, the first scene is from the relatively recent past, whereas the second is from the distant past. Both types of scenes are fine. The only requirements are that they be clear, concrete, easily visualized, and relaxing. You may also have noticed that the scenes are constructed using various sense modalities. There\\'s visual imagery, auditory (sounds), kinesthetic (touch), and even olfactory (sense of smell) detail. There\\'s also material about the emotional climate of the scene-how it really felt to be alive at that moment. In the space provided on the next page, write out your personal relaxation scene using as much sensory and emotional detail as possible. Paint yourself an emotional picture of relaxation, like a snapshot of a very calm moment in your life. Deep Breathing and Progressive Relaxation Training Progressive relaxation training was developed by a Chicago physician named Edmund Jacobson in the 1920s. It has survived into modern times as a key relaxation exercise for a simple reason-it\\'s extraordinarily effective. Progressive relaxation training is a simple process that involves systematically tensing and releasing the muscles of the body. Muscles become more relaxed after they have been tensed, and most people experience a deep sense of calm after a few minutes of progressive relaxation training. First, settle yourself comfortably in a chair with your arms and legs uncrossed. When you\\'ve memorized the sequence, you can do it with your eyes closed. For now, just read each step, do it, and continue on to the next one. Start to relax by taking three or four deep breaths. When you inhale, push the air way down into your belly, hold it for a moment, and then exhale. As you let go of the breath, try to let your whole body relax. Once you\\'ve completed the three or four deep breaths, it\\'s time to start tensing and releasing the muscle groups. Tense for about seven to ten seconds and focus on the feelings of tension. Then, quietly release the muscles and spend about thirty seconds noticing and increasing the feeling of relaxation. Then, move to the next muscle group. Begin with your hands. Tense both hands into tight fists and hold them that way for seven to ten seconds. Feel the tension around your fingers and knuckles. As you relax, notice how the tension flows out. Also notice what it feels like for your hands to be relaxed. Do they tingle or twitch? Is there a feeling of heaviness or warmth? Now focus on your forearms, bending your hands back at the wrists like you were pushing a heavy object away. Hold the tension for seven to ten seconds. Feel that tension; notice what it\\'s like. Now release the forearms and relax. Again, take the time to notice what relaxation feels like in your forearms. Now work on your upper arms by bending them at the elbows and tightening up in a \"Charles Atlas\" pose. Hold it for seven to ten seconds and then relax, taking the time to notice what your arms feel like as they let go of tension and become truly relaxed. Relaxation Skills 35 ill I III Relaxation Scene Use visual, auditory, kinesthetic, olfactory, and emotional details that make the scene rich and alive and peacefuL 36 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger Now shrug your shoulders, like you were trying to bury your shoulder blades in your ears. Hold seven to ten seconds and release. Notice the feelings of relaxation in your neck and shoulder area. Take a moment to review the muscles you have just relaxed. Let them relax a little more, but without tensing them. Imagine a wave or a flow of relaxation soaking in around your shoulders.... Now let that wave of relaxation flow down through the biceps ... loosening and relaxing the biceps and upper arms.... Let that flow of relaxation move on down through the forearms ... loosening and relaxing the forearms.... Now let that relaxation flow into your hands and fingers . and let the remaining tensions drain right out through the ends of your fingers . Take a moment to enjoy the feelings of relaxation you\\'re creating, feelings you can later use to Imver anger. Now continue tensing and relaxing by focusing on your forehead. Either frown or lift your eyebrows upward, holding the tension for seven to ten seconds. After the release of tension in the forehead, notice what it feels like for your forehead to be deeply relaxed. Now focus on the tension in your eyes and the bridge of your nose by squinting very tightly, as if you had just walked out of a dark room into the bright sun. Hold for seven to ten seconds and then relax. Notice what it feels like for your eyes to let go of tension. Now focus on your cheeks and jaw by drawing your mouth back into a wide grin. Really try to smile ear to ear. Hold for seven to ten seconds and let go. Notice how your cheeks and jaw feel when truly relaxed. Now feel the tension in your mouth by pressing your lips together firmly. Hold seven to ten seconds and let go. Notice the relaxed feelings after the release. Relax the back of your neck by bending your neck downward and backward firmly for about ten seconds. Then, notice the muscles letting go. Now relax the front of your neck by bending your head forward, trying to touch your chin to your chest. Hold it for seven to ten seconds and release. Notice what it feels like for your neck to relax. Take a moment now to relax these same muscles again, but without tensing them. Imagine your wave or flow of relaxation soaking into your forehead, then slowly moving down to your eyes, cheeks, and jaw.... Feel the wave of relaxation release any remaining tension in your mouth and lips.... Now feel it wash into your neck and release all tension there. J~elax your chest and upper back by taking a deep breath and holding it, then exhaling. Take a moment to feel the sensation of release in your chest area. Now gently arch your back, being careful not to strain. Hold it for seven to ten seconds and release, noticing the feelings of relaxation in your middle and lower back. Focus on your stomach by pushing it out against a hard wall. Hold it for seven to ten seconds, and notice how it feels when your stomach begins to deeply relax. Again, take a moment to review the muscle groups you\\'ve just relaxed, and let them relax a little more, but without tensing each one. Imagine that wave of relaxation continuing to flow down your body, relaxing your chest and upper back ... then moving down to your middle and lower back.... Feel it loosening and relaxing your stomach, flowing throughout your entire abdominal area. Relaxation Skills 37 Now to your lower body. Relax your hips and buttocks by clenching the buttocks together firmly. Hold for seven to ten seconds and release. Notice what it feels like for your hips to deeply relax. Now deal with tension in your thighs by lifting your feet a couple of inches off the floor and clenching your thighs. Hold for seven to ten seconds and release. Notice how your thighs feel when they relax. Release tension in your shins by lifting your feet several inches off the floor and trying to touch your toes to your knee caps. Hold this pose for seven to ten seconds and let go. Try to be aware of how your shins feel when they release tension. Relax your calves by pointing your toes down and away. Hold seven to ten seconds and release. Take the time to be aware of relaxation in your calves. Again, review the muscles you\\'ve just relaxed. Allow that wave or flow of relaxation to soak into your hips and buttocks, moving slowly down to your thighs ... past your knees through your shins ... and calves. Feel the muscles of your legs loosening and relaxing ... let the remaining tensions drain right out the end of your toes. How to Practice Relaxation on a Daily Basis For each practice session, set aside about thirty minutes, during which you\\'ll not be interrupted. You may not need the full thirty minutes, but you don\\'t want to be rushed and have one eye on the clock. Pick a time that is convenient for you. However, do not practice relaxation within the last hour before you go to bed. Many people get a kind of second wind after relaxing, and you don\\'t want that just when you\\'re trying to go to sleep. Generally, sitting in a comfortable chair works well. Always start with four or five slow, deep breaths. If you\\'re having any difficulty taking deep breaths into your abdomen, try this technique: With one hand on your abdomen (just above the belt line) and the other on your chest, breathe in such a way that the hand on your chest moves little or not at all, while the one on your abdomen goes up and down with the breath. If you still have difficulty doing deep, abdominal breathing, push on your abdomen with your hand. Breathe so the air seems directed to where you\\'re pushing with your hand, forcing it to rise. After the deep breaths, tense and release key muscle groups as you learned in the progressive relaxation training session. An abbreviated reminder of the progressive relaxation sequence appears on a page called Relaxation Practice Summary at the end of this session. When you\\'ve completed the process of tensing and releasing your muscles, tum on your personal relaxation image one or more times. Let yourself really be there and reexperience that situation and the relaxation that goes with it. Hold the image for about a minute, then erase and repeat it. The last step in your relaxation practice session should be to count backwards from 5 to 1, trying to become more alert as you do so. Shake your arms and legs gently on 4, open your eyes on 2, and be alert but refreshed and calm on 1. This little countdown helps bring you back to the real world and acts as a transition out of the relaxation process. 38 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger Homework 1. Thi~ week you\\'ll switch to using Anger Log II (that includes a column for thoughts). As you have before, keep track of all the anger situations that arise each day, and write in your log any that are greater than 40 on the lOO-point scale of anger arousal. Be sure to make at least one anger entry per day (even if nothing that day was more than 40 on the scale). When making an anger entry, try to note each significant anger-triggering thought, as well as the emotional and physiological reactions that you experienced. This information may be very important in subsequent therapy sessions. The more details you give, the more help your therapist can likely provide to you. 2. IJractice progressive relaxation training, deep breathing, and using your relaxation image at least five of the next seven days. Daily practice is crucial because these skilJs need multiple rehearsals to be really useful in anger management. They need to be overlearned, like driving a car or riding a bicycle, so you can do them without thinking. Record each practice session in the Relaxation Log (chart found at the end of this session). Preview of Session 3 In session 3 you will work on three new relaxation skills: breathing-cued relaxation, cue-controlled relaxation, i:md relaxation without tension. Breathing-cued relaxation is something you\\'re already starting to learn. It\\'s the deep breathing exercise you do before progressive relaxation, where you push the air way down into your abdomen. You focus all your attention on your belly, sending the ajr deep down to fill it. Breathing-cued relaxation stretches your diaphragm. A relaxed diaphragm sends a message to your brain that all is well and that there\\'s nothing to get upset about. Cue-controlled relaxation pairs a cue word or a phrase, such as \"relax,\" \"peace,\" or \"calm,\" with a deep diaphragmatic breath. You learn to relax your whole body by saying the cue word slowly, possibly as you exhale. Relaxation without tension involves relaxing your body using the same muscle sequence you learned in progressive relaxation training. But this time you relax without tensing the muscles first. You focus on a particular muscle group (your arms, for example) and relax away any tension you might feel there. Noticing and relaxing tension in specific muscle areas is an important skill because it will help you let go of muscle stress during anger-provoking situations. You\\'ve already had a preview of this when you let that flow of relaxation wash through an area after tensing several muscles. Combined Relaxation Skills In session 3 you\\'ll learn to use key relaxation skills in combination. Typically, you\\'ll start with breathing-cued relaxation, followed by relaxation without tension. Relaxation Skills 39 Then you\\'ll shift to relaxation imagery and cue-controlled relaxation. Another round of relaxation imagery might follow, as well as breathing-cued and cuecontrolled relaxation practice. You\\'ll learn to shift easily from one relaxation technique to another. Over time, you\\'ll learn what method or methods work best for you. With practice, you\\'ll have relaxation tools to calm you down and help you think clearer and behave in the ways you want to. 40 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger moe C::,...... .JC::: I; OJ U (l) r;:I .....

Since you cannot be very angry and relaxed at the same time, you will be learning ways of relaxing quickly and easily so you can relax and reduce tension and anger. Relaxation is a skill, and like any skill, it becomes better and easier with practice. The first step is practicing at horne the skills you learned in the session. For each practice session, set aside about thirty minutes in which you wil! not be interrupted. You may not need the full thirty minutes, but you don\\'t want to feel rushed with one eye on the clock. Pick a time that is convenient for you. However, do not practice relaxation within the last hour before you go to bed. Many people get a kind of second wind after relaxing, and you don\\'t want that just when you\\'re trying to go to sleep. Pick a place that is quiet and comfortable, but not so comfortable that you go to sleep. Generally, sitting in a comfortable chair works well. Follow the general sequence below. With one hand on your abdomen (just above the belt line) and the other on your chest, breathe in such a way that the hand on your chest moves little or not at all, while the one on your abdomen goes up and down with the breath. If you have difficulty doing deep, abdominal breathing, push on your abdomen \\'NUh vour hand. Breathe so the air seems directed to where vou are push- , J ing with your handt forcing it to rise. 1. Stal\\'t \\'with fall I\\' to five slow deep breaths. With one hand on your abdomen Gust above the belt line) and the other on your chest, breathe in such a way that the hand on your chest moves little or not at all, while the one on your abdomen goes up and down with the breath. If you have difficulty doing deep, abdominal breathing, push on your abdomen with your hand. Breathe so the air seems directed to where you are pushing with your hand, forcing it to rise. 2. Tense and release nlUscles (tense for about ten seconds focusing on the tension and then relax for about 20~30 seconds, focusing on the feelings of relaxa~ tion, and then go to the next muscle group). Below is the order and means of tensing the muscles. Hands, by clenching them into a fist Forearms, by bending them at the wrist and pushing away hard Upper armst by bending them at the elbows and fleXing them Shoulders; by shrugging them mc\\'uieu\\' sholliders, upper arms, forearms, and hands \\'ll\\'itllOut tensing) Foreheadt by frowning or raising eyebrows (whichever works best for you) Eyes and bridge of noset by squinting eyes tightly Cheeks and jaws, by grinning ear to ear Mouth and lips, by pressing lips together firmly Back of neck, by pressing backwards and downward firmly Relaxation Skills 43 Front of neck, by pressing chin forward and downward (Review head and neck muscles without tensing them) Chest and upper back, by taking a deep breath and holding it then exhaling Middle and lower back, by arching back Stomach, by pushing it out into a hard wall (Review chest, back and stomach without tensing) Hips and buttocks, by clenching the buttocks together firmly Thighs, by lifting feet from floor and clenching thighs firmly Shins, by trying to touch toes to knees Calves, by pointing feet down and away (Review legs and lower body without tensing) 3. Turn on personal relaxation image one or more times. Vividly imagine your personal relaxation scene. Construct it as quickly as possible, focusing on shapes and colors, sounds, and physical sensations. Pay particular attention to what makes you feel really peaceful and safe in this scene. Hold the image for about a minute, then erase and repeat. 4. Count backwards from five to one and come to alertness. 44 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger Relaxation Coping Skills Agenda The agenda for session 3 includes learning three new relaxation skills: breathingcued relaxation, cue-controlled relaxation, and relaxation without tension. You\\'ve already had a preview of breathing-cued relaxation in session 2. This is deep, diaphragmatic breathing, where you push the breath way down into your abdomen. Cue-controlled rel,lxation is a very important skill. It allows you to relax with extraordinary swiftness, releasing tension even during the most provocative anger situations. The essenCe of the technique is to repeat to yourself a cue word, such as \"peace,\" \"relax,\" or \"let go\" while exhaling and simultaneously releasing tension in the major muscle groups of your body. In relaxation without tension, you will relax your muscles following the same sequence as in progressive relaxation. This time, however, you won\\'t start by tensing the muscle. You\\'ll focus on a key muscle group, notice any tension, and simply relax it away. It\\'s like doing those muscle reviews with the wave of relaxation in session 2. The above three skills will later be combined with the additional element of relaxation imagery. You will practice breathing-cued relaxation, cue-controlled relaxation, relaxation without tension, and relaxation imagery in a sequence that will create proficiency with the specific skills, as well as teach you how to transition quickly between them. Breathing-Cued Relaxation Start by putting one hand over your chest and the other over your abdomen, just above your belt line. Try taking a deep breath, way down into your belly. Really try to stretch your diaphragm. As you breathe in, the hand on your abdomen should rise, while the hand on your chest remains relatively still. Focus all your attention on your belly-send your breath deep down to fill it. Let your breath push and relax your abdomen. Each breath, as it stretches your diaphragm, sends a message to your brain that all is well, there\\'s nothing to worry about. Breathing-cued relaxation helps you release tension almost instantly. As you practice, just keep taking slow, deep breaths. Only breathe when you feel the need; don\\'t rush it and hyperventilate. Practice breathing-eued relaxation for a minimum of eight to ten breaths. Do more if you\\'re having difficulty making the hand at your belt line rise. Cue-Controlled Relaxation Cue-controlled relaxation gives you the tools to relax your entire body in a minute or less. Through this exercise you will eventually pair a cue word or a phrase with deep relaxation and diaphragmatic breathing. Now it\\'s time to select a word or phrase that will cue deep relaxation each time you repeat it. The word could be \"relax\" or \"letting go\" or \"calm control\" or \"peace.\" It might be a color, such as \"green,\" or a feeling, such as \"love.\" Cue words are often a single syllable, such as \"one\" or \"om.\" Right now say your cue word slowly to yourself, and each time you hear it, let yourself relax a little more. Keep repeating the cue word or phrase with approximately ten seconds between repetitions. Continue until you\\'ve said the cue word a total of ten times. Now time your cue word so you say it each time you exhale. Breathe out slowly and regularly, saying the cue word with each exhalation. Try to relax a little more each time you say the cue word to yourself.... Let go and relax each time you say it ... breathing slowly and regularly, saying your cue word, and releasing all tension. After a minute or so of practice, discontinue saying the word and just take a moment to enjoy the feelings of relaxation that you are creating for yourself. Relaxation Without Tension Now you\\'re going to relax the major muscle groups in the exact same sequence you did with progressive relaxation training. But this time you\\'re not going to tighten anything. Instead you\\'ll scan each major muscle group for tension and relax away any tightness noticed in the target area. The key phrase you\\'ll use as you deal with tension in each muscle group is, \"Notice and relax.\" If you need a reminder of the relaxation sequence, use the instructions in the Relaxation Practice Summary at the end of session 2. Here\\'s an example of how you might talk yourself through the relaxation process using relaxation without tension. Focus on your hands and notice any tension you may feel there. Now relax away the tension. Just let it go. Notice and relax the tension. Feel the difference as you relax your hands.... Now focus on your forearms and notice any tension that might exist there. Relax away the tension. Release it. Notice and relax the tension, 46 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger let it go. Feel the difference as you relax your forearms.... Now turn your attention to your upper arms. Notice and relax away the tension. Let it go. Let the tension drain away_ Feel the difference as you relax your upper arms.... Right now, continue working your way down the sequence in the Relaxation Practice Summary, using the instructions and key phrases modeled above. Combined Relaxation Skills Now you can learn to use the four key relaxation skills in combination: breathingcued relaxation, cue-controlled relaxation, relaxation without tension, and relaxation imagery. The following sequence can be used for a combined relaxation practice. You should allocate between one and three minutes for each particular relaxation exercise. Breathing-cued relaxation Relaxation without tension Relaxation imagery Cue-controlled relaxation Relaxation imagery Breathing-cued relaxation Cue-controlled relaxation Keep repeating these relaxation exercises, using approximately the same sequence, for around fifteen minutes. When you\\'re finished, count backwards from 5 to 1 (becoming more alert as you do so), just as you learned in the homework from last session. Homework 1. Continue self-monitoring anger episodes using Anger Log II. You\\'ll find a fresh copy at the end of this session. 2. Practice the combined relaxation sequence once per day (Le., relaxation without tension, relaxation imagery, cue-controlled relaxation, and breathingcued relaxation). This should be done in the quiet of your home, just as progressive relaxation was done last week. Relaxation practice will typically take about ten to fifteen minutes, but allow plenty of time so you won\\'t feel hurried. You should end up practicing each of the relaxation exercises multiple times. Mix up the order if you want to, but be sure to get plenty of practice with each technique. Each practice session should be noted in your relaxation log, a new copy of which is also provided at the end of this session. Relaxation Coping Skills 47 3. At least once per day (more often if possible), practice one of your new relaxation coping skills in a nonstressful, everyday circumstance (e.g., watching TV, waiting for a friend at lunch, riding the bus, etc.). These efforts should also be recorded in your Relaxation Log. The goal here is to be able to initiate relaxation coping skills in real life settings. If you\\'re wondering whether you should try to apply relaxation coping skills when you\\'re angry or stressed, the answer is a cautious \"yes.\" The caution is that your skills are not yet fully developed and may not always succeed in lowering anger. You\\'re going to get a whole lot more practice in coming sessions, so your ability to relax in the face of provocation is slowly going to build over time. So, if you\\'re inclined to try, go ahead and experiment using relaxation skills when you\\'re angry, but don\\'t be discouraged if it doesn\\'t yet work. You\\'ll get results soon enough. Make notes on your efforts to relax in the face of anger and talk to your therapist about the expereince. 4. This week you\\'ll need to identify and make notes on two occasions where you were anticipating or ruminating about an anger situation that was likely, but had not yet happened. For example, anticipating dealing with parents, a boss, or coworkers about a tense issue, waiting for a roommate or a partner to come home so that an issue could be dealt with, or knowing that something upsetting was about to happen at work. Develop as many details as possible about these two anger occasions. What\\'s the setting and situation? What exactly are people saying and doing? What are you thinking? Feeling? What sensations do you experience inside your body? These two anger occasions should rate no more than moderate anger-approximately 50 to 60 on the 100-point anger scale. These scenes will get further attention in homework following session 4. Sketch out the details of these two scenes in the worksheet on the next page. Preview of Session 4 In session 4 you will learn about the ABC model of emotion, where A (an event) leads to B (your thought, interpretation, or assumption about the event), which in turn leads to C (your emotional and behavioral reactions). Emotion.c; such as anger are not caused by events, but by your thinking about the event. Your thoughts can literally create your anger by labeling other people\\'s behavior as wrong, bad, or unjust. Several experiments will help you begin to recognize how easily your feelings can be influenced by your thinking. To get a hint of how powerfully your mind influences your feelings, try this experiment: First, rate on the 0 to 100 point anger scale how angry you feel at this exact moment. Once you have the rating, spend a few moments thinking about a recent event that pushed your buttons. Think about what the person said or did. Visualize it. Remember how wrong, or unfair, or unjust the behavior seemed to you. Think about how the behavior affected you-the inconvenience or problems it caused, the upsetting feelings. After spending three or four minutes immersed in memories of the anger episode, re-rate how angry you feel (on the 100-point scale). 48 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger Anticipatory Anger Scenes Include details about the situation, as well as what might be said and done. Describe your thoughts, feelings, and physiological reactions as you anticipate the anger situation. Anticipatory Anger Situation 1 Anticipatory Anger Situation 2 Relaxation Coping Skills 49 If you\\'re like most people, that anger rating has likely gone up. The sole source of your increased anger is your thoughts. Nothing is happening in the moment; you\\'ve gotten riled up because you are thinking about how badly someone else behaved. Anger Distortions Once you understand the role your thoughts play in generating anger, you\\'ll explore six types of anger distortions that are major triggers for upset. They are: Magnifying/Catastrophizing. This is the tendency to make every problem bigger and worse than it really is. Things become horrible, terrible, crappy, end-of-the-worldish. You zero in on the negative, painful aspects of a situation, while failing to notice things that are tolerable or even good. Overgeneralization. You tend to exaggerate and go beyond the facts of a situation or problem. There\\'s a tendency to use words like \"all,\" \"always,\" \"every,\" and \"never.\" Demanding/Commanding. Here you have a strict set of rules about how people should and should not act. People who behave according to the rules are right, and those who break the rules are wrong and bad. Inflammatory/Global Labeling. Global labels make sweeping, negative judgments. You make yourself angry using labels such as \"stupid,\" \"selfish,\" \"asshole,\" \"jerk,\" \"loser,\" \"liar,\" and so on. You respond angrily to the extra meaning of the label. Misattribution/Single Explanations. Misattribution is mind reading. When people hurt or annoy you, it\\'s easy to imagine that it was deliberate and meant to upset you. You assume you know others\\' true motives. You respond as if your assumptions are true, whether they are or not. Blaming. The key belief underlying blaming is that your pain is someone else\\'s responsibility. When you blame, you perceive that others are deliberately doing bad things; they are doing it to you. Whatever pain you feel, whatever hurt or loss, it\\'s the fault of others. This then justifies your anger without you having to look at your part in things. In session 4 you\\'ll learn to recognize anger distortions through the use of your Anger Logs. For each anger event you\\'ll circle the key anger-triggering thought, and right next to it, the anger distortion it represents. The skill of recognizing and changing anger distortions will be critical for long-term anger management. 50 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger o ~;2 ]6 ~.8 Q) r.:: e=::: :G 1\"\\'-\" , \\'\\' \\' ~ ~ , , ; C) 0 ...J ~ (I) C) c:  ..IJ..\\'i ..cco, ::l, 0 ..c ft:; .8 .... r.:: .:..l. {J5 r -,,-,-,- -   -, -,-  -  -  - ,- ,, -  \\', Ci E; 1=[ \\'I Ci ....... 1 ttl 0\\'- \\' Relaxation Coping Skills 51 Relaxation Log Instructions: Put a check mark under all relaxation exercises completed on each date. Progressive BreathingCueRelaxation Relaxation Relaxation Cued Controlled Without Date Training Imagery Relaxation Relaxation Tension I I -,-~ I i II I : 52 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger Cognitive Restructuring Agenda Session 4 introduces the ABC model of emotion. It explores the powerful role that thoughts play in anger production. The session continues with an exploration of the six main cognitive distortions that often influence anger experiences. You\\'ll practice recognizing and labeling distortions in your Anger Log. The Importance of Homework Doing work outside the session, including your homework, is essential for successful anger management. Unless you find time for practicing, you won\\'t be able to learn these new anger-management skills. Nothing will change. Your anger will stay on a hair trigger. You\\'re reading this book and working on the anger-management program because you want things to be different. If you put in the practice, there\\'s a very good chance they will change. But without daily practice, the new skills simply won\\'t get learned. You need to commit yourself to doing the home practice a minimum of five out of seven days. So far, homework has primilfily focused on mastering relaxation skills. But after this session, you will also be focusing on cognitive controL That is, you\\'ll be learning to identify anger-triggering thoughts and replacing them with new COpil1g thoughts. The upshot is that you\\'ll have even more homework to do. From here on it\\'ll take a little more effort, but the good news is that the cognitive control skills will give you tremendously effective tools to moderate your anger. If you\\'re having trouble completing the homework (practicing relaxation five out of seven days and keeping records in your Anger Log), then YOll need to find out what\\'s getting in the way. A frequently expressed reason for not doing relaxation homework is falling asleep. If this happens to you, find another time and/or a less comfortable environment to practice your relaxation. For example, you could switch from relaxing in bed at 9 P.M. to sitting in a straight-backed chair at 5:30 to 6:00 PM. A common misconception that can limit relaxation practice is thinking you should only relax when you\\'re stressed and tense. This isn\\'t completely accurate. It\\'s true that you can practice breathing-cued relaxation when stressed and get some benefit. However, relaxation is a skill, and so to become really competent you need to practice nearly every day, whether stressed or not. People often complain that important commitments keep them from spending the time to do relaxation practice. There\\'s no doubt you have a busy life, and you\\'re probably juggling multiple commitments. But you started the anger management program for a reason. Think about that reason right now. In the space below, write in brief descriptions of how anger has affected you in each area. 1. How anger has affected my work relationships: 2. How anger has affected my relationships with my family (parents, siblings, extended family): _ 3. How anger has affected my marriage/romantic relationships: _ 4. How anger has affected my friendships (both in terms of losing friends and straining relationships): _ 5. How my anger has harmed others (list the names of all the people your anger has hurt): _ 6. Last but not least, how your anger has hurt you (maybe led to physical injury, health problems, made you feel embarrassed, guilty, or stupid, or led you to feel bad in other ways): _ 54 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger If you have completed this exercise, you\\'re very clear on what anger has cost you. Although you have multiple commitments in your life, lowering your anger may be among the most important. If you can\\'t make your homework and practice sessions a high priority, you should probably stop the program at this time and wait until you really can make a commitment. Not much will be gained from showing up to sessions yet doing only minimal practice. If you choose to continue the program, do it with a clear resolve that you\\'ll do your homework each day. Misconceptions About Change Some people think that behavior patterns can be changed through insight or simply talking about the problem. This is rarely true. To illustrate, think about a time in the past when you really wanted to change your anger. Did you promise yourself or others that you were going to change? Did you start making a few efforts toward acting differently? What happened? Did any lasting change occur? lf your anger problem continued despite your desire to change, one of two things may have influenced the outcome. First, you may have been counting on others to do the changing and therefore didn\\'t take full responsibility for the effort you would have to make. Second, you simply may not have sustained the efforts you had started. Changing anger is like changing any behavior-it\\'s hard work. If it were easy, you would already have done it. You wouldn\\'t need to be doing this program. Successful anger management isn\\'t like a New Year\\'s resolution. It has to be followed through with ongoing resolve and effort. In many ways anger reduction is similar to weight loss. Like the dieter, you have to engage in behaviors that lose and keep off the weight of anger. It can certainly be done, but it\\'s hard work. Learning something nev.\\' is never easy. Think back when you tried to learn a foreign language, or took up a new sport, or got interested in a new craft. How did you do it? The first thing was probably getting some lessons or assistance. That\\'s what this program is all about (i.e., getting training in the skills necessary for anger reduction). But like any ne\\\\\", task, it takes practice to really improve. You have to be willing to give up some things and make time for practice, just as you have in the past with other new skills. The ABC Model of Emotion When you get swept up in anger, it seems as though someone or something is making you feel that way. They are causing your anger. But what really happens is that an event starts you thinking about how bad or unjust a situation is, how someone has harmed or taken advantage of you. It\\'s the thought that sets off your anger. In your mind, you label someone\\'s behavior as wrong. They\\'ve deliberately caused you pain. It is these assumptions and interpretations of the event that trigger your feelings. In the ABC model of emotion, A is the activating event. B is your thoughts, assumptions, or interpretations of the event. And C is your emotional reaction Cognitive Restructuring 55 (anger). Events don\\'t cause your anger. You can\\'t get angry without the intervention of your thoughts. Consider this example. You\\'re walking along the beach in Hawaii and a coconut falls on your head. Your emotional reaction will be to feel startled and upset at the sudden pain. But suppose you look up into the palm tree and see a boy clinging to the upper fronds, throwing coconuts at passersby. Now you\\'re going to be angry. This isn\\'t an accident; someone is deliberately trying to hurt you. It\\'s the same pain but a different interpretation, and the emotion is very different-you\\'re angry. In the ABC model we learn not to blame events for our feelings. Instead we start to listen to our inner monologue, the beliefs, assumptions, and interpretations with which we try to make sense of the world. It\\'s this continual process of trying to understand and interpret our experience that leads to our emotions. When we interpret an event as dangerous, we feel frightened. When we interpret an event as a loss, we feel sad. And when we interpret an event as someone\\'s deliberate effort to inflict harm on us, we feel angry. Remember, the event itself doesn\\'t cause emotion. We only start to feel something when we\\'ve decided what the event means. Exploring the ABC Model Right now, you can do a little experiment to learn more about how thoughts influence your feelings. Imagine a situation where you have suffered a romantic rejection. After dating for a number of months, your partner tells you that the chemistry feels wrong and describes feeling that something is missing in the relationship. Your partner conveys appreciation for you and speaks fondly of things enjoyed during your months together. As you listen, you\\'re thinking about the lovely times that are over and about the many things you\\'ll miss. You tell yourself that it\\'ll be a cold day in hell before someone like this comes into your life again. You start to ponder some of your failures and limitations as a person that may have affected the relationship. This was a special person, a good relationship, and now it\\'s lost because of your mistakes. Life is empty, meaningless without him or her. And it\\'s all your fault. If you hadn\\'t screwed things up, maybe you\\'d still be together. Maybe he or she is better off without you. While you were imagining this scenario, what did you feel? How strong was that feeling on an emotion scale from 0 to 100? On a scrap of paper, write down the feeling and the rating. Now imagine the same situation: Your partner tells you the chemistry is wrong, there is something missing in the relationship. He or she appreciates you and remembers many good times but doesn\\'t feel able to get closer. As you listen, you tell yourself that this is bullshit. Your partner never really tried to get close or work any of the problems out. You\\'re getting thrown away because he or she is too uncaring and too damned lazy to put effort into the relationship. Out of selfishness and complete lack of regard your partner has taken away the one good thing you had, something that felt special. You have been screwed over and cheated, and you don\\'t have to be nice about it. You\\'ve been jerked around, and nobody should be treated that way. \\'8 \\'$. Ji li m 3! \\'S \\'$. Ji JE:!l\\'l *JI~id,n.l\\'ii1:m 56 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger While imagining the second scenario, what feelings did you experience? Rate their intensity from a to 100. Write down both the feelings and the rating. Finally/considcr the same situation whcre you\\'re told the chcmistry is wrong, there\\'s something missing, the relationship doesn\\'t feel close enough. Your partner appreciates and values you but would like to end it. As you listen, you tell yourself that this is sad and something you\\'re going to have to deal with. For a while you may feel hurt and sad and lonely, and probably will for some time to come as this was an important relationship. But it\\'s not the end of the world. You\\'ll need to rally your friends and get some support. You\\'re going to find other things to do, such as take a class, join a singles\\' bike club, and stop turning down party invitations. You dccide that in your next relationship, you\\'re going to gct feedback at regular intervals and make sure you stay more aware of hm\\'\" your partner is feeling. If you learn about a problem early enough, chances are you can do something about it. This is sad and hard, but you can cope. Write down your feelings and rate them from 0 to 100 while you imagine this last scenario. Notice that while each scenario described the same basic situation, the emotional response to each was probably quite different. The reaction to the first scenario is generally depression, and anger to the second. The third scenario, with its focus on rational thinking and problem solVing, usually triggers a bit of realistic sadness with a plan for coping. Notice that your feelings changed while the situation remained basically the same. What made the difference was thoughts-how you interpreted the rejection. Now turn your attention to the intensity ratings. Ratings on the a to 100 scale of intensity are generally 70 to 100 for the first two scenarios and 30 to SO for the third. Rational thinking and problem solving usually modulate emotional intensity. After doing this exercise yOll may have a greater awareness of the power of your thoughts. Life provides many frustrating, disappointing, and irritating events, but high levels of anger are created by cognitions that make a bad situation worse. While life can serve up many \"crummy\" things, people often make them worse by the ways that they think or the attitudes they hold. But you can learn to cope differently. The key to coping is to recognize the power of thoughts and learn how to change them. Changing thoughts, just as in the three scenarios, can change your anger. The good news is that change is real and possible. The bad news is that it takes vigilance and practice, lots of practice. But you\\'ve already taken the first step-learning to recognize the role of anger-triggering beliefs, assumptions, and interpretations about ev(;\\'nts. Anger Distortions Since thoughts play such a key role in both generating anger and increasing it, it\\'s valuable to identify particular categories of thinking that are most likely to crank up your anger. Below are listed six types of thoughts that increase anger. Following each are some alternative ways of thinking that help manage anger and deal appropriately with frustrating, irritating, and disappointing situations. Remember, life may serve up realistic negative events, but you don\\'t have to turn them into anger and fury if you know how to recognize and change incendiary thoughts. Cognitive Restructuring 57 Magnifying/Catastrophizing This is the tendency to make things worse than they really are. Events are often described as awful, terrible, disgusting, or horrendous. When you magnify, you then respond angrily and perhaps attackingly, as if things really were that bad. Examples: This is the worst thing that\\'s ever happened. My job is totally screwed up. I can\\'t stand the way that he or she is talking to me. He behaves so horribly, it made the whole party a nightmare. This is total shit. There are three things you can do to control the tendency to magnify. One is to be realistically negative. Call it what it really is-crummy, disappointing, frustratin~ annoying, a hassle, etc. If it still seems awful, ask yourself, \"How bad is it really?\" Then answer that question honestly and realistically. If you need to, compare the \"terribleness\" of your event to things like earthquakes that kill thousands, war, famine, and the like. This may help you see things as they really are. The second strategy is to use very accurate language. The bill isn\\'t \"outrageous,\" it\\'s \"forty dollars more than you expected.\" Your \"disgusting\" boss could be more accurately described as \"detail and mistake oriented.\" The third way you can control magnifying is to look at the whole picture. There\\'s a downside and an upside to every situation or relationship. Your friend is late for most dates, but is a good listener when you need support. Focus on the positive aspects of a person or a situation to balance or neutralize your anger. Helpful Coping Thoughts for Magnifying: It\\'s not the end of the world. It\\'s just frustrating. It\\'s just not worth getting all pissed about it. I\\'ll just take the best out of the situation that I can. Hang in there. It\\'ll be over soon. Getting all bent out of shape doesn\\'t help. Then I have two problems-what I am dealing with and being angry. Hang loose and cope. Don\\'t let it get you down. It\\'s not worth it. Why should I get all upset? Who will know or care in a week anyway? Look, I\\'ll do what I can. If it works, great. If not, well, I did my best. No need to go crazy about it. Shit happens, but I\\'ll develop a plan about how to deal with it. 58 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger .. Qvergeneralization You can make a problem seem bigger than it is by using words such as \"always,\" \"all,\" \"every,\" \"never,\" \"total,\" \"everybody,\" \"nobody,\" and so on. These go way beyond the facts, beyond what is really true. These terms make an event that happened a few times feel like something that\\'s continuous and bigger than life. Examples You never get home on time. Everybody was very unhappy. Every day you pick a fight with me. He\\'s always handing me things at the last minute. Things like this always happen when I\\'m in a hurry. Nobody ever gets things done on time. Nobody ever does it right. The keys to stop overgeneralization are: 1) try to avoid generalizing terms, 2) use specific and accurate descriptions of a situation (\"You were late twice this week\" instead of \"You\\'re always late\"), and 3) look for exceptions to the rule (What were specific times the person acted differently or the situation was reversed?). Looking for exceptions is perhaps the most important antidote for overgeneralization. When you take the trouble to recall how people sometimes act contrary to their tendencies, it makes things less upsetting. Helpful Coping Thoughts for Overgeneralization Be accurate. How many times has this really happened? Sometimes things go a lot better than this. [\\'m going to think about that, too. Put the whole thing in perspective. No need to get upset. I\\'ll think about exceptions when acted a lot better than this. I\\'ll keep my mind on the facts-exactly what happened and how often. Generalizing makes things worse. Stay with the facts. They are bad enough without making them bigger than they are. Relax and you\\'ll get through it soon. If I don\\'t make this bigger than it is, I can relax and let it blow over. Stay with realistic negative. No need to make things bigger than they are. They are bad enough as is, but I can figure out a way to cope with that. Polarized or Dichotomous Thinking. This is a special case of overgeneralization. In this case you tend to see things in extremes. Events are either good or bad, right or wrong, and so on. People are winners or losers, strong or wimpy, people love you Cognitive Restructuring 59 or hate you. When it doesn\\'t seem like the positive extreme is true (Le., something is not good or right, someone is not a winner, or something diminishes your strength or power), the negative polarity is triggered. You tend to see things as 100 percent wrong or bad. Dichotomous thinking is a big trigger for anger because when people behave in less than perfect ways, all shades of gray are lost. They\\'re seen in the extreme negative, and you react with extreme anger. One antidote for dichotomous thinking is to use more qualifying adjectives and adverbs (Le., \"a little,\" \"somewhat,\" \"a lot,\" and so on) and phrases that introduce the shades of gray into a black-and-white world. A second strategy is to focus on different aspects of the same situation. You may feel, for example, total disdain for someone, but if you look closely at multiple aspects of the other person, you may find that you hate some things, are neutral about others, and even like a few of the person\\'s qualities. It\\'s hard to stay black-and-white when you see people as complex and multi-dimensional. Helpful coping thoughts for dichtomous thinking: Things aren\\'t either/or, just shades of gray. I can see both sides of this, the good and the bad. Look at the whole picture. This is unfair, but there are degrees of unfairness. This is hardly a capital crime. Live with things being a little unfair and get on with it. I\\'m not a loser. People are not winners or losers. They do some things well and some poorly. Demanding/Commanding This is the tendency to elevate personal preferences and desires up to the level of dictates and commandments for yourself, others, and the world. These are the \"ought to,\" \"have to,\" \"need,\" \"gotta,\" \"expect\" type of thoughts. It\\'s healthy to have values, to hold them dear, to feel good when they are achieved and feel frustration when they are not implemented or achieved. However, it\\'s when you elevate your values to the level of moral dictates that problems with anger occur. The people with whom you feel angry rarely agree with your rules. Their perception of the situation leaves them blameless and justified. And their rules always seem to exempt them from the judgments you think they deserve. In summary, anger is often triggered by a set of commandments about how people should and should not act. People who behave according to the commandments are right, and those who break the rules are wrong and bad. If they break your commandments, you have the right to be furious with them. Common commandments frequently involve the following themes: 1. Perfectionism: I or others should do it right, perfectly, correctly, etc. 2. Others (key people) should love me: A certain person or persons should love, like, approve, or support me. 60 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger 3. Others (key people) should not dislike me: (not the same as 2) Other people should not express dislike, disapproval, criticism, or negative feelings toward me. 4. Things should be just and fair: It\\'s not right when things are not just, fair, kind, courteous, respectful (whatever a person\\'s standards or rules for behavior are). 5. Bad things shouldn\\'t happen to 1111.\\': I shouldn\\'t have to experience, deal with, cope with, or put up with pain, frustration, delay, etc. (a kind of narcissistic rule that the person be exempt from the difficulty of normal living). Examples of Commanding/Demanding He or she should have known that would hurt my feelings. They should not have done that. This has gotta be done by 5:00 r.:-\\'1 . She should have known I\\'m overwhelmed with work. He isn\\'t being fair; he needs to listen to me once in a while. He knows better than that; I expected more of him. The biggest problem with demanding/commanding is that people rarely do what they should do. They do what they need or want to do. They take care of themselves. There is no absolute reason why things \"should\" be the way that you want. Because you want something or believe in something doesn\\'t mean that others have to agree with you. The best way to cope with shoulds is to think of them as personal preferences or wants (\"I prefer ...\", \"It would be nice if ...\", \\'\\'1\\'d like it if ...\"). It\\'s better to think, \"I\\'d prefer he left the party with me,\" rather than, \"He should always leave with me.\" Stay with your wants, desires, and preferences-not shoulds. It may be frustrating, disappointing, and inconvenient when you don\\'t get what you want. Stay with the disappointment; you can cope with that better than the righteous anger. Helpful Coping Thoughts for Demanding/Commanding So what if I don\\'t get what [ want? Sometimes I do and sometimes I don\\'t. There\\'s no guarantee. No reason to blow up about it. Stay cool. People do what they want to do, not what I want them to do. This is disappointing, and I would prefer things to be different. But I can cope and make the best of it. Forget the shoulds-they only get me upset. I don\\'t like how they act, but I can accept and live with it. There are problems, fears, and needs that influence his/her behavior. There\\'s no reason why he or she should do it my way, other than I want it that way. Cognitive Restructuring 61 Inflammatory/Global Labeling A global label makes sweeping, negative judgments. Typical global labels include terms like \"stupid,\" \"selfish,\" \"jerk,\" \"loser,\" \"liar,\" and so on. Many labels are obscene: \"bastard,\" \"sonofabitch,\" \"asshole,\" \"f-up,\" and so on. Global labels fuel your anger by turning the target into someone who is totally bad and worthless. Instead of focusing on a particular behavior, you indict the entire person. Global labels are always false because they exaggerate a single characteristic and imply that it\\'s the whole picture. Some are just plain funny when you think about it. For example, calling another driver an \"ass.\" If you look it up, \"ass\" has two meanings-burro and buttocks. Now, how does a burro or the buttocks drive? Visualize it for a moment. See how absurd that is? Examples: That salesperson is an idiot. The bastard can go to helL He\\'s a little Hitler at work, a complete asshole. Why are you so selfish? My stepson has been a lazy loser since the first grade. She\\'s a total bitch. The way to overcome global labels is to be specific. Focus on behavior, not the person as a whole. Describe the offensive behavior specifically. What exactly occurred? How many times? What was its effect on you and on others? Leave judgments about the person\\'s worth out of it. Also, concretely define your terms (e.g., \"bitch\" = female dog; \"son of a bitch\" = male dog; and asshole = anus, or space between cheeks of buttocks). Helpful Coping Thoughts for Global Labeling He or she is not an ass, just a person with whom I have a disagreement. An ass? Now that\\'s funny. He or she is not a burro or the buttocks. No one\\'s bad, people do the best they can. What exactly is bothering me? Stick to the facts. Why am I swearing? It\\'s just frustrating and not the way I want, but I can cope with that. It\\'s just a problem, that\\'s alL So try to solve it. I\\'m upset and it\\'s a hassle, a hassle I can deal with. Children make mistakes. That\\'s their job. Boy, is he (or she) doing the job well! 62 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger Misattributions/Single Explanations This is about mind reading. When people hurt or annoy you, it\\'s easy to imagine that it was deliberate and meant to upset you. You jump to conclusions and presume to know the person\\'s true motives. Rather than thinking about the multiple reasons for why things could have happened the way they did, you focus on a single negative explanation. It\\'s easy to guess at people\\'s motives, but unless you ask and get a direct answer, there\\'s a real chance you\\'ve jumped to the wrong conclusion. Think of times when you made an assumption about someone else\\'s motives or feelings toward you and you learned later you were completely wrong. Sometimes misattribution may cause real harm. Have you ever made an assumption about someone\\'s intentions, found out you were wrong, but had already responded in a way that caused a big upset? Examples: He or she is doing that to get to me. They wouldn\\'t have done that if they were my friends (which means that they don\\'t care about me). The whole purpose of what she did was to embarrass me. He corrected what J said to make me look stupid. He did that to piss me off. The best way to avoid misattributions is to pay attention when you\\'re making assumptions about people\\'s motives. When you catch yourself, try to find a method to test the truth of your beliefs. Check out the facts. Find a diplomatic way to ask about the other person\\'s intentions. If you\\'re reluctant to check out your assumptions directly, try to keep an open mind. Tell yourself that you don\\'t really know what\\'s in the mind of another. Also, it\\'s often a good idea to ask others how they think about situations like the one you are dealing with. You\\'ll often hear very different assumptions about what\\'s going on. While sometimes your interpretations may be true, there are often other reasons or explanations for people\\'s actions that you haven\\'t thought of. Your anger may be inappropriate or exaggerated because you don\\'t see the whole picture. A very good way to overcome misattribution is to develop as many alternative explanations for people\\'s behavior as you can possibly think of. Think of your assumption as one of many hypotheses that could explain how another person acts. HelpfUl Coping Thoughts for Misattributions Don\\'t jump to conclusions. Check out the facts. I\\'d better check it out first, before going off half-cocked. I may not have all the facts. Getting angry doesn\\'t help me figure out what\\'s going on. Where\\'s my evidence that this is the only reason? Cognitive Restructuring 63 Stop the mind reading. Don\\'t second guess the motives of others. Blaming This anger distortion gets people really hot. Blaming comes from a belief that the other person did it to you, often on purpose, and that he or she shouldn\\'t be allowed to get away with it. Whatever pain you feel, whatever hurt or fear or loss, they did it to you. While blaming feels very good at times, it also leaves you feeling helpless. The power to solve the problem always seems to lie with others. They have to fix it. You keep waiting for them to change their bad behavior, but they never do. While so focused on changing the other person, you may forget that there are choices you can make. You may not be able to get them to choose different behavior, but you always have a choice about how you feel about and respond to what they say or do. Also, when you blame, you often become judge, jury, and executioner. You attack and punish angrily. The other person will then pull back or counterattack. You now have two problems-the initial one and messed up relations from your anger. Examples: You want breakfast in the morning, and that always makes me late. I could enjoy this vacation if it weren\\'t for your constant negativity. This house looks like a pigsty because you never lift one finger to clean or fix it. I could have gotten the job if you had bothered to proofread my resume. When bad things happen, when you\\'re in pain, it feels better in the short run to point fingers. But your pain will continue unless you find a way to solve the problem yourself. The key is to make a coping plan, something that either changes the situation or how you respond to it. Do something that doesn\\'t require any cooperation from the person you blame. Leave them out of it. A second way to overcome blame is to realize that people are mostly doing the best they can. Everyone tends to choose the action that seems most likely to meet their own needs. The people you blame may be doing nothing more than taking care of themselves in the best way they know how. Helpful Coping Thoughts for Blaming I\\'m not helpless-I can take care of myself in this situation. I\\'ll make a plan to deal with this myself. Blaming makes me feel helpless. What can [ do about the problem? I may not like it, but they\\'re doing the best they can. It\\'s disappointing to me, but they\\'re just taking care of themselves. They do what they need to do, I\\'ll do what I need to do. 64 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger Nobody appointed me the punisher. I\\'ll just take care of myself, and leave the blame and punishment to others. Recognizing Anger Distortions A good way to get practice identifying the influence of anger distortions is to review your weekly Anger Log. Right now, pull out last week\\'s log. Circle the main anger-triggering thoughts listed in the log-the ones that really make you hot. Then, next to each circled thought, write in which anger distortion it represents. Sometimes more than one distortion may be involved. If you have any doubts, reread some of the above material on anger distortions, and try to make the best guess you can about which one may be at the root of a particular thought. Your therapist will help you in the next session if you\\'re having difficulty. Homework 1. Continue to self-monitor anger using Anger Log JI. From now on, try to elaborate a little bit on your anger-triggering thoughts. Don\\'t just put down a word or two. Write one or two sentences that really get at the heart of the thought. At the end of the day, circle key automatic thoughts and write next to them the name of the anger distortion. You can use the anger distortions material in this session for a reference. You may even wish to see if you can start developing alternatives, more helpful thoughts like those listed at the end of each distortion above. 2. Review the two anger scenes that you developed as part of last week\\'s homework. Make sure you\\'ve written down for each scene the key angertriggering thoughts. Next to each of these thoughts on the worksheet, write down the type of distortion it represents. These two scenes will form the cornerstone of session 5. 3. Continue to practice relaxation without tension, relaxation imagery, breathingcued relaxation, and cue-controlled relaxation at least five of the next seven days. Keep a record in the Relaxation Log. 4. Try to apply your relaxation coping skills at least once eadl day in nonstressful situations. The goal is to become competent and comfortable when you initiate relaxation coping skills in real life. It\\'s okay to try your relaxation skills during periods of anger, but don\\'t be discouraged if it isn\\'t completely effective. In subsequent sessions you\\'ll be doing a lot more practicing, and your skills will continue to improve. Cognitive Restructuring 65 Preview of Session 5 This will be the prototype session for the remainder of the anger-management program. In this session, coping skills training is introduced. You willieam to arouse anger by visualizing anger scenes (you\\'ve already developed two of them). Once the scene gets you angry, you\\'ll practice reducing anger by using your relaxation skills and key coping thoughts. During coping skills training you willieam to visualize each of your two anger anticipation scenes until they feel vivid and real. You\\'llieam to use the details of what you saw, heard, and felt physically during the scene. You\\'ll juice up your anger with anger-triggering thoughts. After you\\'ve pushed your anger as high as you can go, you\\'ll shut the scene off and start using various combinations of the relaxation skills you\\'ve been practicing. You\\'ll always use relaxation imagery, but you may also use relaxation without tension, breathing-cued relaxation, and cuecontrolled relaxation to calm yourself. You\\'ll also calm down with coping thoughts. Cognitive Counterresponses For each of your two anticipatory anger scenes, you\\'ll work with the therapist to develop coping thoughts that will diminish anger intensity. Coping thoughts that have proven helpful for specific distortions can be found in the /I Anger Distortions\" section above. You\\'ll also find a list of general coping thoughts at the end of this session that can prove useful in managing anger. Generally, it\\'s helpful to have two or three good coping thoughts available to help you manage your feelings in each anticipatory anger scene. In the next five sessions you\\'ll get lots of practice identifying effective coping thoughts and practicing them during periods of genuine anger. 66 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger  ~ C) o ..J fd :o:1 ..c f- ,,,... ._.~~~.~._......................... ...~ m~m.~~.m __ ~ __\" _ ~ ~.. _..~ mm........._..; ...

Getting upset won\\'t help. Just as long as I keep my cool, I\\'m in control. Easy does it-there\\'s nothing to be gained in getting mad. I\\'m not going to let him/her get to me. I can\\'t change him/her with anger; I\\'ll just upset myself. I can find a way to say what I want to without anger. Stay calm-no sarcasm, no attacks. I can stay calm and relaxed. Relax and let go, no need to get my knickers in a twist. No one is right, no one is wrong. We just have different needs. Stay cool, make no judgments. No matter what is said, I know I\\'m a good person. I\\'ll stay rational-anger won\\'t solve anything. Let them look all foolish and upset, I can stay cool and calm. His or her opinion isn\\'t important-I \\'won\\'t be pushed into losing my cool. Bottom line, I\\'m in control. I can always leave rather than sayar do something dumb. Take a time-out. Cool off, then come back and deal with it. Some situations don\\'t have good solutions. Looks like this is one of them. No use getting all bent out of shape. If they\\'re trying to make me mad, boy, are they going to be disappointed. It\\'s just a hassle. Nothing more, nothing less. I can cope with hassles. Break it down. Anger often comes from lumping things together. I got angry, but kept the lid on saying dumb things. That\\'s progress. It\\'s just not worth it to get so angry. Anger means it\\'s time to relax and cope. I can manage this; I\\'m in control. I can\\'t expect people to act the way I want them to. I don\\'t have to take this so seriously. I have a plan to relax and cope. This is funny if you look at it th<lt way. Cognitive Restructuring 69  Coping Skills Training Agenda The primary focus for the fifth session is introducing coping skills training. This is a technique that allows you to practice utilizing relaxation skills and key coping thoughts to combat anger. Step 1 is to refine and practice visualizing the two anticipatory anger scenE\\'S that you\\'ve developed. Step 2 is to create effective coping thoughts to help manage the anger in those scenes. Step 3 is coping skills rehearsal, where YOll visualize the scene to the point of feeling angry, then use your relaxation and coping thoughts to lower angry feelings. Giving Yourself Credit You\\'ve worked hard during the past four weeks, and you\\'ve achieved a good deaL /t\\'s important to ilppreciate what you\\'ve done so far. First of all, you\\'ve learned to monitor and pay attention to your anger. By itself, this is a major step in anger control. Tracking the frequency and intensity of your anger, as well as monitoring anger-triggering thoughts, is a big part of changing your habitual anger reactions. Your second achievement is learning and practicing your relaxation skills. You\\'ve rehearsed the relaxation techniques in a quiet setting at home, and by now you\\'re hopefully trying them out in real life situations. Continue experimenting. Try various relaxation strategies in the doctor\\'s office, riding in the car, watching TV, and sitting at your desk at work. Start to use them to lower anger or other stress reactions (e.g., feeling tense or anxious). A third achievement is your increasing awareness of the role of thoughts and cognitive distortions in your anger experience. In this past week you\\'ve practiced linking your anger-triggering thoughts with key distortions. This is a good time to celebrate any changes you\\'ve noticed in your ability to control anger in provocative situations. Think about some recent anger experiences. Are you trying anything new? Are you responding differently? Are you feeling differently? Write in the space below all of your efforts to change your anger response: Keeping Track of Change 1. Relaxation skills. Note recent situations where you\\'ve attempted to use any of your new relaxation techniques. 2. Cognitive coping. Note any recent situations where you\\'ve attempted to change your anger-triggering thoughts. Record any times you\\'ve tried to reframe or look at the situation differently, or simply reminded yourself to cope instead of getting upset. 3. Behavioral coping. Note any recent situations where youJve acted differently during a provocation (e.g., lowered your voice, walked away, stayed solution focused). In this exercise you\\'re encouraged to take credit for trying, regardless of whether you always succeed. At this stage in the anger-management program, the important thing is to try to cope and respond differently. It won\\'t always work. You\\'re not expected to turn everything around in a few weeks, so just appreciate that you\\'re making an effort. 72 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger Coping Skills Rehearsal Coping skills rehearsal is something you\\'ll do each session during the remainder of this anger-management program. Your therapist will always lead you through the process. The key steps for coping skills rehearsal are detailed below. Identifying Anger-Triggering Thoughts and Distortions On your Anticipatory Anger Scenes worksheet (p.51), you\\'ve written the key element~ of the scenes, as well as anger-triggering thoughts and cognitive distortions. Developing Coping Thoughts At this point you need to develop two or three effective counterresponses to cope with the anger-triggering thoughts in each anticipitory scene. It\\'s natural while anticipating an anger situation to have trigger thoughts such as the ones you\\'ve written down. The problem is that they make your anger worse, and then things escalate. That\\'s why it\\'s so important to develop effective counterresponses that calm rather than inflame your anger. The key is to use what you\\'ve learned about anger distortions to \"defang\" each trigger thought. Once you\\'ve identified which anger distortion a particular trigger thought comes from, use the countermeasures and coping thoughts appropriate for that distortion. Here\\'s a quick refresher: Magn~fY;\\'lg/Catastroplrizil1g. 1) Be realistically negative (e.g., it\\'s \"disappointing\" or \"frustrating,\" not \"terrible\" or \"awful\"). Ask, \"How bad is it really?\", then answer honestly. 2) Use very accurate language. 3) Look at the whole picture. Try to find evidence that the opposite is also true. Ol\\'(\\'rgcneralization. 1) Avoid generalizing terms like \"always,\" \"all,\" and \"every.\" 2) Use specific and accurate descriptions. 3) Look for exceptions to the rule. Recall how people sometimes act contrary to their tendencies. Demal1ding/Conmwnding. 1) People rarely do what they should do, only what they need or want to do. 2) Stay with your wants, desires, and preferencesnot shoulds. Think, \"I prefer,\" not \"You ought to.\" Nobody appointed you God to tell the world how it \"ought\" to be. 1J~fJmn111{/tory/Glob{/1 Labeling. ]) Be specific-focus on behavior, not the person as a whole. 2) Make the label funny. Misnttribution/Singlc Explanations. ]) Check out your assumptions about other people\\'s motives. 2) Find alternative explanations for the problem behavior. Blaming. 1) Make a coping plan to solve the problem yourself. 2) Recognize that people are mostly doing the best they can-doing what they think will best meet their needs. Coping Skills Training 73 For specific coping thoughts appropriate to each distortion, review session 4. The following exercise will give you an opportunity to use appropriate countermeasures (from the material or anger distortions just reviewed) to rewrite the trigger thoughts from your anger scenes. The revised and defused trigger thoughts actually now become coping thoughts to help you manage your anger. A second step of the exercise is to find a \"general coping thought\" (from the list in session 4) that can also help you with each trigger thought. The last step is to underlie what seem likely to be the two or three most effective coping thoughts (including revised trigger thoughts) from the exercise. You\\'ll use these underlined coping responses to manage anger while visualizing the anticipatory anger scenes. Visualizing Your Anger Scenes During the session (but not at home) the therapist helps you practice coping skills by leading you through the following sequence: 1. Relax by whatever method or methods work best for you. 2. Visualize an anticipatory anger scene as if it were all happening at the moment. Use visual, auditory, and kinesthetic imagery as well as angertriggering thoughts. 3. Once you signal that you\\'re, in fact, feeling angry, you\\'ll remain in the scene for about thirty seconds. Then you\\'ll erase it. 4. After the scene is erased, you will use relaxation imagery plus one of the other relaxation techniques that work for you. You\\'ll also use several of your coping thoughts. Coping will continue until you feel relaxed. 5. Repeat the entire process using the second anticipatory anger scene. 6. Alternate between the two scenes until you get as many as four to six repetitions of each. If you have difficulty relaxing between scene presentations in the session, it may be due to key trigger thoughts you haven\\'t dealt with. Review the scene and what you were thinking while visualizing it. Are there trigger thoughts you have not identified before? If so, what are they? Maybe you have not developed effective responses to them yet. Are some of your coping thoughts not working? You\\'ll find more Creating Coping Thoughts Worksheets at the end of this session, and it may be helpful to use these to develop additional coping responses. Another option would be to review the General Coping Thoughts Worksheet at the end of session 4. Homework 1. You should continue to practice relaxation without tension, cue-controlled relaxation, breathing-cued relaxation, and relaxation imagery at least five of 74 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger the next seven days. Keep a record in your Relaxation Log. A fresh copy of the log follows this session. 2. Make a committed effort now to apply coping thoughts and relaxation coping skills once or more daily to various types of stressful situations. These could be situations in which you\\'re anxious or overwhelmed, but especial1y when you\\'re being provoked to anger. Write down the outcome of these coping efforts in Anger Log III, which is Anger Log II plus an additional column for recording coping strategies. A copy of Anger Log III appears at the end of this session. 3. Work to develop two moderate (50-70 on the 100-point anger scale) anger scenes. These should be events where you\\'re right in the middle of the problem situation. Choose events that happen often enough that you can easily bring them to mind and get a clear image of the situation. See the exercise on the next page to complete this task. After you\\'ve developed the two moderate anger scenes, do a Creating Coping Thoughts Worksheet for each of the anger scenes. Extra copies are found at the end of the chapter to work on other anger situations that happen to you. Use them to rework events in your log. 4. All significant anger experiences (over 40 on the 100-point scale) should be recorded in Anger Log III. Be sure to write these experiences down whether you\\'ve made coping efforts or not 5. Fill out the Anger Situation and Anger Symptom again (forms are found at the end of this chapter), according to how you feel now. Your therapist may also have you complete some other short questionnaires. Preview of Session 6 No new material wil1 be introduced in session 6. With your therapist, you\\'l1 fol1ow the same coping skills rehearsal sequence you learned in session 5.

During coping skills rehearsal you utilize the two moderate (50-70 intensity level) anger scenes you developed. Monitoring Your Progress At the end of the last session you completed the Anger Situation and Anger Symptom again. By comparing your scores for this session ,,,rith the first session you can see if your overall anger levels are decreasing. If the anger score has gone down, this is certainly cause for celebration. It shows that you\\'re achieving something with your hard work. The coping strategies you\\'re learning to use are beginning to have an effect. rf anger levels are unchanged or even climbing, you\\'ll need to explore what\\'s getting in the \\\\,vay of using your new anger-management skills. Look at Anger Log III from the past week. Are there notations about situations where YOll attempted to cope with anger? Which coping skills did you use? Were they effective? If not, what prevented you from trying alternative coping strategies? If a review of your anger log shows that you aren\\'t using coping skills during real life provocations, the next exercise is a chance to identify inhibiting factors that prevent you from using your coping skills. It includes things that commonly get in the way of using relaxation or cognitive coping skills. i: !: t;;;EI::::~ 1_ .1lil;U:1 Exercise: Blocks to Real Life Coping 1. You fear embarrassment if people notice your efforts to relax. Right now take a couple of slow breaths using cue-controlled relaxation in front of a mirror. Try to be honest. Does it look like anything more than a deep breath or a sigh? Isn\\'t it common for angry people to sigh or breathe deeply in the course of a tense conversation? In fact, cue-controlled relaxation doesn\\'t look all that odd. Even if you\\'re in the middle of a conversation with someone, you can take a breath and use your cue word while you\\'re listening to the other person or preparing your response. 2. Yau get too upset to remember to use your coping skills. This is a common problem; common but not insurmountable. You need a reminder to use your coping skills. A new ring or piece of jewelry might help. When you look at it, remind yourself to use your relaxation skills and to rethink things. How about an unusual color of nail polish, or putting your watch on the other wrist? If you did any of these things deliberately, as part of a plan to cue your coping responses, you\\'d stand a good chance of noticing them during the next provocation. Sometimes it\\'s just a matter of getting the anger problem more in your consciousness. For example, you could put up a sign on your shaving mirror: \"Breathe slowly and regularly when you\\'re angry.\" Or you could put a reminder in your wallet that you\\'d see every time you opened it. 3. You can\\'t think of coping thoughts during a provocation. It\\'s hard to think clearly in the heat of the moment, so the best plan is to identify key coping thoughts in advance. Any provocation that occurs with some regularity is a good candidate for planning. In the space below write three anger situations that come up fairly frequently. a. . _ c. ..._..._.. ._..... _ Now fill out a Creating Coping Thoughts Worksheet (found at the end of this session) for each of these situations. Select the very best coping thought you can from your worksheets for situations a, b, and c, and write them below. a. b. __ _ c. But what about provocations you didn\\'t expect and couldn\\'t plan for? You need a generic coping thought for situations that catch you by surprise-a believable thought that reminds you to calm down and not go overboard. Use the General Coping Thoughts Worksheet to find something that feels like it might be effective. Write it in the space below. Generic Coping Thought: . 90 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger Now commit yourself to using these coping thoughts whenever appropriate situations arise. Write them down and leave them in a place where you\\'ll see them at least once a day. Memorize these four coping thoughts. Practice them till they\\'re second nature. Driving alone is a good time fo rehearse them. Think them through, maybe even aloud, over and over until they are second nature and come easily. 4. You won\\'t i,e heard or get yaHI\\' point across, ~f you cope \\'with your anger. Some people feel that controlling their anger is tantamount to getting silenced. They\\'re afraid no one will listen if they aren\\'t loud and aggressive. Exactly the opposite is the case. When you\\'re angry, people get defensive and stop listening to your message. It hurts too much to listen to you; people end up feeling blamed and denigrated. Right now, do a quick mental survey of some of your recent anger experiences. Do you feel that your needs were heard? Was your point of view appreciated? It\\'s likely that in most cases people were too busy protecting themselves from your anger to hear what you had to say. 5. You have a strong need to punish people for their mistakes and transgrcssiol1s. This is a common feeling. It\\'s hard to find the motivation to cope with your anger when you want to use it as a weapon. But this impulse, understandable as it is, has taken a toll on your relationships. Take a look at the exercise at the beginning of session 4, where you identified the effects of your anger on multiple relationships. Right now, in the space below, write down the reason you are ready to give up anger as an instrument for punishment. If you can\\'t think of a reason that\\'s motivating and means something to you, you should bring this issue up with your therapist. 6. Anger feels like the only \"iflay to protect Yoltrse~f. Anger is a good defense against feelings like shame, hurt, fear, and guilt. If you use anger to block other painful feelings, reducing your anger may seem quite threatening. In the space below, write down the feeling or feelings from which anger has historically protected you. Discuss these feelings with your therapist and ask him or her to help you develop an alternative strategy (other than anger) to manage them. Achieving Maximum Impact with Your Anger Scenes You\\'ve developed four anger scenes so far (two anticipatory and two moderate). As the scenes move to higher and higher levels of anger, it\\'s imperative that they be Coping Skills Training - Moderate Anger Scenes 91 strongly evocative. They\\'re not going to generate much anger unless the scenes are carefully detailed with key emotional, cognitive, and physiological reactions. On the following pages you\\'ll find four sample scenes to give you an idea about the level of detail needed. Notice that the scenes always include the physiological experience of anger, as well as trigger thoughts about how wrong and bad the other person is. Scene 1: Oear Extemal Event-Moderate Anger (Scene level 65) I was on my way to work last week, on Thursday. I\\'m first in line in the lane that turns onto the on-ramp of the freeway. The light has just turned, and I\\'m starting to accelerate when a woman in a blue Ford appears out of nowhere and races right in front of me, right into my lane. She doesn\\'t even seem to notice what she did. I hit my brakes to keep from hitting her. My anger surges. I can feel everything tense up, especially my hands tightening around the wheel. My arms and shoulders tense, and I clench my teeth as I yell at her, \"What in the hell are you doing? Watch where the hell you are going. You\\'re going to get all of us killed. Stupid bitchl They should take her damned license away if she\\'s going to drive like that.\" There I am tense and shaking, as I\\'m pulling onto the on-ramp. Scene 2: Oear Extemal Event-Higher Anger (Scene Level 85) It was a week ago, Wednesday. I had just come into the house from work. It had been a hard day at work, and I had come home tired but in a good mood. I was just coming around the corner into the family room where I could hear the television was on. As I come into the room, I encounter Dan, my son, and his mess. He\\'s laying on the couch, and there is stuff all over the place. His coat, backpack, and trumpet case are in a pile in the middle of the room. There are two pop cans on the floor, and a couple of videotape boxes; the phone is out of the cradle and on the floor, and there is a bunch of other stuff on the floor, too. It\\'s like a surge of electricity goes through me-I\\'m instantly mad. That hot flash sweeps across me, and I\\'m tense all over. I\\'m thinking, IIJesus Christ, here we go again. How many times do we have to talk about the general rules about putting stuff away before watching TV. Lazy little shit! He always does this kind of stuff. He gets what he wants and then leaves it to his sister and me to clean up after him. I am not going to put up with any more of this shit! I\\'ve had it with being nice.\" I just want to come across the room and jerk him up off the couch. I start to yell at him. Scene 3: Extemal Event and Anger at Self (Scene Level SO) I was in my office four or five weeks ago. It was right after the project-managers meeting where we had been going over the production schedules and the financial statements for the last quarter. Both sales and production were down in my area. I\\'m sitting there with my feet on an open lower drawer of my desk and looking out the window. I just 92 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger can\\'t stop thinking about the meeting and how unfair it was. I\\'m thinking things like, \"What the hell do they expect from us? They take all of the computer support away and then wonder why things aren\\'t getting done. Idiots! If they don\\'t give us the resources, we can\\'t do our jobs. Same old same old. They make these types of decisions to save a few dollars and then blame us, the people who have to try to make their dumb decisions work.\" It makes me so mad. And once again, I just sat there and took it. I didn\\'t even once try to tell them what I thought about their plans and what I thought the consequences would be. I didn\\'t stick up for my people or myself. I get so pissed at myself for being such a wimp. I always ,,,,rimp out at key points like this. I\\'m just sitting there at my desk in an angry stew. My stomach\\'s burning and churning, and I feel like I can\\'t breathe, like there\\'s a big weight on my chest. I feel one of my headaches corning on and that kind of tight \"mask\" feeling across my face. God, I hate that feeling, feeling angry and out of control, but just sitting there doing nothing. I want to hit something or yell or something, but all I do is sit there and take it. Scene 4: Angry Rumination (Scene Level 85) I\\'m doing it again. It\\'s an evening at about 11:00 P.M. I\\'ve been sitting at my desk trying to get my school work done, but haven\\'t gotten a thing accomplished for a couple of hours. All I can think about is Jane, how she dumped me, how angry I am, how hurt I am, and how she\\'s probably out screwing some other guy. I\\'m thinking about how much I miss her, how lonely I am, but the point when I get the angriest is when I flash back on seeing her over at our favorite pizza place last weekend. There she was with a bunch of our old friends, having the time of her life, laughing, drinking beer and having a good old time. There I was miserable and barely even able to get Fred to go for a beer. Man, when I think of that I get really angry. It\\'s like reliving it all over again. I get that hot knife in the gut feeling, like it is slowly twisting and turning. My body feels like somebody is twisting it, like wringing me out. I just wish I could make her feel as bad as I do. I just want to shake her and make her feel what she did to me. Coping Skills Rehearsal As in session 5, coping skills rehearsal involves identifying trigger thoughts and cognitive distortions, then developing two or three key coping thoughts for each anger scene. You relax, using whatever strategies work best for you, and then your therapist presents the scene. For the moment, your job is to fan the flames of anger. Use every trigger thought you can to push the level higher. After you\\'ve signaled that you feel angry and have stayed in the scene for an additional thirty seconds, you once again begin to cope using your relaxation skills and the coping thoughts Coping Skills Training - Moderate Anger Scenes 93 you\\'ve developed. As in session 5, you switch back and forth between the two anger scenes until you\\'ve practiced coping with both between four to six times. While the process of imagining provocative scenes and getting yourself worked up isn\\'t entirely pleasant, numerous studies show that coping skills training is extraordinarily effective for moderating anger. By practicing your coping skills again and again, they become \"overlearned.\" They get so automatic that you hardly have to think about it. When this happens, your coping skills get much easier to use during real life provocations. They become almost second nature. Homework 1. Continue practicing relaxation without tension, cue-controlled relaxation, breathing-cued relaxation, and relaxation imagery at least five out of seven days in the week. Record results in your Relaxation Log, a copy of which is at the end of this session. 2. Start to apply coping thoughts and relaxation coping skills once or more daily to a variety of stressful situations. Note these efforts in Anger Log III. Use one of the four coping thoughts you developed in the exercise earlier in this session during appropriate situations this week. Remember to use your generic coping thought in response to unanticipated upsets. If a situation goes poorly during the next week, try to analyze what went wrong. Do you need to use relaxation skills earlier in the upset? Do you need to use different relaxation skills? Work with your anger-triggering thoughts using the Creating Coping Thoughts Worksheet so you can develop new counterresponses. Use situations with more anger than you\\'d like as opportunities to take them apart and practice rethinking them after the fact. In this way, you\\'ll be armed with them or similar situations in the future. You should develop two moderate to high (60-80 intensity level) anger scenes. These scenes may involve anger after a situation is over or where a problem is unresolvable. Examples of such scenes include: a) a high anger situation where you\\'re brooding angrily sometime later (e.g., brooding about a relationship breakup); b) a memory of a past event where anger is still high and intrusive (e.g., memory of an abusive parent); c) a time just after a highly disturbing anger event (e.g., right after a big argument with spouse or boss); d) situations where the event is over quickly, but anger remains (e.g., someone cuts in front of you in traffic); and e) an event where you chose not to speak up about something (e.g., an injustice at work or a problem at home where anger might have serious consequences). Use the worksheet on the next page to develop your two scenes. 3. All significant anger experiences, whether you made coping efforts or not, should be recorded in Anger Log III. As you have in the past, record situations that rate greater than 40 on the 100-point scale. Be sure to write down all events over 40 and at least one event per day, even if you did not have something over 40. 94 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger Moderate to High Anger Scenes Include visual, auditory, and kinesthetic details of the scene, as well as what was said and done. Describe your trigger thoughts, feelings, and physiological reactions in the anger situation. Moderate-High Anger Situation 1 Moderate-High Anger Situation 2 Coping Skills Training - Moderate Anger Scenes 95 Preview of Session 7 During this session you will continue with coping skills training. Anger will be aroused by visualizing moderate to high intensity scenes. As you have during the past two sessions, you\\'ll cope with anger using relaxation and cognitive coping skills. Session 7 will introduce a change in coping skills training. Instead of erasing the scene after thirty seconds of anger, you\\'ll continue to visualize the provocative scene while using your cognitive and relaxation coping skills. In other words, you\\'ll simultaneously create images that evoke anger while also using various coping strategies to modulate your angry feelings. This is closer to real life-starting to feel angry and coping with it. During session 7, the therapist will use fewer prompts to remind you of your coping strategies during angry scenes. The idea is for you to gradually take over full responsibility for coping so you\\'ll get used to initiating and maintaining coping self-instructions. 96 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger (\"\\') o \"C :::I cc en ~ II) ~ :i\\' :::I cc I !o: 0..

You\\'ll hold onto the anger-evoking images while simultaneously relaxing your body and using cognitive counter-responses. While this is clearly more difficult, it better duplicates real life situations where you have to cope at the same time you\\'re being provoked. Monitoring Your Progress Look through each of your previous Anger Logs. Do you notice any trends? Are there changes in the frequency of your anger (fewer anger episodes per week) or in the intensity of your reactions (average ratings going up or down)? Are you getting any feedback from friends, family, or coworkers about changes in your anger reactions? Are you noticing that you\\'re more able to modulate anger reactions before they escala te? The following exercise will help you identify coping strategies that you\\'re using to manage everyday strcssors and provocations. Exercise: New Ways of Coping The New Ways of Coping Worksheet that follows is designed to help you recognize changes in your response to frequently occurring sources of anger in your life. In the situation column, write down each anger situation in which you\\'ve tried to behave differently in the past few weeks. Under the column \"Old Anger Pattern,\" write down how you used to respond to the situation before beginning this program. How did you previously think about the situation-what were your cognitive distortions? Sometimes it\\'s fun to give silly labels to your old pattern. For example, \"My \\'everybody\\'s an idiot\\' reaction\" is a way to describe global labeling. Or \"Demanding perfection\" could describe a pattern deriving from commanding/ demanding distortions. \"The crystal-ball reaction\" is how one person described misattributions, and \"the God-awful button\" was a description for magnifying. In addition to identifying your distortion, the \"Old Anger Pattern\" column should include your typical behavior in the situation-what you did or didn\\'t do that seemed to make matters worse. Under the column \"New Coping,\" list any efforts you\\'ve made to use your relaxation skills in the situation. Were there any specific coping thoughts that you used? Recall new counterresponses you tried, or new ways of thinking about the problem. Write those down. What did you do or not do that is different from your old anger pattern? Did you speak more softly, choose more neutral words, or choose to withdraw rather than blow up? Did you push down an impulse to blame or use globallabe1s? Again, write these new ways of handling things down. If you review Anger Log III for the past few weeks, you\\'ll probably find some ideas to include in the \"New Coping\" column. However, many of your best coping efforts may be in situations where you never got angry enough to think about writing it down in the log. Your very success made the coping efforts forgettable. This exercise is an opportunity to recover some of those successes and take credit for them. Feel good about your coping efforts. It\\'s hard work and you deserve to give yourself a pat on the back. Coping with Current High Anger Situations If a review of your recent log reveals one or more high anger situations where you have difficulty coping, it\\'s a good idea to make a plan now so these situations won\\'t broadside you again this next week or so. First, use the Creating Coping Thoughts Worksheet (fresh copies are at the end of this session) to develop some strong counterresponses. Secondly, identify at least one relaxation strategy that you plan to use the next time this provocation arises. Planning to relax may not be enough, however. You may need a reminder system to trigger your relaxation efforts. See session 6 for a discussion of reminder systems. Another way to increase use of your relaxation skills is to develop a 181Wtl \" .. 106 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger New Ways of Coping Worksheet Situation The Old Anger Pattern New Coping (Coping Thoughts, Relaxation, Coping Behaviors) Coping Skills Training - Moderate to High Anger Scenes 107 reward that will reinforce these efforts. For example, every time you use relaxation skills in a target situation, you reward yourself with a dinner out, a small shopping excursion, a small amount of money set aside for anything you want to use it on, etc. Another way to reinforce using relaxation skills in target situations is to make an agreement with a friend that you\\'ll do so and regularly report on your efforts. To express interest and support, your friend might ask once a week how your relaxation efforts are working with the target provocation. Coping Skills Rehearsal with Moderate to High Anger Scenes You\\'ve already prepared your two anger scenes in the 60-80 range. You should also have now developed cognitive counterresponses using the Creating Coping Thoughts Worksheets. While your therapist will help you to develop coping thoughts, this is something that needs to become more and more your responsibility. The skill to create believable, forceful coping statements will be helping you long after this program has ended. Each time you put the effort into filling out a Creating Coping Thoughts Worksheet, or looking back to find counterresponses in the material on cognitive distortions, you are honing your skills and ensuring a future where you\\'ll have far better control of your anger. New Coping Skills Rehearsal Structure As in the past, you begin the rehearsal process by relaxing using any method you want for ninety seconds or so. Your therapist then describes the scene until you feel fully immersed in it. When you start to get angry, you raise your hand as a signal. This is the point where things change. Now, instead of being angry for thirty seconds and switching off the scene to cope, you continue to visualize the scene while coping. In other words, you do cue-controlled relaxation or other relaxation techniques and remind yourself of key coping thoughts while continuing to visualize the upsetting scene. You keep your hand up the entire time you\\'re feeling angry. As long as you\\'re angry, your hand stays in the air. Only when you\\'ve successfully controlled your anger using relaxation and cognitive skills do you lower your hand. At that point you erase the scene and continue to relax for a while before beginning the next scene. This is hard because you\\'ve got to do two things at once. You have to generate anger imagery while simultaneously coping with your feelings. But it can be done, even though it often takes a while to get used to it. During the first scene or two, your therapist will continue to remind you of some specific coping skills. But after that, he or she encourages you to cope in a general way and lets you decide how best to do that. You can see what works best for you to manage your anger. 108 Client Manual for Overcomir,g Anger Homework 1. Continue to practice relaxation without tension, breathing-cued relaxation, cue-controlled relaxation, and relaxation imagery at least five out of seven days. Keep a record in the Relaxation Log. A fresh copy of the Relaxation Log appears at the end of this session. 2. As you have for the past few weeks, continue finding opportunities to practice cognitive and relaxation coping skills during anger and other stressful situations. If you can predict an angry or stressful event that\\'s likely to come up this week, make a specific plan now for using your coping skills. Use the Creating Coping Thoughts Worksheet and decide which relaxation technique may work best in the situation. Then execute the plan. Record the actual outcome of the situation, and your coping efforts, in Anger Log III. 3. You should now develop twn high anger scenes (75-100 intensity). Use the worksheet on the next page to develop the scenes. 4. As always, any significant anger experiences (40+ on the scale) and all of your coping efforts should be recorded in Anger Log III. Preview of Session 8 Session 8 will attempt to synthesize some of what\\'s been learned in the past by introducing \"Best Coping Thoughts\" categories. With your therapist, you\\'ll review the coping thoughts that seem most effective during both visualized anger scenes and real life situations. Then you\\'ll work collaboratively to fit these thoughts into categories while identifying additional thoughts from the same category that might also be effective. Categories for best coping thoughts are: 1. Cool thoughts. These are reminders to use your relaxation skills. 2. Problem-sohling thoughts. These thoughts focus on alternative solutions to a problem or conflict. 3. Escape routes. These are self-instructions to walk away or take a time-out from a provocative situation. 4. Self-efficacy tlwl/gllts. These are reminders that you have the skills to handle an upsetting situation. 5. Reattributiol1s. Here you make an effort to find alternative explanations for people\\'s problematic behaVior. 6. Sec the whole pictllre. This category of coping thoughts is about the quest for exceptions. 7. Getting accurate. These are self-instructions that encourage you to stay with the facts while avoiding catastrophic thinking and exaggeration.

Coping Skills Training - Moderate to High Anger Scenes 119  Coping Skills Training - High Anger Scenes Agenda This session synthesizes some of what you\\'ve been learning throughout this angermanagement program. The key exercise for accomplishing this is the Best Coping Thoughts Worksheet. The worksheet lists and explains nine categories of coping thoughts. You\\'ll review the most effective coping thoughts you\\'ve developed so far and write them down under the appropriate category on the worksheet. Whatever has helped you cope while visualizing anger scenes or during provocative situations in real life, you\\'ll now assemble in one place-the Best Coping Thoughts Worksheet-to keep and use as a resource. In addition to your new list of best coping thoughts, session 8 continues coping skills rehearsal using the two high anger scenes that you developed as a part of last week\\'s homework. The format for coping skills rehearsal will be exactlv the same as it was in session 7; vou\\'ll turn on the , - anger scene, become angry, and initiate relaxation and your best coping thoughts to lower the anger. Remembering to Cope Even though you\\'ve learned and practiced your coping skills, real life anger provocations may still trigger strong reactions. More than anything, the difference between succeeding or not at anger management is your ability to remember and lise your coping skills at the critical moment. When someone gets in your face or does something that seems totally irresponsible, how do you recall your relaxation skills and coping thoughts as the situation unfo1ds? Right now, review your Anger Logs for the past few weeks. Note especially the \"Coping Efforts\" column. To begin with, take a moment to celebrate your successes. Whenever you\\'ve coped effectively with anger, it represents a lot of hard work on your part. Now, for each of the times you\\'ve coped with anger, think back to the situation. How did you remember to use your coping skills? Did you spontaneously remember? Did someone remind you? Did you make use of a prompt, such as unusual jewelry or other visual cues? Did you place a sign somewhere reminding you to cope? Did you decide beforehand on a criterion behavior-some action on your or the other person\\'s part that would be a signal to cope? Typical criterion behaviors include loud voices, a blaming tone, sharp or pointing gestures, swearing or name calling, pushing, and the like. Criterion behaviors might also include internal events such as an area of muscle tension or specific negative thoughts. Another strategy to remember your coping skills involves making a coping commitment to a particular person. A final strategy is simply reminding yourself at intervals throughout the day of your commitment to cope with anger. The following exercise will help you become dear about the specific strategies you use to remember your skills. On the left-hand column of the Remembering to Cope Worksheet, write down each of your coping efforts from the past two weeks. You don\\'t have to write much-just a sentence or a phrase to identify the incident. Now, in the right-hand column, write the word or phrase that describes how you remembered to cope. Example memory strategies are written across the top of the worksheet, but feel free to use your own categories for the ways you remember to cope. Now, look over your memory strategies on the worksheet. Which ones seem to be most effective? Do you tend to use only one or two strategies? Would you be willing to test additional memory strategies that seem like they might help? If you are, select three anger situations that occur with some regularity and during which you frequently forget to use your coping skills: Anger Provocation Memory Strategy 2. 3. _ Look at the list of memory strategies at the top of the Remembering to Cope Worksheet. Select one (that you haven\\'t tried before) for each of the provocations and write it in the appropriate space. Now commit yourself to using the selected memory strategy for each of the three anger provocations. If you can, take a moment and visualize the source of provocation. Now visualize yourself using the memory strategy to trigger your cognitive and relaxation coping strategy. Pay attention throughout the coming week to the outcomes. 122 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger Remembering to Cope Worksheet Spontaneously remembered; reminded by someone; memory prompt; physical or emotional signs; criterion behavior; commitment to someone; self-reminding throughout day; Coping Efforts 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. 12.

Coping Skills Training - High Anger Scenes 123 Best Coping Thoughts This is an exercise to help you review and remember the coping thoughts that have worked best for you. First, think back over the last three sessions of coping skills rehearsal and write down any of the coping thoughts you can remember that were helpful and effective. You\\'re going to use this list, plus coping thoughts from your Anger Log (\"Coping Efforts\" column) and the Creating Coping Thoughts Worksheets to complete this exercise. The point will be to synthesize these various coping efforts into a single worksheet that can be a resource for good coping ideas. If you look to the Best Coping Thoughts Worksheet on page 130, you\\'ll note that the coping thoughts are broken into nine categories. Cool thoughts include self-instructions to relax and calm down. Problem-solving thoughts are built around the idea that anger is just a signal to look for alternative solutions; a provocation is merely a problem to be solved. Escape routes are self-instructions to walk away from something upsetting; to remove yourself from a provocation before things escalate further. Self-efficacy thoughts remind you that you have the ability to handle the situation; you have the skill to cope with the upsetting feelings. Self-efficacy thoughts sometimes involve a plan for future coping and give you credit for what you\\'ve achieved in the past. Reattributions are simply an alternative explanation for the other person\\'s behavior. Why else might they be acting as they do? Sometimes humorous reattributions are particularly effective. Someone\\'s forgetfulness can be attributed to being \"brain damaged\" rather than intentional neglect. See-the-whole-picture coping thoughts look for exceptiOns to overgeneralization. You try to remember facts and events that counterbalance negative labeling. Getting accurate is a category of coping thoughts that reminds you to stay with the facts, to avoid catastrophic thinking and exaggeration. Getting accurate may mean facing that a situation is realistically negative, but not horrible, awful, and intolerable. Preferences, not shoulds is a category of coping thoughts that replaces absolute should statements with the language of desire and preference. The intent is to soften the angry expectation that other people should live by your rules. Instead, your rules become personal wants, desires, and preferences. People doing their best is a kind of coping thought that acknowledges how individuals try to survive and cope with the circumstances of their lives as best they can. They make mistakes, they behave in self-serving ways, but they are ultimately doing the best they can to manage problems and get what they need. 124 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger Now it\\'s time to tackle the Best Coping Thoughts Worksheet. You\\'ll find under each category of coping thoughts some examples. Then there\\'s a space for you to fill in the coping thoughts that you\\'ve developed in that category. As you work your way through each category on the worksheet, review the list of coping thoughts you made from your Anger Log, your Creating Coping Thoughts Worksheets, and coping thoughts you recall using during coping skills rehearsaL When you\\'ve worked your way through all nine coping thoughts categories, go back and do another pass. See if you can remember any additional coping thoughts and write them in under the category where they belong. Now make a third pass through the worksheet and read each of the example coping thoughts that are printed on the sheet. Put a star by any of the example coping thoughts that you think might be most helpful for you. As a final step, look at the coping thoughts categories where you haven\\'t written anything down. Consider each of these categories carefully and see if you can develop some coping thoughts of your own for them. If you have difficulty with this part of the exercise, your therapist will assist you. The Best Coping Thoughts Worksheet is going to be especially important to you after therapy is over. It would be helpful to keep it handy. Review it each day for about five minutes. Furthermore, you should write down on the worksheet any new coping thoughts that you develop over time. The worksheet will assist you to stay very conscious of how you\\'ve learned to talk back to your anger and will remind you of specific coping statements that have worked best. Coping Thoughts Rehearsal with High Anger Scenes You\\'ve already prepared tvvo high anger scenes in the 75-100 range. For each of the hvo scenes you should use the Creating Coping Thoughts Worksheets to develop cognitive counterresponses. If you have not done that already, fill out the worksheets now. You\\'ll find copies of the worksheet at the end of this session. You can also review the Best Coping Thoughts Worksheet that you\\'ve just completed for additional ideas about counterresponses in these high anger scenes. Think in particular about categories of coping responses you\\'ve never used before. Could you develop coping thoughts from any of these new categories that might be appropriate for the high anger scenes? Coping skills rehearsal for session 8 follows the same structure as the previous session. You begin the rehearsal process by relaxing using any method you want, signaling when you\\'re relaxed. Your therapist will describe one of the scenes until you feel fully engaged emotionally. You then raise your hand to signal the presence of anger and begin to cope using relaxation techniques and key coping thoughts until the anger dissipates. As in session 7, you keep your hand up the entire time you\\'re feeling angry and continue to cope while visualizing the provocative scene. Only after you\\'ve successfully coped and you no longer feel angry do you lower your hand. Coping Skills Training - High Anger Scenes 125 l1li111111 Best Coping Thoughts Worksheet Cool Thoughts \"Just stay cool, getting all pissed off won\\'t help.\" \"It\\'s just not worth it. Take a few deep breaths and chill out.\" \"This, too, shall pass.

This juggling act of doing two things at once should be getting a little easier. Be assured that this practice will make your real life coping much more effective. During this session your therapist will remind you less and less about specific coping thoughts and relaxation strategies. You need to remind yourself of each of the coping thoughts you\\'ve selected and particular relaxation exercises you wish to lise. Homework 1. You should continue to practice relaxation without tension, breathing-cued relaxation, cue-controlled relaxation, and relaxation imagery five Ollt of seven days between sessions. You should document your practice sessions in the Relaxation Log (found at the end of this session). 2. Continue looking for opportunities to use relaxation skills and coping thoughts in angry as well as stressful situations. All of your coping efforts should be noted in Anger Log III (found at the end of this session). If you use relaxation and cognitive skills for other negative emotions such as anxiety and depression, record them on Anger Log III, too. 3. You should now develop two \"worst anger\" scenes (85-100 intensity). These should be \"top of the chart\" experiences that are the worst kinds of anger episodes you can recall over the past few years. Use the worksheet on the next page to develop the scenes. 4. As always, note all significant anger events (40+ on the scale) in the Anger Log Ill. Anger experiences should be recorded in the log il\\'hethcr or not there were copillg ~[forts. 5. Sometimes in the course of anger-management work, anxiety emerges as a second major issue. Spend a few moments reviewing the past few weeks to determine if anxiety is a problem for you at this time. If it is, coping skills training can be adapted for treating anxiety. Tell your therapist about the kind of anxiety you are experiencing, and he or she may spend an additional session or hvo helping you to strengthen your anxiety-management skills. Preview of Session 9 Session 9 is the last of the structured sessions in this anger-management program. The session has multiple components, and your therapist may elect to break it into two meetings. Session 9 will begin with a summary of the changes you\\'ve achieved. You and your therapist will celebrate some of your new relaxation and cognitive coping Coping Skills Training - High Anger Scenes 129 skills. You will also explore the behavioral changes that you\\'re making in provocative situations. Most people find that when they relax and think clearly, they are able to better their behavior, too. Finally, you\\'ll identify changes in work and personal relationships as a result of using your anger-management skills. The next part of the session will focus on making anger plans. This is a structure for planning coping responses to new provocations. You\\'ll use and get familiar with the Anger Plans Worksheet, which provides a framework to identify which coping responses would work best for a specific anger situation. The worksheet is divided by sections: anger precipitants, coping thoughts, relaxation, coping behavior, and problem solving. Finally, you will do coping skills rehearsal with your two worst anger scenes. Your rehearsal structure will be identical to what you\\'ve been doing in this session. 130 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger Program Satisfaction Questionnaire (PSQ) Please evaluate the therapy program you have just completed by answering the following questions.

Coping Skills Training - High Anger Scenes 139  Coping Skills Training - Worst Anger Scenes Agenda In the first part of the session the focus is on summarizing personal change. You identify the relaxation skills and cognitive coping strategies that you\\'ve learned, selecting the ones that are most effective for you. You look at behavioral changes you\\'re making to respond more effectively to provocations. Finally, you identify some of the ways work and personal relationships have changed as a result of your anger-management efforts. Vou should review any other kinds of positive changes as well (e.g., less anger while driving, coping with anger generally, etc.). Since this is the last session, the emphasis is on how to maintain the gains you\\'ve achieved and how to prevent relapse. The key to relapse prevention is learning to make \"anger plans\" following the structure outlined in the Anger Plans Worksheet. In the last part of the session you\\'ll complete your work with coping skills rehearsal using the \"worst anger\" scenes. Celebrating Personal Change Step 1 In this last session you\\'ll again take the key anger measures that you filled out in the first meeting with your therapist. Vou\\'ve worked hard, and there\\'s a good chance your overall level of anger has declined. Reviewing the data from your Anger Log will likely show some decrease in the frequency and intensity of anger during the past nine weeks. Any and all gains you\\'ve made are entirely due to your effort. This is a time to appreciate what you\\'ve achieved. Step 2 Even if overall levels of anger have not changed significantly, you have still learned a lot. You\\'ve acquired and practiced relaxation skills and cognitive coping strategies. Your Best Coping Thoughts Worksheet is a good summary of what you\\'ve learned about changing old anger-triggering thoughts and replacing them with self-instructions to cope. Step 3 Now is a good time to explore and acknowledge behavioral changes you\\'re making in provocative situations. What are you saying that is different? Are you walking away from situations that used to escalate? Are you making and following a problem-solving plan? Do you use a different tone of voice when you\\'re upset? Do you pause to relax and get control before saying anything? Any and all behavioral changes that help you manage your anger are positive. To make sure you remember the behavioral changes you\\'re making, complete the Best Coping Responses Worksheet on the next page. Look back over the last three weeks of your Anger Log-at the coping efforts column-to gather information for completing the Best Coping Responses Worksheet. Step 4 Now it is time to acknowledge positive outcomes. Have there been changes in your work or personal relationships as a result of using anger-management skills? Are people warmer and friendlier? Are things going smoother? Are people less apprehensive and avoidant with you? Do you feel a greater sense of belonging, of comfort with others? Some of these changes may be subtle, some may take longer than nine weeks to achieve. But each positive change in a relationship due to your anger-management efforts is a big payoff. These are tangible signs that your work has made a difference. Are there other things, too, e.g., feeling better about yourself and in control of your temper, not arriving home in an angry mood from driving, having fewer anger-related headaches, or being less angry about your mistakes? Locate and celebrate these, as well. Step 5 This is a good point to think of the future. Your Best Coping Thoughts Worksheet represents some very good ways for handling anger distortions and cooling yourself down. Long after therapy\\'s over you can keep using these worksheets -and making new ones-to handle upsets. When you\\'re stumped by an anger 142 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger Best Coping Responses Worksheet Write down coping behaviors that have been effective during provocations (i.e., things you say that are different than before, changes in your tone of voice, walking away rather than exploding, making a problem-solving plan, pausing to relax and get control, etc.). ~ ~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~.~. ......... .... . . ~ ~ ~~ ~~-~. ~ ~ .. ~~~~ ........................... . ..- -...~ -. ~~-.. .. .......... ~-~~~~~-.._ -_......... .. ... ~~ -~.-.~.~~.-~ ... -.~.~ ... ~ ... .- Coping Skills Training - Worst Anger Scenes 143 situation, you can also use the Creating Coping Thoughts Worksheet to develop new counterresponses to anger distortions. You should continue to use your best relaxation procedures in provocative situations. They can help you to calm down and be more effective. Use them before, during, and after angering events. These skills will keep aiding you to stay cool months or even years after therapy is over. Continue to use them and they won\\'t abandon you. Anger Plans One key to maintaining the gains you\\'ve achieved is to develop a process for creating coping responses to new provocations. On page 148 you\\'ll find an Anger Plans Worksheet that will help you identify which coping responses would work best for a specific anger situation. The worksheet is divided into six sections: anger precipitants, anger thoughts, coping thoughts, relaxation, coping behavior, and problem solving. Right now, select a recent situation that you can use as an example for the worksheet. Visualize the situation. Try to remember the anger preciptants-any events, memories, associations, or feelings that preceeded your anger. Notice what was happening, what was being said and, most of all, what you were thinking as the action unfolded. Write your trigger thoughts down in the space provided on the Anger Plans Worksheet. Can you think of any coping thoughts that would help you in the situation? Is there anything that might neutralize some of the anger thoughts? Write those down in the space under \"coping thoughts.\" What about the Best Coping Thoughts Worksheet- is there something there that might help? Write anything relevant from that worksheet down under \"coping thoughts.\" You might also get additional ideas from the \"Anger Distortions\" section of session 4, as well as the General Coping Thoughts Worksheet at the end of session 4. Now tum to the relaxation part of the plan. What relaxation strategy might work best for you during this provocation? How would you remind yourself to use that strategy? Write down the relaxation skill you\\'ve selected, as well as how you\\'ll remind yourself to use it the next time the provocation occurs. Now move on to coping behavior. Is there any way you could handle the situation differently? Is there something you could say that isn\\'t attacking but gets your point across? Write down the ways you plan to act differently in the situation under \"coping behavior.\" The last step in the plan is problem solving. Do you have any idea of how you could structure things to avoid this anger-producing situation in the future? Is there something you could do or say when you aren\\'t angry that would change the irritating situation? Write your plan to improve the situation and avoid conflict under \"problem solving.\" From now on, you are encouraged to use the structure of the Anger Plans Worksheet as significant anger problems arise. When you run into provocative situations that occur repeatedly, and you\\'re not controlling your anger well, it means that you really need a plan. If you plan in advance for the next provocation, you\\'ll have far less chance of blowing up. After you\\'ve developed your plan, review 144 Client Manual for Overcoming Anger it frequently. Practice all the steps in your mind. Then, when it or something like it happens you\\'re ready-you have a well-rehearsed plan. Coping Skills Rehearsal: Worst Anger Scenes As part of your homework from session 8, you\\'ve already developed two worst anger scenes. Prior to coping skills rehearsal, you\\'ll need to develop several effective coping responses. Use the Best Coping Thoughts Worksheet as a resource to develop coping thoughts for each of your two anger scenes. The same rehearsal structure that you practiced in session 7 and 8 is used now. You relax, then visualize the scene while using appropriate cognitive and relaxation coping strategies. When you\\'ve succeeded in reducing anger to zero, you erase the scene and your therapist \"\"ill switch over to the second worst anger situation. During this session, the therapist probably won\\'t prompt you at all in terms of remembering relaxation or cognitive coping skills. You should be initiating coping on your own, shifting among the various coping strategies until anger is successfully eliminated. A Different Life Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about the human species is that we can decide to change. Usually we change slowly and haltingly. We change despite lapses and setbacks. We change in the face of fear and discouragement. But change is always possible, because we\\'re born with an innate capacity to see a goal and reach for it. The two keys to change are 11((Iareflt\\'SS and commitl1/(\\'llf. Awareness grows from a fearless inventory of the ways anger has hurt us and the ones we love. It comes from monitoring thoughts and behavior. When you reatly know your anger-how it works and what it costs-you\\'re halfway to changing it. The second key is commitmentdeciding not just once, but every day, that you are altering what you think, feel, say, and do. The commitment you made to start this program is different than the commitment to really change your behavior. Starting the program was a matter of making a phone call and an appointment. Changing your anger requires making a decision each morning that you will work to change how you respond to provocations that day. Your achievements have been significant during the past several weeks. But the day after this program ends is really no different than the days while you were in it. You still have to make that commitment each morning to change and maintain your gains. You still have to decide that today you will be working on your anger. Remember that real change is slow. Over time, new habits of response will strengthen. Old, problematic anger patterns will become less automatic and fade away_ Be patient. Dale Carnegie once said, \"What the mind of man can conceive   '"

      "1 Chapter 1 Case Studies Steve.\n",
      "Steve was a -year-old sales manager who suffered from attacks of dizziness, blurred vision, and heart palpitations.\n",
      "The first panic attack occurred at work, in the presence of his coworkers, and began with feelings of weakness, nausea, and dizziness.\n",
      "Steve asked a colleague to call a doctor because he was afraid that he was having a heart attack since his father had recently died of one.\n",
      "In addition to this personal loss, Steve was dealing with a lot of stress at work.\n",
      "Several months before the first panic attack, there were times when Steve had been nervous and his writing had become shaky; but apart from that, he had never experienced anything like this before.\n",
      "After a thorough physical examination, his doctor told him that it was stress and anxiety.\n",
      "Nevertheless, the panics continued, mostly at work, and in trapped situations.\n",
      "Sometimes they were unexpected orout of the blue, particularly the ones that woke him out of deep sleep.\n",
      "Steve felt tense and anxious most of the time because he worried about having another panic attack.\n",
      "Since his third panic attack, Steve had begun to avoid being alone whenever possible.\n",
      "He also avoided places and situations, such as stores, shopping malls, crowds, theaters, and waiting in lines, where he feared being trapped and embarrassed if he panicked.\n",
      "Wherever he went, Steve carried a Bible, as well as chewing gum and cigarettes, because glancing at the Bible, chewing gum, or smoking cigarettes made him feel more comfortable and better able to cope.\n",
      "In addition, Steve took medication with him wherever he went to help deal with his panic attacks.. Lisa.\n",
      "Lisa was a -year-old woman who had repeated attacks of dizziness, breathlessness, chest pain, blurred vision, a lump in her throat, and feelings of unreality.\n",
      "She was afraid that these feelings meant that something was wrong with her brain, such as a tumor, or that she was losing control of her mind.\n",
      "The problem began about five years before.\n",
      "While at a party, Lisa smoked some marijuana, and within a short while, she began to feel very unreal and dizzy.\n",
      "Never having had these feelings before, Lisa thought that she was going insane or that the drug had damaged her brain.\n",
      "She asked a friend 2 to take her to the emergency room.\n",
      "The physicians did some tests and reassured Lisa that her symptoms were due to anxiety.\n",
      "Lisa never touched marijuana or other recreational drugs after that.\n",
      "In fact, she became nervous about any chemical substances, even ones prescribed for allergies and sinus infections.\n",
      "The panic attacks waxed and waned over the years.\n",
      "At one point, she had no attacks for three months.\n",
      "However, she continued to worry about having another panic attack almost all of the time.\n",
      "She felt uneasy in situations where it would be difficult to get help if another panic attack occurred, such as in unfamiliar places or when she was alone, but she did not actually avoid many places.\n",
      "Her method of coping with panic was to get as involved as she could in other things so as to keep her mind off panic.. Judy.\n",
      "Judy was a -year-old, married woman who was unemployed because of her panic attacks.\n",
      "Judy quit her job as a paralegal several years ago because it had become increasingly difficult for her to leave her house.\n",
      "Judy's panic attacks involved strong chest pains and feelings of pressure on her chest, numbness in her left arm, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations.\n",
      "Each time she panicked, Judy was terrified that she was dying of a heart attack.\n",
      "In addition, Judy frequently woke up out of deep sleep with similar feelings, particularly pressure on her chest, shortness of breath, and sweating.\n",
      "Judy lived with her extended family, which was of Chinese descent and believed that the nighttime events represented demons descending on her.\n",
      "Her grandmother convinced Judy that she would die if she did not wake up in time.\n",
      "Consequently, Judy became very afraid to go to sleep.\n",
      "She would spend many hours pacing the floors when everyone else was asleep.\n",
      "Instead, she napped throughout the day, when other people were around.\n",
      "Her life had become very restricted to the house, with occasional outings to stores and doctors as long as a family member or friend accompanied her.\n",
      "Judy had seen many doctors and cardiologists, and she had undergone several cardiovascular stress tests and a halter recording to measure her heart over extended periods of time.\n",
      "Nothing was detected, and yet Judy remained convinced that she would have a heart attack or that she would die in her sleep.. 3 Diagnosis and Definition of Panic Disorder and Agoraphobia The mental health classification system used in the United States and many other countries, referred to as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders, fourth edition, text revision (DSM-IV-TR; APA, ), identifies the problem addressed in this workbook as panic disorder with or without agoraphobia.\n",
      "The key features of panic disorder are: (?)\n",
      "one or more episodes of abrupt, intense fear or discomfort (i.e., a panic attack); and (?)\n",
      "persistent anxiety or worry about the recurrence of panic attacks, their consequences, or life changes as a result of the attacks.\n",
      "Panic attacks refer to an abrupt rush of intense fear or discomfort accompanied by a number of physical and cognitive symptoms, which are listed below.\n",
      "Occasional panic attacks are common.\n",
      "However, not everyone who experiences occasional panic attacks develops panic disorder.\n",
      "Details about the frequency of panic attacks and panic disorder in the general population are described in a later section.\n",
      "Panic Attack Symptoms.\n",
      "Shortness of breath or smothering sensations.\n",
      "Heart palpitations or a racing or pounding heart.\n",
      "Chest pain or discomfort.\n",
      "Trembling or shaking.\n",
      "Feelings of choking.\n",
      "Sweating.\n",
      "Feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint.\n",
      "Hot or cold flashes.\n",
      "Nausea or abdominal distress.\n",
      "Feelings of unreality or detachment.\n",
      "Numbness or tingling.\n",
      "Fears of dying.\n",
      "Fears of going insane or losing control 4 Panic attacks occur as a part of many different anxiety problems.\n",
      "However, in other anxiety problems, panic attacks usually are not what the person is most worried about.\n",
      "In panic disorder, the panic attacks become the major source of concern and worry.\n",
      "Continuing with the technical definition of panic disorder, at least one of the panic attacks must be unexpected or occur for no real reason.\n",
      "In other words, the panic seems to occur fromout of the blue.\n",
      "A good example of an unexpected panic attack is an attack that occurs when relaxing or when deeply asleep.\n",
      "For some people, panic attacks continue to occur unexpectedly, and for other people, the panic attacks eventually become tied to specific situations.\n",
      "Another feature of panic disorder is avoiding, hesitating about, or feeling very nervous in situations where panic attacks or other physical symptoms (such as diarrhea) are expected to occur.\n",
      "Typically, these situations are ones where you may not be able to escape or find help.\n",
      "A common example is a crowded shopping mall, where it might be hard to find the exit and difficult to get through all the people if one has to leave suddenly because of a panic attack.\n",
      "A list of typical agoraphobia situations is provided in the list below.\n",
      "Avoiding situations because of fear when no real danger exists is called a phobia.\n",
      "Avoiding situations from which escape might be difficult or where help may be unavailable in the event of a panic attack or other physical symptoms is called agoraphobia.\n",
      "This is fitting because the agora was the ancient Greek marketplacethe original shopping mall.\n",
